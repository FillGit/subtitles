1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,880
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold?

2
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:07,424
I was supposed to call my dad back,
like, two hours ago.

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,092
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,220
He said call him as soon
as you get a chance.

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,764
-He's at Flimbees.
-What's Flimbees?

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,975
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use
when I can't remember the real thing.

7
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,979
Okay, hang up. That's it. Come on.

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,398
No. Rachel,
that's what they want me to do.

9
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,235
My warranty expires tomorrow.
If I don't get through...

10
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,112
...they're not gonna fix my crappy,
broken phone for free.

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,448
We cannot let them win.
It's us versus them.

12
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,116
Yes.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,578
-Hey.
-Hi.

14
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,581
Uh, listen, I gotta double-check
for tickets tonight. Who got what?

15
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,250
I have one.

16
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,961
I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

17
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,462
My boyfriend.

18
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,591
I have a boyfriend now.

19
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,551
Two it is. Ross, how about you?

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,846
Uh, yeah, I, uh- I also need two.

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,558
Really? Who's number two?

22
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,017
Whose Number Two?

23
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,229
One of the more difficult games
sewer workers play.

24
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,275
Uh, no one, it's just this person.

25
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,402
Like a date-type person?

26
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,530
Yeah, kind of.
Uh, it's this woman from work.

27
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,950
I hope that won't be too weird.
Will it, Rach?

28
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,912
No. No, not at all. I was actually
gonna bring someone myself so....

29
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,873
But you said one ticket.

30
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,129
I meant me plus one.

31
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,299
Okay. Did, uh, you guys mean
you plus one?

32
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,428
-All right. I'll see you tonight.
-Okay.

33
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,887
-Okay. Bye-bye.
-Bye.

34
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,306
Bye-bye.

35
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,890
Okay, I need a date.

36
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,354
Oh, hey. You guys are finally
gonna get to meet Kate.

37
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,107
And I, uh, borrowed some of your cologne.
I hope she likes it.

38
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,067
What are you doing?
That's never gonna happen.

39
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,571
-She's seeing somebody.
-Yeah. And I don't have any cologne.

40
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,950
-Green bottle next to the shaving cream.
-Oh. Worm medicine for the duck.

41
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,004
-Here you go. You can wear this.
-Thanks.

42
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,006
-Uh-huh.
-Okay.

43
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,636
Oh, I'm setting the phone down.

44
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,222
But I'm still here.

45
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,350
Just don't go anywhere. I'm still here.

46
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,604
Don't switch or anything,
because I'm right here. Just one sec.

47
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,566
One sec. One second.

48
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,403
-Wait. One second. Just....
-Phoebe?

49
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,905
What? Monica, I'm scared.

50
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,992
Okay. Honey, that's a sleeve, okay?

51
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,704
And we also have speakerphone.

52
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,706
<i>Please stay on the line.</i>

53
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,207
<i>Your call is important to us.</i>

54
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,418
You gotta hang up.
Because we're gonna be late.

55
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,462
<i>Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.</i>

56
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,298
Yes. Yes. I'm the next caller.

57
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,843
You were gonna have me hang up.

58
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,971
Hey.

59
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,849
Can you take a duck and a chick
to the theater?

60
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,518
-Of course not.
-No.

61
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,771
Okay, I just wanted them to hear it
from somebody else.

62
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,906
-Hey. Hey, Rach. Hi.
-Oh, hi, how are you?

63
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,534
-Good.
-Hey. Ha, ha.

64
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:06,163
-Ahem. Looks like we're the first ones here.
-Yeah, looks that way.

65
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,539
First ones here.

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,211
Hmm. Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.
Ross, Tommy.

67
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,006
-Hey.
-Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin. Cailin—

68
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,799
-Sorry.
-Oh.

69
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,759
-And break.
-Ha-ha-ha.

70
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,515
Okay, uh, I think I'm gonna run
to the ladies' room.

71
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,435
-Okay. I'll get our seats.
-I'll join you.

72
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,355
So, uh-- Well, this is, uh....

73
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,857
This is awkward.

74
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,192
Yeah?

75
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,153
Well, you know, because Rachel and I
used to go out. Ha, ha.

76
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,946
Oh, I didn't know that.

77
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,698
Oh.

78
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,993
Well, then this is awkward.

79
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,706
-So, what do you...? Oh. Yeah.
-I think we're here. Yeah.

80
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,333
Uh. Huh.

81
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,293
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

82
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,879
I think you may be in our seats.

83
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,257
Um, no, I don't think so.

84
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,260
-Could we take a look at your ticket?
-Sure.

85
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,723
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-13."

86
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,518
-And-
-Oh, well, I thought that-

87
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,980
You thought, huh? Yeah, well, that didn't
really work out too well for you. Idiot!

88
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,610
What are you, a moron? Huh?
It says, "D-13." Okay?

89
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,988
Look, you're surrounded by even numbers.
Does that give you some clue?

90
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,408
-Well, the usher told me-
-Oh. Oh, the usher must be right.

91
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,246
What, with all his training they go through.
Get out!

92
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,206
Here.

93
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,254
-Hey, man, you want the aisle?
-No, I'm good.

94
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,268
-There he is.
-There's our star.

95
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,019
You were great.

96
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,521
So? So? What'd you think?

97
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,650
Almost as good as the play with
the two naked girls on the seesaw.

98
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,653
-I wasn't in that.
-I know.

99
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,907
Hey, Kate, listen I want you to meet
everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.

100
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,202
-Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart.
-Hi.

101
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,747
Come.

102
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,461
So that's the girl you like.

103
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,383
I'm telling you,
this guy Rachel is with is crazy, okay?

104
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,261
He viciously screamed at total strangers.

105
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,722
I think he's bad news.

106
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,685
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You don't like the guy Rachel's dating?

107
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,020
Well, that's odd.

108
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,774
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys,
this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.

109
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,944
-Hi.
-Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

110
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,989
Oh, yeah. I ran into you in the hallway
in your building.

111
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,201
It was right after I slept with Joey.
He dumped me the next day.

112
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,663
So how'd you guys meet?

113
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,126
Well, uh, the short version is,
I pursued her for a couple of months.

114
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,296
Then I gave her a check for $20,000
and she was mine.

115
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:07,469
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him
for telling people the short version.

116
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,222
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous.

117
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,517
Hey, you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

118
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,894
How do you do?

119
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,522
Oh, you two girls were outstanding.

120
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,983
Do they have representation?

121
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,527
They weren't in the play.

122
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,405
-Huh. We're not actors.
-Oh. What a shame.

123
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,033
Because with her face
and her chest...

124
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,952
...I could really put something together.

125
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,164
Could I borrow it?

126
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,460
Hi. Remember me?

127
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,505
Hi. Yeah. Ahem, Tommy's in line
for the bathroom...

128
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,633
...and someone just cut in front of him.
I think he's gonna snap.

129
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,179
-Ross, I'm gonna go.
-Go? Why?

130
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,890
I don't know.
Could be because I don't feel like...

131
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,477
...standing around all night, waiting
for some guy who may or may not scream.

132
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,063
Oh, but Cailin...

133
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,232
...he definitely will scream.

134
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,526
Goodbye, Ross.

135
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,736
Oh, go, all right.

136
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,116
Here we go, people.

137
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:19,290
Ahem, <i>"Boxing Day.</i>

<i>You're the next caller.</i>

157
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,029
You were the next caller five hours ago.
You must be going crazy.

158
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,115
No, I've kept myself busy.

159
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,043
Oh, okay, yeah, I put your stuff in
her room and her stuff in your room.

160
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,883
Hey.

161
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,176
You okay?

162
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,512
Fabulous.

163
00:09:55,887 --> 00:10:00,767
Listen, drama critics, they're nothing but
people who couldn't make it as actors.

164
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,228
-You know what you should do?
-Become a drama critic.

165
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,235
I am hurt.

166
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,197
A plague...

167
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,200
...on both your houses.

168
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,747
By the way, he dumped me tonight
after he read my review.

169
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,707
Oh, classy.

170
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,793
Yep.

171
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,254
I sure know how to pick them, huh?

172
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,590
You know I gave up a part
on a soap for this?

173
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,425
Wow.

174
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,720
Yeah, I, uh- I gave up a job too.

175
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,765
-Really? What?
-Uh, declawing cats.

176
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,562
Hey, tell you what,
let me walk you home.

177
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,941
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn
every copy of their <i>Times </i>and <i>The Post.</i>

178
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,527
-Why <i>The Post?</i>
-You didn't see <i>The Post?</i>

179
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,613
-No. You?
-No. Why?

180
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,999
You really think these newspapers
are just jealous of me?

181
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,377
Oh, absolutely. You're talented
and you're good-looking.

182
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,463
Aw, you're sweet and cute.

183
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,049
I know. That's why they trashed me.

184
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,475
-Wait. Wait a minute.
-What?

185
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,188
I don't get you.

186
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,440
I mean, first you hate me.

187
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,568
Then you sleep with me.

188
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,654
Then you want nothing to do with me.
Now you want me again?

189
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,449
What? So you never went out
with an actress before?

190
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,661
Kate, do you even like me?

191
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,168
-Of course I do.
-So how come you blew me off?

192
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,963
-You know, how come you were with him?
-I don't know.

193
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,507
I just do this.

194
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,552
I always have to pick, like,
the smartest guy...

195
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,305
...or the most talented guy.

196
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,391
Why can't I just pick someone like you?

197
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,979
Thanks.

198
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,900
You know what I mean.

199
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,946
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

200
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,657
Joey, you're just so....

201
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,077
You're so...

202
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,246
...so....

203
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,839
Okay. Okay, okay. Ha, ha.

204
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,010
Here we go.
Let's get your feet up there.

205
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,894
Good night, Kate.

206
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,480
Sweet dreams.

207
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,490
I'm gonna put this can right here
in case you have to hurl.

208
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,917
<i>Please stay on the line.</i>

209
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,211
<i>Your call is very important to us.</i>

210
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,799
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours.
Go to sleep, honey.

211
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,969
-This isn't healthy.
-No, no, I'm fine.

212
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,639
And you know why?
Because of all the riboflavin.

213
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,060
-Hey.
-Hey.

214
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,063
Didn't you have that outfit on last night?

215
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,858
Yeah. I stayed at Kate's,
but, uh, nothing happened.

216
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,652
Hey, Pheebs, where were you?

217
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,573
I'm so, so sorry, Joey.
I am definitely gonna see your play.

218
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,368
I swear, your play is very important
to us. Thank you for your patience.

219
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,330
Your play is the next play
I'm gonna see.

220
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,667
-Anyway, how'd it go with Kate?
-Oh, it was great.

221
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,252
Yeah, I walked her home...

222
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,714
...and it was amazing
how much we connected, you know?

223
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,424
Then she passed out.

224
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,301
But then she woke up. Yeah.

225
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,386
And we stayed up all night talking.

226
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,264
And now we're, like, totally crazy
about each other.

227
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,351
-Joey, you had "the night."
-What?

228
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,271
When two people finally realize
their feelings for each other...

229
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,275
...and they talk for hours and they learn
all about the other person.

230
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,485
You think?

231
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,613
-Ha, ha. Did you learn about her family?
-Two brothers. One died.

232
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,615
-Yes.
-Yeah.

233
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,998
This is from the woman at the bar.

234
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,750
Oh.

235
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,547
Sorry. She thought
you were somebody else.

236
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,928
-What time is it?
-One.

237
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,679
Seven-fifteen.

238
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,723
Watch doesn't work.

239
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,311
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.
We're going to lunch.

240
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,692
Look. Look, I wasn't gonna
say anything to you, but....

241
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,530
All right, I don't think
you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

242
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,865
-You don't?
-No.

243
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:12,453
The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.
I think you should stay away from him.

244
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,999
Hmm. Or maybe I should stay away
from all men.

245
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,669
No, it's not just because I'm jealous.

246
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,257
I mean, I'm not, I'm not.
I'm not jealous, okay?

247
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,967
Look, the guy, he screamed...

248
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,011
...he actually screamed
at this couple sitting in our seats.

249
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,848
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he-

250
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:36,811
He got up, you know, and he just started,
like, banging his hands together.

251
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,024
Okay, fine. Fine. You don't want
to believe me, no, that's fine.

252
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,944
-We're kidding. Ross.
-Ross. Ross.

253
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,990
No one believe me.
I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny.

254
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,199
-Whoa.
-Sorry, Tommy.

255
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,368
What's in the cup, Ross?

256
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,205
-Um.
-What is in the cup?

257
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,540
Okay, it's coffee.

258
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,042
Iced coffee? Tell me it's iced coffee.

259
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,714
-It's hot-
-Hot coffee!

260
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,509
You idiot! You gonna spill
hot coffee all over me, huh?

261
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,430
What are you? Just a big, stupid
doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

262
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,390
Huh? Huh?

263
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,812
What's your favorite thing
about summertime?

264
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,900
Hmm, going to the beach
when it stays light real late.

265
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,401
Yeah.

266
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,030
-Hey.
-Tommy.

267
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,365
Say, what's your favorite thing
about summer?

268
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,536
Ooh, I don't know.
Probably the, uh, smell of freshly cut grass.

269
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,580
-Aw, that's a good one.
-Yeah.

270
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,505
Hey, sorry. Sorry I'm late. My duck and
my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

271
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,383
-Look, we held the curtain for you. Let's go.
-Okay.

272
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,434
Vic. Where have you been, baby?

273
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,732
-Where's Kate?
-She got a job in L.A.

274
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,068
What?

275
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:12,448
I've been waiting up all night
for you. Where have you been?

276
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,785
Where have you been, Vic?

277
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,287
Oh, uh.... Go to the window.

278
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,666
I wanna run down to the truck
and show you something.

279
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,462
What do you got down there, Vic?

280
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,422
What do you got under that tarp?

281
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,427
When is she leaving?

282
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,347
Tonight. What are you doing?

283
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,809
I'm coming up.

284
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,480
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

285
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,863
Why don't you use ours across the hall
because she...

286
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,448
...has problems.

287
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,950
Thanks.

288
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,661
Whoa. Whoa.

289
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,748
Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled
this hot coffee on you.

290
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,668
Ha, ha. Yeah, but you didn't. Ha, ha.

291
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,671
No, but it's hot.

292
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,136
Ross, would you just stop it?
It's getting really old.

293
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,346
I can't believe no one believes me.

294
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,098
I do. I believe you.

295
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,641
You do, Pheebs?

296
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,186
Yeah. But I also believed her
when she said I was next.

297
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,861
Ooh, hey.

298
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,821
Hey there, little fella.

299
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,365
Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how you doing?

300
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,369
Aw. Aw, ew. Oh. Ew.

301
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,204
Gross.

302
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,123
Idiot!

303
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,335
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

304
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,464
"Oh, look at me. I'm so cute.
I'm a little chick who's disgusting!"

305
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,133
God, you're so stupid!
How are you not yet extinct?

306
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,305
What are you quacking about?

307
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,057
Dumb Donald Dodo!

308
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,897
Step away from the duck.

309
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,194
Ooh, sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

310
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,738
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

311
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,576
Well, I guess we're not
going out anymore.

312
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,119
Man!

313
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,750
-Joey.
-Kate.

314
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,960
I'm so glad I caught you.
I couldn't find you before.

315
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,338
What's going on?
What's all this about L.A.?

316
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,590
They still want me for <i>General Hospital.</i>

317
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,551
But what about us?

318
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,680
Last night was wonderful.

319
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,100
But I can't stay here just for you.

320
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,103
Well, so stay for the museums.

321
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,356
-I'm sorry.
-Joey, on-stage.

322
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,275
Well, can you stay
till the end of the play?

323
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,278
I mean, I'll go to the airport with you.
I want to say goodbye.

324
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,364
Where are you, Vic?

325
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,700
Flight's in an hour. I gotta go.

326
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,326
Vic?

327
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,911
Vic?

328
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,456
-Vic!
-In a minute.

329
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,961
So this is it, Victor?

330
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,756
Yeah. I guess it is.

331
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,640
Listen, I, uh....

332
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,644
I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say
it quick because this is killing me.

333
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,899
One thing you gotta know
is that I will never forget you.

334
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,361
But you got things you have to do now.

335
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,321
And so do I.

336
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,533
And so...

337
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,954
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...

338
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,798
...and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7
in search of alternative fuels.

339
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,179
But when I return
200 years from now...

340
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,473
...you'll be long gone...

341
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,559
...but I won't have aged at all.

342
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,566
So you tell your great,
great granddaughter...

343
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:16,901
...to look me up.

344
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,071
Because, Adrianne...

345
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,781
...baby...

346
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,535
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

347
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,587
So long, Vic.

348
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,347
Phoebe, it's been two days.

349
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,057
Yeah, I know.

350
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,227
Ugh, good thing it's one of those
801 numbers, right?

351
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:56,482
Phoebe, 800 is toll free. 801 is Utah.

352
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,194
No, no, no.

353
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,864
It has to be 800 because all those
big companies have 800 numbers.

354
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,407
Every....

355
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,203
Yeah, every big Utah-based company
has one.

356
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,579
Phoebe.

357
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,833
Sorry. I'm so sorry. I will pay you back.

358
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,835
And yet she's still not
hanging up the phone.

359
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,712
-Hang up.
-Hang up the phone.

360
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,422
Fine. Fine.

361
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,383
Oh. Oh.

362
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,512
What?

363
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,349
Well, I think I broke it.

364
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,603
But that's all right.
Here's the number where you can call.

365
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,105
Oh.
