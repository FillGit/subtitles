1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:05,756
Do you think there's a town
in Missouri or someplace...

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,341
...called Sample?

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,512
And as you're driving into the town,
there's a sign and it says:

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,764
"You're in Sample."

5
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,768
-Hey.
-Hey.

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,103
-How did it go with Pete?
-Tell us.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,606
You're not gonna believe this.
So I go-

8
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,816
I'm sorry. Excuse us.

9
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,948
-It's a little crowded. Do you mind?
-Could you skooch?

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,116
Move over just a little bit.

11
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,786
Keep on skooching.

12
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,204
Thank you.

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,874
So, guys, listen.
I go over there and, you know, I'm-

14
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,126
Why? What is wrong with me?

15
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,170
-What's the matter?
-Tim...

16
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,172
...I have a feeling...

17
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,134
...my wife is sleeping
with her gynecologist.

18
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,138
How do you know?

19
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,974
-He's got access.
-I know.

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,561
It's a feeling you get.

21
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,021
Like when you're in
somebody else's bowling shoes?

22
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,314
That's the one.

23
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,318
-So you went to Pete's.
-What happened?

24
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,821
Why is this happening to me?

25
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,656
Maybe it's my wound.

26
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:13,991
Forget it.

27
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,327
It's not healed yet?

28
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,912
It's oozing!

29
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,832
Would you pass the cream?
There's the cream.

30
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,500
Thank you very much.

31
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:28,505
Tomas, this is gonna be hard,
but I wanted it to come from me.

32
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,383
-What is it?
-I've been sleeping with your wife.

33
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:32,676
You're the gynecologist?

34
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,679
I'm trying to have
a private conversation.

35
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,309
Can I have a napkin?
Could you please hand me a napkin?

36
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,894
Just give me the thing, all right?

37
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,230
Enough!

38
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,858
And you are no longer my friend!

39
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,068
We are finished! <i>Nada! </i>No more!

40
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,321
You are a bastard for doing that!

41
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,031
Stay away from me!

42
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:55,866
Come back!

43
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,044
So what were you gonna tell us?

44
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,212
I have no idea.

45
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,225
What was the big news
Pete wanted to tell you?

46
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,685
Or should I say, "Mrs. Monica Becker"?

47
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,814
Oh, keep your name.
Don't take his name.

48
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,273
He didn't ask me to marry him.

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,860
-Aw.
-Then definitely don't take his name!

50
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,824
He wanted to tell me he's going
to compete in some Ultimate...

51
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,826
...Fighting Competition thingy.

52
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,412
-Pete?
-Why? What is it?

53
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,248
I don't know exactly.
It's sort of like wrestling.

54
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,709
-Oh?
-But without the costumes.

55
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,460
Oh.

56
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,879
And it's not fake.
It's totally brutal.

57
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,342
It's two guys in the ring and
the rules are, "There are no rules"!

58
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,762
You can bite and pull
people's hair and stuff?

59
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,266
Anything goes except eye-gouging
and fish-hooking.

60
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,935
-What's fish-hooking?
-What's fish-hook-

61
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,524
Thanks. That would have been
hard to describe.

62
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,401
What is that taste?

63
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,655
My hands are totally clean.
I just gave the duck a bath.

64
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,035
Thanks for the warm welcome.

65
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,707
It's good to have you guys on my team.
I come to play. I hope you do too.

66
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,418
Let's go out there and get them!
And remember:

67
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,212
There is no I in "team."

68
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:18,467
Yes, but there's two in "martini."
So, everybody, back to my office.

69
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,304
You! Chuckles. What's your name?

70
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,639
It's Bing, sir.
I'm sorry. I was just....

71
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,268
No, no. I heard what you said.
Funny. I like funny.

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,438
This team's about hard work,
but it's also about having fun.

73
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,690
Good to have you aboard, Bing!

74
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,407
That's right. Ryder.

75
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,494
Winona Ryder for six.

76
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,080
Thank you.

77
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,583
-Yeah. We have the reservations.
-Yes!

78
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,336
All right, buddy! Way to go!

79
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,381
Dude, what are you doing?

80
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:03,428
Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my
butt and acting like it's no big deal.

81
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,180
What'd you do about it?

82
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,141
I didn't do anything.
I didn't want to be the guy...

83
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,228
...who has a problem with his boss
slapping his bottom.

84
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,398
I gotta tell you, I think it's okay
to be that guy.

85
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,901
Maybe it's that jock thing.

86
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,863
You know, how football players
pat each other after touchdowns.

87
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,284
You know, I don't understand guys.

88
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,996
I mean, I would never congratulate
Monica on a great stew...

89
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,457
...by, you know, grabbing her boob.

90
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,503
I know. For a really great stew,
you'd just...

91
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,547
...stick your head in between them.

92
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,675
Can we please go eat?

93
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,011
-Yeah, what are we getting?
-Anything but stew.

94
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,516
So from now on, don't give
your boss a chance to get you.

95
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,476
Don't turn your back to him.

96
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,646
Or you could teach him
a lesson, you know?

97
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:59,484
What you do is rub something that
smells really bad on your butt, right?

98
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,071
Then when he goes to smack you,
his hand will smell.

99
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,494
Now, what could you rub on your butt
that would smell bad?

100
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,499
What if Joey was President?

101
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,296
Can I ask you something?

102
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,756
-Yeah.
-Okay, you can totally say no...

103
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:26,011
...but would it be okay with you
if I set Ross up on a date?

104
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,097
Oh. Uh, with who?

105
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,183
My friend Bonnie.
She always thought Ross was cute...

106
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,061
...and she asked if I could set it up.

107
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,981
-But if that's not cool....
-Which one is Bonnie?

108
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,692
You remember her from
my birthday party?

109
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,069
Average height...

110
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,530
...medium build, bald....

111
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,324
Oh!

112
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,827
That's fine.

113
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,664
Great! Okay! Good for you!
All right!

114
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,131
You are iron! You are steel!

115
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,385
Let me ask you, how come when I call
your computer support line...

116
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,679
...I have to wait an hour and a half?

117
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,433
We're adding operators all the time.
Could we concentrate on my training?

118
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:17,062
It's just hard when I know
I have e-mail I can't get.

119
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,816
-Hi.
-Monica!

120
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,069
Hi, honey.

121
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,446
On the table. On the table, please.

122
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:33,244
Hey, um, so listen, my friends were
telling me a little bit about...

123
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,246
...this Ultimate Fighting thing.

124
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,457
It sounds really dangerous.

125
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,794
I don't want you to get hurt,
because I kind of like you.

126
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,422
I don't want to get hurt either.
I'm being smart about this.

127
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,676
See these guys? They're
the best trainers in the world.

128
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,803
Hoshi was a paid assassin.

129
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,140
A housepainter!
He used to be a housepainter!

130
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,521
-Promise me you'll be careful.
-I promise.

131
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,732
Are we still on for tonight?
Good. Because...

132
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,276
...maybe we could have
a little workout of our own.

133
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,654
No! No boom-boom before big fight!

134
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,993
How about just a boom?

135
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,001
That was depressing.
I just bought a pretzel...

136
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,294
...from one of the kids from <i>Fame.</i>

137
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,215
-Ready to go to the movies?
-Mm-hm. Oh, this is Bonnie!

138
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,508
Hi.

139
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,677
This is Bonnie?

140
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,887
This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?

141
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,015
I can show you an I.D. if you want.

142
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:40,270
Oh, no. You look a lot different
than the last time I saw you.

143
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,398
Oh, yeah. Well, I just
started wearing bras again.

144
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,942
Oh, that must be it.

145
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,737
Have fun tonight.

146
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,155
Thanks. You too.

147
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,163
You said she was bald.

148
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,206
She was bald. She's not now.

149
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,169
How could you not tell me
she has hair?

150
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,297
I don't know.
I hardly ever say that about people.

151
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,382
Oh, well this is just perfect!

152
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,011
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought you said it was okay.

153
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,724
I said it was okay when I thought
she was some weird bald chick.

154
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,477
That girl has got hair
all over her head!

155
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:27,108
-Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
-Does she have a bad personality?

156
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,402
Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!

157
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,659
Bing!

158
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,080
Read your CompuTek proposal.
Real home run.

159
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,293
Ooh. Barely got you that time.
Get over here!

160
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,003
Come on.

161
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,214
Oh, yeah! Good one.

162
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,008
That was a good one.
Keep at it, team!

163
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,303
-What is with him?
-"With him"?

164
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,972
You're his favorite.
You're his guy!

165
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,599
We never get smacked.

166
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,269
That's not true.
He smacked you once.

167
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,648
Not on purpose.
He ricocheted off you and got me.

168
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,984
I'm telling you,
I need some smacks.

169
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,487
I got a kid starting Dartmouth.

170
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,490
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth?
Dartmouth sucks!

171
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,200
-You go to Dartmouth?
-No, sir.

172
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,786
There you go! Ha-ha-ha.

173
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,335
Hey.

174
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,045
God, Ross! What is that?

175
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,922
The Ultimate Fighting Combo.

176
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,217
I saved 30 cents.
Plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!

177
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,888
From New York City, New York...

178
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,268
...appearing in his Ultimate
Fighting Championship debut...

179
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:47,272
...he's known for his
confrontational business style!

180
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,901
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing...

181
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,612
...Pete Becker!

182
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,661
I love you, Pete!

183
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,794
And his opponent
from Huntington Beach, California...

184
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,798
...he's a 300-pound
street fighter...

185
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,718
...Tank Abbott!

186
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,306
Boo! Boo!

187
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,482
Pete? Pete?

188
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,110
-That guy's pretty huge.
-Don't worry.

189
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,821
I'll use his strength
and weight against him.

190
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:41,326
Well, then that guy is in serious,
serious trouble.

191
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,208
You go get him. Let's go!

192
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,252
Here we go, gentlemen.

193
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,837
Are you ready?

194
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,509
Are you ready?
Then let's get it on!

195
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,559
Uh-oh!

196
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,739
Hey.

197
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,824
It's me.

198
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,452
Monica.

199
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,832
Can I just tell you how proud
I am of you?

200
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:34,087
It would be nice after hearing
20,000 people chant, "You suck!"

201
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,298
I thought you were nuts at first...

202
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,092
...but you did it.

203
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,512
Now you can just look back at this
with no regrets.

204
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,180
Look back?

205
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,849
You're not gonna keep going?

206
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,937
Let me ask you a question:
Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?

207
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,691
Well, no. But-

208
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,278
I'm not gonna stop until I'm
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

209
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:03,157
That guy stood on your neck
until you passed out.

210
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,660
Let me tell you a story.

211
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,873
When I set out to create MOSS 865,
do you think it happened overnight?

212
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:15,545
No. There was MOSS 1
that burned down my dad's garage.

213
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,716
There was MOSS 2 that would only
schedule appointments in January.

214
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,218
And 862 others that I learned from.

215
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,222
Just like I learned from this fight
never to let a guy stand on my neck.

216
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,725
You didn't know that already?

217
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,228
Look, I'm gonna get better.

218
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,189
Okay? I promise you.

219
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,567
Okay.

220
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,237
Just get a lot better.

221
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,072
Fast.

222
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,326
One other thing.

223
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:50,246
Hoshi thinks you being ringside
may have affected my concentration.

224
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,248
Yeah.

225
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,250
That was the problem.

226
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,760
-How long until Pete's fight?
-About five minutes.

227
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,720
They're interviewing his opponent.

228
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:10,058
Apparently, he trains by going to Iran
and pulling the arms off thieves.

229
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,603
-Wow. Ha, ha. Hot dog?
-Four, please.

230
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,772
I'm really nervous.

231
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:17,774
Thank you.

232
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,196
So how did it go with Bonnie?

233
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,617
Oh, I gotta tell you,
I wasn't expecting to like her at all.

234
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,787
I actually wasn't expecting
to like anyone right now.

235
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,081
But she's really terrific.

236
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,290
It's too bad.

237
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,170
No, I'm saying I liked her.

238
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,297
There are other fish in the sea.

239
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,802
I think she's great, okay?
We're going out again.

240
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,639
I hear you. Are you capable
of talking about anything else?

241
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,476
Which one's my turkey burger?

242
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,978
The one next to my foot.
Sorry.

243
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,232
-Fight's starting!
-We'll be right in.

244
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,318
So did your boss try
to slap you again today?

245
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,986
Nine times.

246
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,447
I had to put on lotion.

247
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,494
But it'll be okay.
Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.

248
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,748
And if all goes as planned,
my butt will be smack-free.

249
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,625
Fight's over!

250
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,674
Excuse me, Doug?

251
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,137
Hey there, sports fan!

252
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,973
Bing! You got those numbers for me?

253
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,100
No. I didn't do them.

254
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,227
Oh. You forgot?

255
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,938
No, I just didn't do them.

256
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,859
Instead, I hung out with some
friends and had a couple of beers.

257
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,820
So I certainly don't
deserve praise. Verbal...

258
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,655
...or otherwise.

259
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,367
I got tanked myself last night.
Pretty dicey drive home.

260
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,036
Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.
Ha, ha.

261
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,291
That's okay. You're still
my number one guy! Bing!

262
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,127
-Doug!
-Hmm?

263
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:05,840
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with
the way that you express yourself.

264
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,634
Is it the swearing?
Is it the constant swearing?

265
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:12,847
Because I gotta tell you, if it is,
you can just kiss my ass!

266
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,643
No. It's not about the swearing.
It's more about...

267
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,354
...the way that you occasionally...

268
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:24,066
...concentrate your enthusiasm...

269
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,903
...on my buttocks.

270
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,322
Oh.

271
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,283
Don't get me wrong,
I appreciate the sentiment.

272
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,329
It's just that I have a rather
sensitive posterior.

273
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,417
And besides, it's making
all the other guys jealous.

274
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,671
Well, say no more. You know,
it takes guts to bring this up.

275
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,882
Bing, you're okay.

276
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,091
Okay.

277
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,510
-Ha! Ah!
-Ah!

278
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,729
Would you rather live in the
shirt pocket of a sweaty giant...

279
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,440
...or inside his shower drain?

280
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,735
Oh, my God.

281
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,363
Look. It's Ross and that girl.

282
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:18,204
Look at that! It's a line of ants!
They're working as a team!

283
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:24,335
Right. Oh, yeah. It looks
like Ross is breaking up with her.

284
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,045
I hope he lets her down easy.

285
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,257
Look at that! They are not
breaking up! Look at them!

286
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,468
You know what that is?
A second date, that's what that is.

287
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,471
Look, she just put her hand
on his thigh.

288
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,307
That's nothing.
She's very sexually aggressive.

289
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,600
Oh, God!

290
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,647
It's your fault. Now he loves her.
He'll marry her. It's all your fault.

291
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,857
You said it was okay.

292
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,235
You said she was bald!

293
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,989
Was! Was, was, was!

294
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:58,327
We can't let it happen. We have to do
something. We have to break them up.

295
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,790
Just go in there and shave her head!
You owe me one bald girl!

296
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,419
Okay, first of all, breathe.

297
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,006
Second of all, I don't get it.

298
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,467
Aren't you the one that decided
you didn't want to be with Ross?

299
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,679
Yes.

300
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,641
Well, isn't he your friend?
Don't you want him to be happy?

301
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,020
Yes.

302
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,022
So?

303
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:34,780
It's just, you know, I didn't
expect him to be this happy so soon.

304
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,499
-Oh, no.
-What?

305
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,834
We killed them all!

306
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,936
It's not as bad as it looks.
It's a precaution.

307
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,689
I'm not supposed to move my spine.

308
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,069
Please tell me you're stopping now.

309
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,197
I'm fine. I'd fight tonight
if they'd let me.

310
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,493
Now, see this circle
I'm marking off here?

311
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,703
This is my Zone of Terror.

312
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,834
You are insane!
You've got to give this up!

313
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,962
I can't until I'm
the Ultimate Fighter.

314
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,339
I will do it.

315
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,843
The day will come when children will
argue over who will win a fight...

316
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,012
...me or Superman.

317
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,892
Not that I could beat Superman,
but kids are stupid.

318
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,395
Just sit down.

319
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,480
Please listen to me.

320
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:54,693
You are terrible at this, okay? You
are the worst Ultimate Fighter ever.

321
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,112
Ever!

322
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,617
I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline
fracture in my right forearm...

323
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,996
...and a severely bruised Adam's
apple, but that really hurt.

324
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,879
Well, then you know what?

325
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:20,094
I care about you too much to watch you
hurt yourself like this.

326
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,014
So if you have to do this,
you'll have to do it without me.

327
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,434
If you're asking me to quit...

328
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,520
...then you're asking me
to be someone I'm not.

329
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,272
I've got to do this.

330
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,445
Then I've gotta go.

331
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,239
Bye.

332
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,830
-Monica?
-Yes?

333
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,666
Could you leave a note?
I'm on painkillers...

334
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,085
...and I might not
remember this tomorrow.

335
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:03,554
So, in conclusion, the lines
all go up, so I'm happy.

336
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,765
Great job, team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.

337
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,436
Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!

338
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,855
Goldberg, you maniac!

339
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,690
I love you!

340
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,696
-Bing, couldn't have done it without you.
-Thank you, sir.

341
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,281
Oh, excuse me.

342
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,202
I forgot my briefcase, you know,
by accident.

343
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,662
Of course you did. Forgot
something else too, you bastard!

344
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,793
Well, what about you?

345
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,546
You're not feeling left out, are you?

346
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,714
No. Heh.

347
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,467
No, not at all. That's ridiculous.

348
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,887
Everybody else got one,
and you want one too. Don't you?

349
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,558
-Yes, I do.
-Ha-ha-ha.

350
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,977
Now, get on out of here, you!

351
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,818
<i>Pete Becker circles the ring.</i>

352
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,529
<i>Looks like he's just trying
to feel him out.</i>

353
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,239
<i>Bruiser is charging!</i>

354
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,158
Run, you crazy, rich freak!

355
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,078
I can't watch this.

356
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,996
Check it out! Pete's winning!

357
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,249
-Really?
-No!

358
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:20,172
<i>Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on
the canvas and is going for his favorite area!</i>

359
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,674
Oh! Oh!

360
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:25,928
Wait! If that's his favorite area,
why is he being so mean to it?

361
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,846
This is ironic.

362
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,766
Your last boyfriend, Richard,
didn't want to have kids.

363
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,602
And from the looks of it,
now Pete can't.
