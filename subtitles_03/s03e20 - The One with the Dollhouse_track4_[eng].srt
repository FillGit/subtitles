1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,713
Wait a minute.
You're telling me this actress person...

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,883
...is the only woman you ever wanted
who didn't want you back?

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,510
Yeah.

4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,261
Oh, my God.

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,931
Is this what it's like to be you?

6
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,268
-Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
-Oh. You have no idea.

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:22,481
And when we're on-stage,
I get to kiss her and touch her.

8
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,441
But then she goes home
with the director...

9
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,485
...and it's like somebody's
ripping out my heart.

10
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:30,364
Oh, it's so great to see you
feeling like this.

11
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,909
-Hey.
-Hey.

12
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:36,286
Monica, uh, Dad called this morning...

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,332
...and, uh, Aunt Sylvia passed away.

14
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,336
Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,841
We were all pretty shaken up about it.

16
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,468
Wait, am I missing something?

17
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,388
Because I always thought death
was supposed to be sad, in a way.

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,558
Well, uh, Aunt Sylvia was...

19
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,142
...well, not a nice person.

20
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,313
No, she was a cruel, cranky old bitch.

21
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,649
And I'm sorry she died.

22
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,568
Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,947
-You get the dollhouse.
-I get the dollhouse.

24
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,910
Wow. A house for dolls. That is so cool.

25
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,205
When I was a kid, I had a barrel.

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,500
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel
for a dollhouse?

27
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,086
No, just a barrel.

28
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,381
You know what?
You can play with my dollhouse.

29
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,842
-Really? Really?
-Any time you want.

30
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,220
When I was younger, all I wanted to do
was to play with this dollhouse.

31
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,765
But no. It was to be looked at,
but never played with.

32
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,393
My grandmother used to say
that exact same thing to me.

33
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,030
-Hey, Sophie.
-Hey, Rach.

34
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,239
Hey.

35
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,825
Thanks for lunch, Chandler.
You didn't have to walk me here.

36
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,912
Oh, that's okay. No problem.

37
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,168
Honey, you do realize we don't keep
the women's lingerie here in the office.

38
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,714
Yes, I realize that.

39
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,884
-Summer catalog.
-That's the stuff.

40
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,471
Rachel, I need the Versace invoice.

41
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,391
Hello. You don't work for me.

42
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,644
Joanna, this is my friend
Chandler Bing. Joanna.

43
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,521
Bing? Heh. That's a great name.

44
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,440
Thanks, it's Gaelic for,
"Thy turkey's done."

45
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,154
-So, uh, I'm gonna go. Nice meeting you.
-You too.

46
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,864
Bye, Chandler.

47
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,119
So, uh, what's wrong with him?

48
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:26,915
Oh, nothing. He's just goofy like that.
I actually hardly notice it anymore.

49
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,462
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, is he, urn, married
or involved with anyone?

50
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,800
No, no. He's not married or involved
with anyone.

51
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,886
Oh, Rachel....

52
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,930
Actually, you know what? Forget it.

53
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,559
-I'll ask him for you if you want me to.
-Would you?

54
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,352
Or is it just too sad and desperate...

55
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,604
...you know,
something that Sophie would do?

56
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,107
-I am here.
-I know that.

57
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,778
Look at it.

58
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,238
Oh.

59
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,782
Wallpaper's a little faded.
That's okay.

60
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,325
Carpet's a little loose.

61
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,994
Hardwood floors?

62
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,665
-Hey. Oh!
-Hello.

63
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,333
Oh, Monica.

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,837
-It's so beautiful.
-I know.

65
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,632
-So I'm here, ready to play. Hee-hee.
-Okay.

66
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,262
I brought a bunch of stuff
for the house, so check it out. Ha, ha.

67
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,058
What's this?

68
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,561
That's a dog.
Every house should have a dog.

69
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,022
Not one that can pee on the roof.

70
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:39,404
Well, maybe it's so big because the house
was built on radioactive waste.

71
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:45,035
And is this in case the house sneezes?

72
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,123
No. No, that's the ghost for the attic.

73
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,045
-I don't want a ghost.
-Well, nobody wants a ghost.

74
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,881
But you've got one...

75
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:02,344
...because the house is sitting on
an ancient Indian burial ground.

76
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,265
Wait a minute. The house
was built on radioactive waste...

77
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,060
...and an ancient Indian burial ground?

78
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,395
Ha, ha. That would never happen.

79
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,901
Okay, obviously you don't know much
about the U.S. government. Ha, ha.

80
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,404
-Hey.
-Hey.

81
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,574
-I need to talk to you.
-Sure. What's up?

82
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,244
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.

83
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,205
Hen. I know.

84
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,918
Well, if something comes up....

85
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,758
Well, I'm glad you guys are past
that little awkward phase.

86
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:46,513
Okay. My boss, Joanna. When you left...

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,598
...she started asking questions
about you.

88
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,017
Ha, ha. Liked what she saw, huh?

89
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,438
Dug my action, did she?

90
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,692
Checking out the Chan Chan Man.

91
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,905
That was...

92
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,116
...surreal.

93
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,451
Okay, what do you think?
You interested at all?

94
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:13,081
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive.
I'll do it.

95
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:16,835
Oh, thank you, Chandler.
This is great. She's gonna love me.

96
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:21,089
Okay, dinosaur attack.
Quick, everybody into the house. Aah!

97
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,303
All right, Phoebe, you know what?
That's it. That's it. All right?

98
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,764
No dinosaurs, no ghosts,
no giant dogs, okay?

99
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,768
They're not the right size, they're
not Victorian, and they just don't go.

100
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,396
Okay.

101
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,189
Fine.

102
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:43,111
Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome
in the house of no imagination.

103
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,822
Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering
around the subject...

104
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:51,077
...I just have to say that dinosaurs,
they don't go, "Ruff."

105
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,623
The little ones do.

106
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,424
-Hey, Kate.
-Morning.

107
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,093
Listen, I, uh, went to that restaurant
you talked about-

108
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,637
Hey, lovely.

109
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,014
Come, talk to me for a minute.

110
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,934
And I ate the food. It was good.
I had the fish.

111
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,061
Yeah, it was pretty good. Yeah.

112
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,687
Hi.

113
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,606
I'm Lauren. Kate's understudy.

114
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,691
Oh. Hey. Joey Tribbiani.

115
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,527
I know. I'm a big fan of yours.

116
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,780
What?

117
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,868
I used to, um, schedule my classes
so I could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray...

118
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,745
...on <i>Days of our Lives.</i>

119
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,246
Get out of here. Really?

120
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,748
-Absolutely.
-Huh.

121
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,126
Oh, but then they went and dropped you
down that elevator shaft.

122
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,045
Yeah, they gave me the shaft, all right.

123
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,840
You're so funny.

124
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,134
Listen, urn, what are you doing
after rehearsal?

125
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,679
Do you wanna get a drink or something?

126
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,514
Well, uh....

127
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,895
Yeah. Yeah, sure. A drink sounds great.

128
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,399
-Cool. I'll see you then.
-Okay. All right.

129
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:10,073
All right. It's time to act,
my talking props.

130
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,454
-Hey.
-Hey.

131
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,790
Look, everybody.
Look at my new dollhouse.

132
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,417
Wow.

133
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,005
Ha, ha. Look, look.

134
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,927
Hey, what's this?

135
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,055
Oh, okay. It's a slide instead of stairs.
Look.

136
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,265
Oh!

137
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,934
Very interesting, Phoebe.

138
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,895
What's this?

139
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,441
The licorice room.
You can eat all the furniture.

140
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,447
And when guests come over, they can
stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.

141
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,033
This is the coolest house ever.

142
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,163
Hey. Does anyone want to join me
in the Aroma Room?

143
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,665
-All right.
-I would.

144
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,500
Hey, guys? Guys.

145
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,878
Did you see my new china cabinet?

146
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,337
Uh-huh.

147
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,299
Watch. Watch.

148
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,802
-Ooh.
-And? And?

149
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,934
Hey, my father's house does that.

150
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,938
Okay, how did it go?
Tell me everything.

151
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,482
Well, the movie was great...

152
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:30,278
...dinner was great, and there's nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening.

153
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:34,491
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that
because Joanna's such a big dull dud.

154
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,661
Chandler is fantastic.

155
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,831
-What?
-Oh, God. You know how people just click?

156
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:46,294
Like, he came by to pick me up. I opened
the door, and it was just like, "click."

157
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,962
-Did he tell you?
-Well--

158
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,924
Oh, and he's got such a good heart.
Doesn't he have a good heart?

159
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,675
Oh, I know. And he's so sweet.

160
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,011
He said he'd call,
so put him straight through.

161
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,264
-Isn't this great?
-Don't spoil it.

162
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,811
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?

163
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,354
What do you say?

164
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,482
Hello? Oh!

165
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,819
It's you. Just, uh- Just one sec.

166
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,655
I am going to take this call.

167
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,118
When I continue,
I hope that there will appear on-stage...

168
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:22,747
...this magical thing
that in the theater we call...

169
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,959
...committing to the moment.

170
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,507
The guy's like a cartoon.

171
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,218
What do you see in him, anyway?

172
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,220
He happens to be brilliant.

173
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,223
Which is more than I can say
for that sweater you're dating.

174
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,227
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater.

175
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,646
It's what's underneath her sweater
that counts.

176
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,734
And besides, since, uh....

177
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,736
Since when do you care
who I'm going out with?

178
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,906
I don't care.
Why? Do you want me to care?

179
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,410
Heh. Do you want me
to want you to care?

180
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,662
Do you?

181
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,330
What?

182
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:09,210
Okay. I'm afraid to say this,
but let's pick it up where we left off.

183
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,929
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
What do you say?

184
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,640
I've got no reason to stay.

185
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,477
Stop.

186
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:30,273
Stop it. You must stop.

187
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,986
You are bad actors.

188
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,614
This is a terrible play.

189
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,991
I'll see you in the morning.

190
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,622
I can't believe we go on in a week.

191
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,958
-Hey, it's gonna be all right.
-Hey.

192
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,420
So since we're getting off early,
do you want to go and paint mugs?

193
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,799
What?

194
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,594
You know, at that place I told you about
last night?

195
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,973
Oh, yeah, with the mug-painting. Yeah.

196
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,768
-I was so listening to that.
-Ha, ha.

197
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,480
But, uh, you know what?
I think I need to work on my stuff tonight.

198
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,482
-Oh, okay.
-Okay.

199
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,275
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

200
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,782
-Okay. Ha, ha.
-Night.

201
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,247
Uh, are you okay?

202
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,958
Yeah, I guess.

203
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,003
Like, what are we gonna do
about the scene, huh?

204
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,505
I don't know.

205
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,049
Well, urn....

206
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,011
Maybe if it had more heat.

207
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,347
Well, how do you mean?

208
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:48,393
Well, Adrianne's looking for a reason
to stay, right?

209
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,688
Victor can't just kiss her. He's gotta....

210
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,232
He's gotta really give her a reason,
you know?

211
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,235
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.

212
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,951
Or maybe....

213
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:09,038
Maybe he could grab her and lift her up.

214
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,875
Yeah, yeah. Then Adrianne, maybe
she could wrap her legs around his waist.

215
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:17,296
And then she could rip off his shirt
and kiss his chest and his stomach.

216
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,634
And then he could use his teeth, his teeth,
to undo her dress and....

217
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,553
And bite her.

218
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,556
And then right when the scene ends,
he could take her...

219
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:30,268
...with this raw, animal....

220
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,025
Something like that?

221
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,152
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I had in mind.

222
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,862
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

223
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,003
-Hi.
-Hey.

224
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,719
It's a little early to be drinking.

225
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,265
Things, uh, finally happened with Kate.

226
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,809
-Oh. That's great.
-You're kidding. That's great.

227
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,644
Oh, it was so amazing.

228
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,064
After the lovemaking-

229
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,482
Oh, my.

230
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,861
—I just watched her sleep for, like, hours.

231
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,946
-Just breathing in...
-Huh.

232
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,948
...and breathing out.

233
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,787
And I knew she was dreaming
because her eyes kept going like this:

234
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,253
I'm telling you,
Joanna's got it all wrong, okay?

235
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,924
All I said was, "This was fun.
Let's do it again sometime.

236
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,425
I'll give you a call."

237
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,135
Oh, gee....

238
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,222
I wonder why she thinks
you're going to call her?

239
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,891
That's what you say at the end of a date.

240
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,894
You can't just say,
"Nice to meet you. Good night"?

241
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,729
To her face?

242
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,650
It's the end of the date,
I'm standing there...

243
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,985
...she's waiting for me to say
I'll call her...

244
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,530
...and it just, you know, comes out.
I can't help it.

245
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,739
It's a compulsion.

246
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,576
Come on, Rach,
when a guy says he's gonna call...

247
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,246
...it doesn't mean he's going to call.

248
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,540
This never happened to you?

249
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,708
Well, they always called.

250
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,420
Bite me.

251
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,011
-Did he call?
-No, sorry.

252
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,390
Why? Why? He said he'd call.
Why hasn't he called?

253
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:36,644
Maybe he's intimidated by really smart,
strong, successful women.

254
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,856
Sophie, will you please
climb out of my butt.

255
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,527
-Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
-Okay, okay.

256
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:49,657
Um, well, uh, maybe he feels awkward
because you are my boss.

257
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,493
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?

258
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,537
The only person that should
feel awkward is you.

259
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,205
You didn't tell him not to call me?

260
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,208
If you're uncomfortable with your friend
dating someone you work for...

261
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,586
...there are always ways to fix that.

262
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,754
Uh....

263
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,508
Call her. Call her now.

264
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,137
Multiple, so many paper cuts.

265
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,223
"Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why? Why?

266
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,309
I don't understand. He said he'd call."

267
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,896
Chandler, I'm telling you, she's flipped out.
She's gone crazy.

268
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,357
Oh. Well, give me the phone, then.

269
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,235
This isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault
you haven't called her.

270
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,403
You have to call her.

271
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,364
Look, you can't call somebody
after this long just to say:

272
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,701
"In case you didn't notice,
I don't like you."

273
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,870
Then you're gonna have to
take her out again.

274
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,956
No. She's really dull,
and she gets this...

275
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:43,211
...gross mascara-goop thing
in the corner of her eye.

276
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,880
I don't care. I don't care.

277
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,924
You'll take her out again and end it...

278
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,593
...and end it in a way
that she knows it's actually ended.

279
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,555
And I don't care how hard it is for you.
Do not tell her you'll call her again.

280
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,057
All right, fine.

281
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,352
But it's just a lunch date.
From now on, I get my own dates.

282
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,729
I don't want you setting me up
with anybody again.

283
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,481
That's fine.

284
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,859
-That's just a lot of big talk, you know.
-I know.

285
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,863
Mon?

286
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,740
I'm in the shower.

287
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,297
Aah! Fire. There's a fire. Fire.

288
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,037
-Hey.
-Hi.

289
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,711
So I, uh, talked to Lauren.
I kind of told her how things were with us.

290
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,587
Did you, uh-? Did you talk to Marshall?

291
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:10,756
About what?

292
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,427
Ha, ha. You know,
about what happened with us.

293
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:16,762
No.

294
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,473
And there's really no reason
why he should find out.

295
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,519
So, uh, let's not make a big deal
out of it, okay?

296
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,315
What are you talking about?

297
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,775
It was a big deal.

298
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:34,196
I mean, come on, you can't tell me
last night didn't mean something to you.

299
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,615
I was there.
You're not that good an actress.

300
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,908
Look.

301
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,330
Um, I was-
I was just caught up in the moment.

302
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,082
That's all it was.

303
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,961
Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad...

304
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,965
...but haven't you ever slept with a woman
where it meant more to her than to you?

305
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,634
No.

306
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,804
-Hi, Kate.
-Hi, Lauren.

307
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,223
Hi, Lauren.

308
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,059
Hi, pig.

309
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,440
Sorry I, uh- I scared you in there.

310
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,233
Oh, that's okay.

311
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,319
By the way...

312
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,614
...I was just checking
the shower massager.

313
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,948
Yeah.

314
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,035
Hey.

315
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,120
I tried to reach you at work.

316
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,539
There's been a fire.

317
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,626
What? Oh, my- Oh, my God.

318
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,212
What happened?

319
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,882
Well, we believe it originated here...

320
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,052
...in the Aroma Room.

321
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,721
All right, did everyone get out okay?

322
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,558
Well, the giraffe's okay
and so is the pirate.

323
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,560
-What is this?
-No, Phoebe, don't look.

324
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,771
You don't want to see
what's under there.

325
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,734
The foster puppets.

326
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,031
It's not a big deal.

327
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,701
It's just- It's right here,
and it's all the time.

328
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,873
Well, thanks again for lunch.

329
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:14,422
-Yes, this was pleasant.
-It was, wasn't it?

330
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,509
-The food there was great.
-Wasn't it?

331
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,513
So take care.

332
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,640
You too.

333
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,227
This was great. I'll give you a call.
We should do it again.

334
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,147
Great. I'm looking forward to it.

335
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,942
-Rachel, any messages?
-Sophie's desk.

336
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,947
Chandler. Are you gonna call her?

337
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,824
-No.
-Chandler.

338
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,578
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm weak and pathetic and sorry.

339
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,122
Okay, you are gonna tell her.
You're gonna tell her now.

340
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,499
Ow, I'm not gonna call you.

341
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,587
What?

342
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,298
I'm sorry.

343
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,302
I'm sorry that I said I was going to
when I'm not.

344
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,305
Ugh. Look, this has nothing
to do with you.

345
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,932
And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me.

346
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,352
I have serious, serious problems
when it comes to women.

347
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:15,191
I have issues with commitment,
intimacy...

348
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,693
...mascara goop.

349
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:25,284
And I'm really sorry. It's just that
this is not- This isn't gonna work out.

350
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,707
Well, this isn't how I was hoping
this would end...

351
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,211
...but I guess I have to appreciate
your honesty.

352
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,630
Yeah, okay.

353
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,382
So....

354
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,305
Well, this is great. I'll give you a call.
We should do it again sometime.

355
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,980
Wha- So anyway, Beth,
what I'm saying is...

356
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:59,527
...I should have considered your feelings
before I went home with you that night.

357
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,237
I've, uh....

358
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,406
I've recently learned what it's like
to be on your side of it...

359
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,742
...and I'm sorry.

360
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,538
So do you think you can forgive me?

361
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,749
Great. Thanks.

362
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,085
Okay. Bye.

363
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,754
Whoo.

364
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,678
Hello, Jennifer?

365
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,597
Oh, hi, Mrs. Laurio. Is Jennifer there?

366
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,724
Oh, she's not home, huh?

367
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:35,813
Well, uh, actually I kind of need
to talk to you too.
