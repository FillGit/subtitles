1
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,051
What's so funny?

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,347
Oh, nothing. It's an acting exercise.
I'm practicing my fake laugh.

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,265
Oh.

4
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,395
What? What's so funny?

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,066
Oh, no, no.

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,610
No, no. There's none of that in here.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,113
Oh, come on.
At least let me finish this last one.

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,075
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.

9
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,786
Okay.

10
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,128
Oh, dark mother, once again
I suckle at your smoky teat.

11
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,384
Why don't you hold on to that one.

12
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,938
That's, like, the least fun game ever.

13
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:06,024
I'm sick of your smoking,
so I brought something...

14
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,527
...that is going to help you quit.

15
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,153
Oh.

16
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,994
That patch is no good.

17
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,916
It's a hypnosis tape.

18
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,878
A woman at work used it for two weeks
and hasn't smoked since.

19
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,463
Ha!

20
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,425
What's your problem?

21
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:35,512
Nothing. It's just that
hypnosis is beyond crap.

22
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,516
I watched you get hypnotized
in Atlantic City.

23
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,185
That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?

24
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:46,356
You always pull your pants down
and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.

25
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,609
Forget hypnosis.

26
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,572
The way to quit smoking is
to dance naked in a field of heather...

27
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,908
...and then bathe in the sweat
of six healthy young men.

28
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,246
Or what my father calls
"Thursday night."

29
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,507
-Here you go.
-I didn't want cinnamon on this.

30
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,133
Sorry.

31
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,143
-Hi. Hi.
-Oh, my God! Frank!

32
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,854
Ha, ha. Hi. How are you?

33
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,773
What are you doing here?

34
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,651
I would've called,
but I lost your number.

35
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,780
And then, uh, my mom locked me out
of the house, so I couldn't find it.

36
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:21,952
And, uh, then I tried to find a pay phone,
and the receiver was cut off.

37
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,705
What happened?

38
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,833
Uh, oh. Vandalism.

39
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,795
But also, what happened
between you and your mom?

40
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:36,508
We got in a fight. She said that
I was too immature to get married.

41
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,052
-You're getting married?
-Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,846
Aah!

43
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,641
My little brother's getting married! Ha, ha.

44
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:49,062
I knew you'd be so cool about this.
Uh, hey, do you wanna meet her?

45
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,480
Do I?

46
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,149
Do you?

47
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,192
Yeah, I do.

48
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,779
Cool, all right.
She's just parking the truck.

49
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,658
I'm gonna- I'm gonna go get
my, uh, fiancee, man!

50
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,790
I'd have bet good money that he'd be
the first one of us to get married.

51
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,792
Isn't it fantastic?

52
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,254
Yeah, but don't you think he's
a little young to get married?

53
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,174
-What? He's 18.
-It'll be illegal for him to drink...

54
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,134
...at his own bachelor party.

55
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,179
Yeah, or to get a hooker.

56
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,223
Always illegal, Joe.

57
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,350
Hey! Hey!

58
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,312
This is, uh, my fiancee...

59
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,481
-...Mrs. Knight.
-Ha-ha-ha.

60
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,319
-That's my sister.
-You know, it's funny.

61
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:41,698
Frank told me so much about you,
but you're not how I pictured you at all.

62
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,701
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.

63
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,996
-Here you go. Here, grab a seat.
-Oh.

64
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,707
So how did you guys meet?

65
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,585
Well, um, I was in Mrs. Knight's....

66
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,756
I mean, Alice. Sorry.
I always do that. Ha, ha.

67
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,760
I was in her Home Ec class.

68
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,428
He was my best student.

69
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,597
She was my best teacher.

70
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,224
A ww.

71
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,360
If that doesn't keep kids in school,
what will?

72
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,406
And so now you guys
are gonna be married?

73
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,741
Yeah. Ha, ha.

74
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,912
We talked about just living together,
but, um...

75
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,123
...we wanna have kids right away.

76
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,378
Oh, my God!

77
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,463
Great!

78
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,176
Wow, kids. Frank,
are you sure you're ready for that?

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,303
How hard can it be?

80
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,808
You know, I mean, you know, babies.
Who doesn't want babies? Right?

81
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,436
And besides,
I never had a dad around.

82
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:57,107
And now I always will,
because it'll be me.

83
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,990
Really, we do realize that there's
an age difference between us.

84
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,826
Good. Because you were
acting like you didn't.

85
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,329
But when it comes to love,
what does age matter?

86
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,548
<i>You are falling fast asleep.</i>

87
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,759
<i>Deeper, deeper, deeper.</i>

88
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,387
<i>You are now completely asleep.</i>

89
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,889
<i>You don't need to smoke.</i>

90
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,642
<i>Cigarettes don't control you.</i>

91
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,895
<i>You are a strong, confident woman...</i>

92
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,899
<i>...who does not need to smoke.</i>

93
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,319
<i>A strong, confident woman.</i>

94
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:49,326
You know what? I realized in the last year
I've only gone out with Richard and Julio.

95
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,121
You gotta help me out. Set me up.
Get me back in the game.

96
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:57,375
Shouldn't be a problem. I work in fashion,
and all I meet are eligible straight men.

97
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,714
Can I get you something else?

98
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,759
Cheesecake and a date,
if you're giving them out.

99
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,219
Heh. Haven't we covered that topic?

100
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,932
-You just said to her-
-You wanna go out with me...

101
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,477
...because of my wig, the big boobs,
and I serve you food.

102
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,229
If that were true,
I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.

103
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,317
And the two times we went out,
it was plain awkward.

104
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,112
You think she should go out with me,
don't you?

105
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,489
Ha, ha.

106
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,575
Well, I mean...

107
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,869
...are you sure
you wanna go out with her?

108
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,581
That ain't a pretty picture
in the morning, know what I mean?

109
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:40,794
That wig all in disarray,
and boobs flung over the nightstand.

110
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,755
Really. Think about it.

111
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,633
Oh, I will. Ha-ha-ha.

112
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,179
No, I know.
I know that this is Frank's life.

113
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,764
You know?

114
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:56,393
I don't wanna be judgmental,
but it's sick. It's sick and wrong!

115
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,771
What, is it the age thing?

116
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,731
No, I'm fine with the age thing...

117
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,734
...until it sticks its tongue
down my brother's throat.

118
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,905
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.

119
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,243
You think he'll enjoy it
when he's up to his elbows in diapers...

120
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,495
...of all the babies
they have to have right away?

121
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:21,292
This is not fair to Frank,
and it's not fair to the babies.

122
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,129
You know what?
It's not good home economics.

123
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,800
Have you told him how you feel?

124
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,678
Yes. Not out loud.

125
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,933
If you don't tell him, soon he'll be
married, then you'll hate yourself.

126
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,770
Yeah, but if I do tell him,
then he's gonna hate myself.

127
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,274
Look at him and his mom.
I can't.

128
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,778
But you guys can.
You talk him out of it.

129
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,864
No, no, no, no, no, no.

130
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,949
Come on, you guys.

131
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,537
You have nothing to lose.
I have everything to lose.

132
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,165
Do you want me to lose everything?
Everything?

133
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,711
No.

134
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,505
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.

135
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,470
We're walking down the street,
and I turn to you and say:

136
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,931
"Let's go hang out at
Totally Nude Nudes." Remember?

137
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,727
And then, heh, you say,
"Let's just hang out at your place."

138
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,354
Well, that was a nice move, dumb-ass.

139
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,358
I think you should
go out with this guy.

140
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,402
No, he doesn't do anything for me.

141
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,907
Last Saturday night, what happened
on <i>Walker, Texas Ranger?</i>

142
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,787
Well, um, Walker was looking
for this big busload of kids. Heh.

143
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,997
All right, I get your point.

144
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,541
-Hey.
-Hey.

145
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,711
I forgot the combination to this
about a year ago.

146
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,005
I just carry it around.

147
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,134
-You got any Chap Stick?
-Uh, yeah.

148
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,011
Hey, how are those tapes working out?

149
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,639
Pretty good. Good.
I haven't smoked yet today.

150
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:02,268
I feel great and confident.
That is a stunning blouse.

151
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,190
Thank you.

152
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,025
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

153
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:14,155
Okay, Mon. Let's give Pete a chance.
He was funny. He seems really nice.

154
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,241
That check thing was adorable.

155
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,076
What check thing?

156
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:23,456
As a joke, this customer who has a
crush on me, gave me a $20,000 tip.

157
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,376
His number's on the check.
He did it so I'd call.

158
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,878
Pete Becker. Pete-

159
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,636
Is this him?

160
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,429
That's Bill Clinton.

161
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,559
Who's he hugging?

162
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,939
Oh, my God. That's Pete.
Why is Bill hugging Pete?

163
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,899
This guy invented Moss 865.

164
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,527
Every office in the world
uses that program.

165
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,238
-We use it!
-There you go!

166
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,825
Oh, my God. Monica's gonna go out
with a millionaire.

167
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,494
-No, I'm not gonna go out with him.
-Oh, my God.

168
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,582
I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check.
This is so exciting.

169
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,001
Or incredibly offensive.

170
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,627
Yeah, sure. That too.

171
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,100
What?

172
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,563
All we're saying is,
don't rush into anything.

173
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,109
Come on, think about it.
You're 18, okay? She's 44.

174
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,738
When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.

175
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,241
You don't think I know that?

176
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,288
Look, the point is...

177
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,458
...there's a lot of women
you haven't had sex with yet.

178
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,420
Yeah, he's right. He's right.
This is your time, you know?

179
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:56,507
You're young. You're weird.
Chicks dig that.

180
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:01,054
But isn't sex better when it's with
one person that you really care about?

181
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,640
Yeah, in a poem, maybe.

182
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,227
No, the man's right.
That's what I had with Rachel.

183
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,771
You don't have it anymore?

184
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:14,108
No, I, uh- I slept with someone else.

185
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,445
So wait. So how did that
make things better?

186
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,490
It didn't.

187
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,536
What you used to have with Rachel
is what I got with Alice.

188
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,413
Now what is that like?

189
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,790
It's so cool, man.

190
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:33,544
It's because being with her is so
much better than not being with her.

191
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,129
Yeah. Yeah.

192
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,299
-Why can't I find that?
-I had it and I blew it.

193
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,052
-Well, I want it!
-You can have it.

194
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,763
Maybe I can't.
Maybe there's something wrong with me.

195
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,226
No, it's out there, man.
I've seen it! I got it!

196
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,521
-Then you hold on to it!
-All right, man!

197
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,524
All right! Congratulations,
you lucky bastard!

198
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,818
You're Frank's best man?

199
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,948
I couldn't help it.
Their love is so pure.

200
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,159
What about you, huh?

201
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,120
I'm the ring bearer.

202
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,389
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi. Thanks.

203
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:30,184
I'm so glad you could come.
I've got a real, urn, Home Ec emergency.

204
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,521
-Oh, my God. Who died on this?
-Yeah, I know.

205
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,523
It's a real "mustard-tastrophe."

206
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,319
-Can you help me?
-Absolutely.

207
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,447
Okay, first, we'll start
with a little club soda and salt.

208
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,742
-Then if that doesn't work-
-You know what? Forget it. It's ruined.

209
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,620
Oh, no, never say that. If you can't
get it out, cut around the stain...

210
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,457
...add a little lace,
you make a stylish throw.

211
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,545
Or instead, maybe you could just
not marry my brother, Frank?

212
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,470
Can we make it smaller?
Make it fit on the head of a pin?

213
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,930
I love when we make things
fit on the head of a pin.

214
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,307
<i>-Got it, yeah.
-Yeah, okay.</i>

215
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,685
<i>You have Monica Geller here.</i>

216
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,772
Uh, absolutely. Yeah, send her in.

217
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,565
Hi.

218
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,276
What the hell is this?

219
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,363
Hang on for a sec.
I'll talk to you in the morning?

220
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,572
<i>You got it.</i>

221
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,826
-I'm sorry. What?
-What's this supposed to mean?

222
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,246
Well, you know,
I never know how much to tip.

223
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,376
You double the tax.
Not double the tax of Romania.

224
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,130
I mean, what's the deal?
Are you trying to buy me?

225
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,383
Is this the way you get girls
to go out with you?

226
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,802
<i>Uh, I'm still here.</i>

227
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,141
You're taking this wrong.
If I didn't leave you that tip...

228
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,478
...you wouldn't have come,
we wouldn't have this argument...

229
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,980
...and there wouldn't be this,
uh, heat between us.

230
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,816
-What?
-Come on.

231
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,820
You gotta admit that our relationship
is hitting a new level now.

232
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,489
You were the chef,
and I was the customer.

233
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,908
But now we're this couple that fights.

234
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,494
Okay, um...

235
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,954
...you're a loon.

236
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,917
Look, forget the check, okay?
I like you.

237
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,128
I think you're great.

238
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,421
Come on, what do you say?

239
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,342
I don't know.

240
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,844
Why not?

241
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,305
I don't wanna encourage this behavior.

242
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,352
One meal.
That's all I'm asking for. Please?

243
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,479
We go out, we eat.

244
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,275
If you don't have a good time,
I'll give you 10 grand, we're even.

245
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,079
-Hi.
-Aah! No!

246
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,249
Wait, no. Just put the mail down.
It's me.

247
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,837
Sorry. Why were you just all in the dark?

248
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:08,176
Well, um, your laundry smelled so good
that I thought I'd curl up in it.

249
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,386
-Is that all right?
-Yeah, sure.

250
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,180
So how was your day?

251
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:16,142
It's just probably the worst one
since I've been alive.

252
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,396
What, urn-? What happened?

253
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,773
Um, Alice, uh....

254
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,193
She, uh, called it off.

255
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,903
Oh, no.

256
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,574
Did, um- Did she say why?

257
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,577
Uh, no, not really.
Just that I was too young.

258
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,580
I don't see how I could
suddenly be too young...

259
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,209
...because I'm older than I was
when we first got together.

260
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,213
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't-

261
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:50,218
I don't know. But you know what?
Maybe it's just all for the best.

262
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,971
Well, yeah, if the best is
like unbelievable pain.

263
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,265
Oh, sweetie.

264
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,727
You know, I was just finally happy.

265
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,605
For the first time in my life...

266
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,233
...after my dad left me...

267
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:10,571
...and then getting arrested
for stealing those birds...

268
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,534
...and then the whole
punctured-lung thing.

269
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,330
It's still really hard to take
deep breaths in cold weather...

270
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,459
...but with Alice,
all that stuff kind of went away.

271
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:29,131
And now it's gone,
and I don't know why.

272
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,096
Ugh. Well, I can tell you why.
It's because of me.

273
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,475
But you know what? I only did it
because I love you, okay?

274
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:46,357
-What?
-Um, I kind of had a little chat with Alice...

275
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,735
...and I sort of made her see
why you two shouldn't be together.

276
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,239
And you'll see it too, one day.
You really, really will.

277
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,950
Wait a minute.
This is because of you?

278
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,159
Okay....

279
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,496
Wait, no. My mother didn't want us
to be together...

280
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,582
...but the worst thing she did
was tie me to the porch.

281
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,793
Okay, but-

282
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,547
I came to you because
I thought you'd understand.

283
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,008
Oh, no!

284
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,468
No- Ugh.

285
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,804
I would storm out of here...

286
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:20,808
...if I had some money
or a place to go.

287
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,025
Oh, my God! The millionaire's here!

288
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,235
Oh, my God!

289
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,534
Guys, please.
I'm just gonna have dinner with him.

290
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:43,497
Okay, just because he buys you dinner
does not mean you owe him anything.

291
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,125
I know.

292
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,962
Okay, then get the lobster.

293
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,842
-Hey.
-Hi.

294
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,218
-Hi.
-Hey.

295
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,595
Hello.

296
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,015
Hey, how much cash you got
in your pocket right now?

297
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,605
And that's why I'm not
inviting you in for a drink. Bye.

298
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,815
Why not? Hey, come in for drink.

299
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,402
-Where do you wanna go?
-You like pizza?

300
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,031
-Oh, that sounds great.
-I know a great little place.

301
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,247
You're not paying for the pizza.

302
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,959
Come on, it's only fair.
You paid for the flight.

303
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,711
Is that enough lira?

304
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,214
Uh, I'd throw another 1000 on that.

305
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,300
-How much is that?
-That's about 60 cents.

306
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,939
Every night!

307
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,026
<i>You don't need to smoke.</i>

308
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,696
<i>Cigarettes don't control you.</i>

309
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,533
<i>You are a strong, confident woman...</i>

310
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,494
<i>...who does not need to smoke.</i>

311
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,956
<i>A strong, confident woman...</i>

312
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,334
<i>...who does not need to smoke.</i>

313
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,129
<i>So can I.</i>

314
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,761
Hey, Frank.

315
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,808
Look, I know that you think I did
this totally evil thing.

316
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,435
But I so didn't.

317
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,647
Someone's here who can explain this
better than I can.

318
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,692
<i>We can go look.</i>

319
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,320
Hi, Frank.

320
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,286
Hi, Mrs. Knight.

321
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,790
Phoebe's right, Frank.

322
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,336
It's hard to hear, but it would've
been wrong to go through with it.

323
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,255
I was being selfish.

324
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,301
Even though we want
the same things right now...

325
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,345
...in the future, we may not.

326
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,016
-Is that what it is?
-Yes, but not just that.

327
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,310
Right, not just that.

328
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:17,526
Even though we love each other
as much as we do...

329
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,653
...nonetheless....

330
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,866
-Nonetheless.
-Nonetheless.

331
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,703
Um....

332
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,207
You're too young...

333
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,044
...to really know what you want.

334
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,213
That's right, exactly.

335
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,675
That's a goodbye kiss.
That's good.

336
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,387
Bye-bye.

337
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:50,851
The important thing is,
is that you see what I'm saying.

338
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,729
This is clearly wrong.

339
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,775
I've decided I'm gonna
let this happen.

340
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,861
Okay, can I just get my purse?

341
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,656
-Mmm.
-Okay, all right, good.

342
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,121

345

<i>Joey's your best friend.</i>

346
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:27,555
<i>You wanna make him
a cheese sandwich every day.</i>

347
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:35,062
<i>And you also wanna buy him
hundreds of dollars worth of pants.</i>
