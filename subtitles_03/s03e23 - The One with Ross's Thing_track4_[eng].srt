1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,381
Hey, wouldn't it be cool if our duck
and our chick had a little baby?

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,675
We could call it Chuck.

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,221
Or Dick.

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,682
-Hey.
-Hey.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,393
Listen, I need a favor.

6
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,730
I was in the shower, and as I was...

7
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:25,484
...cleansing myself, I, uh-
Well, I felt something.

8
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,862
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,158
No, no. I mean, like, a thing on my body.

10
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:34,993
Well, what was it?

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,956
Well, I don't know.
It's kind of in a place that's not....

12
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:43,210
It's not visually accessible to me.
And I was hoping maybe you guys...

13
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,628
...could help me out.

14
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,505
-Whoa!
-Whoa! No.

15
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,132
Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,051
Hey, hey, hey.

17
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,470
Huh.

18
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,223
Well, what is it? Is it a mole?

19
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,852
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

20
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,230
Ew. Is it-? What, a pimple?

21
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,151
No, it's...

22
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,654
...fancier than a pimple.

23
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,823
-Look, Ross, just go see a doc-
-Guys, what's-?

24
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,081
Okay, well, it's definite.
Two more weeks of winter.

25
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,624
-Yeah, right.
-Ah.

26
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,388
And, um, this is the coffeehouse.
This is where I play my music.

27
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,557
-Good deal.
-Yeah, and these are my friends.

28
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,976
People? This is Vince.
Vince, the people.

29
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,311
Hi.

30
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,314
-Hey.
-Vince is a fireman.

31
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,942
Wow. Have you ever rescued anyone
from a burning building before?

32
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,570
Ninety-eight hot saves.
Highest on the force.

33
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,739
Well, you know, if Joey and I
play with matches...

34
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,824
...we could get you up to an even 100.

35
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,537
-Fire safety is not a joke, son.
-Ha, ha. Oh.

36
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,708
You're right. I know.

37
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,544
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight.

38
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,671
-See you Saturday.
-Okay.

39
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,675
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs.

40
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,928
But I thought you just started dating
that teacher.

41
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,179
-Oh, Jason?
-Yeah.

42
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,390
Uh-huh. We're seeing each other tonight.
Ahem.

43
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,225
Well, Pheebs?

44
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,061
Two dates in one day?
That's so unlike you.

45
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,731
I know, I know.
I'm, like, playing the field, you know?

46
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,819
I'm juggling two guys.
I'm sowing my wild oats, you know?

47
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:18,281
You know, this kind of, like, you know,
oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

48
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,283
So, Pheebs, do they know
about each other?

49
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,245
Does a dog's lips move
when he reads?

50
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,668
Okay, no, they don't know.

51
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,714
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.

52
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,218
-Well?
-How'd it go at the doctor's?

53
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:42,305
Well, he said there's definitely
nothing to worry about. It's totally benign.

54
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,808
-Well, what is it?
-He couldn't even tell me.

55
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:50,605
He said it was just
some sort of skin abnormality.

56
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,443
And the worse thing is, he said
not being able to identify it...

57
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,361
...he was reluctant to remove it.

58
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,280
You know what?
You should go to my guy.

59
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,866
Because when I went in there
with my third nipple...

60
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,202
-...he just lopped it right off, you know?
-Yeah?

61
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,329
-So I guess I'm lucky.
-Heh.

62
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:10,542
I mean, not as lucky as people
who are born with two nipples.

63
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,880
At least they knew what yours was.
You know? Yours had a name.

64
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,592
Oh. Maybe they'll name yours after you.

65
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,845
You know? They'd call it The Ross.

66
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,557
And then people would be, like,
"Oh, he's got a Ross."

67
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,311
Yeah, that'd be cool.

68
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,939
Pete's breaking up with me.

69
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,274
What?

70
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,359
Yeah, I just checked my messages.

71
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,946
He said that when he gets back
from Atlanta, "We need to talk."

72
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,865
-And?
-Well, that's it.

73
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,410
People never say, "We need to talk,"
unless it's something bad.

74
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,497
Whoa. That doesn't necessarily mean
he's breaking up with you.

75
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,998
-Yeah.
-Really?

76
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,834
Yeah. Maybe he just cheated on you.

77
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,676
And I know I'll never get rich doing it,
but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool...

78
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,387
...knowing you're making
a difference in a kid's life.

79
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,556
That is so great.

80
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,434
-Oh, my God.
-Oh.

81
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,894
-Oh, my God!
-Ooh.

82
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,396
-Uh, we'd better call the fire department.
-No. No.

83
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,566
-No, no?
-Well, we don't need a fireman.

84
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,735
We need, like, a good mechanic.

85
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,240
Oh, my God. Here they come.
We gotta get out of here.

86
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,491
Wait. Why?

87
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,369
Look, if I wanted to see a fireman,
I would date one, okay?

88
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,123
That's all it is, a third nipple.

89
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,919
You know? Just your
run-of-the-mill third nipple. Yeah.

90
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,631
You can take it off.
Just slice that baby right off.

91
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,926
Take your shirt off and let's see
what we're dealing with here.

92
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,305
What are you doing?

93
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,727
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,
slice-it-right-off third nipple.

94
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,730
-Well, that's not a third nipple.
-Oh?

95
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,191
First of all, it's on your ass.

96
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,527
Well, then what is it?

97
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,946
Wait a minute. Hold it.

98
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,118
-Jansen, will you come in here a moment?
-I'm with Hamilton.

99
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,620
He's good with weird things.
Bring him in too.

100
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,458
I gotta go water Pete's plants.

101
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,796
You know what? If he's gonna break up
with me, maybe I won't water his plants.

102
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,883
Well, if he's gonna break up with you,
maybe Joey and I should water his plants...

103
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,805
...if you know what I mean.

104
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,932
Or, ha, ha...

105
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,435
...we could go over there
and pee on them.

106
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,064
I can't take it, you know?

107
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,942
I'm always afraid one of them
is gonna catch me with the other.

108
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,652
It's making me crazy.

109
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,322
Well, honey, why don't you
break up with one of them?

110
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,659
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened to playing the field?

111
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,995
Well, it doesn't feel
like playing anymore.

112
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,332
It's feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field.

113
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,169
-So, Pheebs, pick one of them.
-Yeah, which one do you like more?

114
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,673
Well, Vince is great, you know?
Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

115
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,969
You know?
He's just so burly, so very burly.

116
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,515
Okay, good. So there you go.
Go with Vince.

117
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,517
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.

118
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,021
-Well, sensitive is important. Pick him.
-Yeah.

119
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,982
Oh, sure. Go with the sissy.

120
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,319
Jason is not a sissy.

121
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,696
Oh, no, no, no. I meant Chandler.

122
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,710
You know, I have dinner plans.

123
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,215
Thank you so much for coming
on such a short notice.

124
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:49,469
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been
practicing medicine for 23 years...

125
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,263
...and I'm stumped.

126
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,777
Okay, this is the den.

127
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,488
All right, check this out. Lights.

128
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,075
Whoa. All right, less lights. Bad lights.

129
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,202
Lights, go away.

130
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,206
Aw, see? You just need
to find the right command.

131
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,959
Yes. And the dimmer switch.

132
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,504
Whoa. For a rich guy,
that's a pretty small TV.

133
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,381
No, no, no. That's the videophone.

134
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:30,260
But hey, guys, you're not supposed
to be here, so please don't touch anything.

135
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,722
IKEA, this is comfortable.

136
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,975
This place is amazing.

137
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,811
-Oh, God. That is the nicest kitchen.
-I know.

138
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,521
No, no. It's the nicest kitchen.

139
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,940
The refrigerator told me
to have a great day.

140
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,610
Look at this, a millionaire's checkbook.

141
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,154
Joey, put that down.

142
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,949
Oh, my God, that's Pete. Okay, get out.

143
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,286
-How the hell do you answer a videophone?
<i>-Monica?</i>

144
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,457
I guess that's how.

145
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,250
<i>Hey, Monica, how's it going?</i>

146
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,211
Oh, it's good. It's, urn-- It's good.

147
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,130
Just here, watering the plants.

148
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,466
<i>Well, don't forget that ficus
over there by Rachel.</i>

149
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,553
Ha. Chandler's on the couch.

150
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,308
<i>Yeah, I see him. You guys
are just the worst hiders ever.</i>

151
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,561
-Hi, Pete.
-How you doing?

152
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,313
Uh, Pete, um....

153
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,565
The other day when you said
you needed to talk...

154
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:29,319
...um, just so I know,
is it good news or bad news?

155
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,821
<i>Oh, it's good news.
No, it's definitely good news.</i>

156
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,574
<i>Hold on a second, I have another call.</i>

157
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,159
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

158
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,119
No, no, no, it's still me.

159
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,205
<i>No, it's not.
I've got picture-in-picture here.</i>

160
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,502
<i>Yeah. Yeah, okay.
I'm gonna have to call you back later.</i>

161
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,296
<i>Monica? You.
I'm gonna have to call you back.</i>

162
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,174
Oh. Oh, okay. Um, so I'll see you soon.

163
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,343
<i>-Okay. I love you.
</i>-I love you.

164
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,887
We love you too.

165
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,264
Okay.

166
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,683
Well, it's good news. It's good news.

167
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,062
-So, what do you think the good news is?
-Look at this.

168
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:08,566
He wrote a check for $50,000
to Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design.

169
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,862
Oh. Sorry. Uh, what do you think
the good news is?

170
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,658
Oh, my.

171
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,827
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire.

172
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,705
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone.
Call Mom. Call Mom.

173
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,707
<i>Hello?</i>

174
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,210
And that's Pete's mom. Ha, ha.

175
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,801
No, Mon, you have to make it
a theme wedding.

176
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,511
And the theme could be:

177
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,847
"Look How Much Money We've Got."

178
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,226
You know? I mean, you could put money
in the invitations.

179
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,354
You could have, like,
little-money place settings.

180
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,565
And, uh, you could start
with a money salad.

181
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,402
I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.

182
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,903
Would you stop?

183
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,365
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.
We don't know if he'll propose.

184
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,118
Yes, but this is Pete, okay?
He's not like other people.

185
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,995
On your first date, he took you to Rome.

186
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:06,165
For most guys, that's like
a third or fourth date kind of thing.

187
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,128
Well, if that's what it is, then it's crazy.

188
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,256
Monica's right. We're talking about
getting married here.

189
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,675
Okay? She can't just rush into this.

190
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,220
Oh, what do you know?
You married a lesbian.

191
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,520
All right. I gotta go.
I have to break up with Vince.

192
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,856
Oh. So you're going with the teacher,
huh?

193
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,860
Yeah. I like Vince a lot, you know?
But Jason is so sensitive, you know?

194
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,447
And in the long run, I think
sensitive is better than having...

195
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:41,701
...just, like, a really, really,
really nice body.

196
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,206
Jason. Definitely Jason.

197
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,626
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

198
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,504
Oh, my God.

199
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,637
Sorry. I was just imagining what it'd be like
to catch the money bouquet.

200
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,853
Excuse me. Urn, is Vince here?

201
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,146
Oh, sure.

202
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,606
-Vince.
-Yo.

203
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,820
Wow. I didn't know you guys
actually used those.

204
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,114
So, what's up?

205
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,491
Um....

206
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,117
Wow.

207
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,745
This isn't gonna be easy. Um....

208
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,874
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

209
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,501
Uh-huh.

210
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,504
Good deal.

211
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,674
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

212
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:42,720
It's just that, uh, I thought
we had something pretty special here.

213
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:47,100
An you know, I felt like you were someone
I could finally open up to.

214
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,770
There's so much in me
I haven't shared with you yet.

215
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,983
-Oh, my God. I didn't know you were so-
-I'm sorry. I can't talk.

216
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,987
I'm gonna go write in my journal.

217
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,950
Wait. Wait. Wait.

218
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:10,206
I'm telling you, if you wanna take care
of that thing, go see my herbal guy.

219
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:15,044
Thank you, but I wanna remove it, Pheebs.
I don't wanna make it savory.

220
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,966
You know, when girls sleep with guys
with weird things on their body...

221
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,302
...they tell their friends about it.

222
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,512
Give me that.

223
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,394
Hi. Okay, don't be mad at me,
but I couldn't resist.

224
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,729
Bride's magazines?

225
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,606
Yes, and I know that you said
you'd say no if he asked you...

226
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,943
...but I'm sorry, how great would you look
walking down the aisle...

227
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,237
...in this Donna Karan?

228
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,323
Oh, you so would.

229
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,117
Oh, you should get that anyway.

230
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,871
Well, for clubbing.

231
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,248
It is so weird.

232
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,585
I know what I said. But, um, this morning...

233
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,255
...I was lying in bed, I was imagining
what it'd be like to say yes.

234
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,428
I know it's a little sudden,
and it's rushed...

235
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,181
...and it's totally not like me
to do something like this.

236
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,434
But that doesn't mean I can't. Right?

237
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,394
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

238
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,147
And I know that we want
the same things.

239
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,816
And when I thought
about saying yes...

240
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,818
...it made me really happy.

241
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,779
Oh, my God.

242
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,990
I know.

243
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,867
I need more pie.

244
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,956
Hey, Mon, um, if you do get married,
can I bring two guests?

245
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,961
You didn't break up with that fireman?

246
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,047
No, that was my way of telling you.

247
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,634
Well, it turns out
he's incredibly sensitive.

248
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,053
He keeps a journal and he paints.

249
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,430
He even showed me charcoal drawings
that he drew of me.

250
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,640
Wow.

251
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,852
He'd prefer watercolors, but, you know,
he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.

252
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,357
So then are you gonna dump Jason?

253
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,819
Well, yeah, because I have to break up
with someone and....

254
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,989
Okay, so Jason is sensitive.
But now, so is Vince.

255
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,575
Plus Vince has the body. You know?

256
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,160
So....

257
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,373
It's really just about the math.

258
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,174
-Jason.
-Yeah, come on in.

259
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,059
Uh, Phoebe, you sounded serious
on the phone.

260
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,228
Is, uh, anything wrong?

261
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,688
No.

262
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,165
You must be Ross.

263
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,377
-Hi.
-I am Guru Saj.

264
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:08,050
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never
been to a guru before, so....

265
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,137
Well, relax. If it makes you
feel any better, I've attended...

266
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,640
...some of the finest medical schools
in Central America.

267
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,728
Well, then, let's take a look
at this skin abnormality of yours.

268
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,813
Come on, have a seat.

269
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,232
Aha.

270
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,862
Aha. As I suspected, it's a kundus.

271
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,199
What's a "kundus"?

272
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,952
I don't know. What's a kundus with you?

273
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,833
Please lie down.

274
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,920
I've got a salve that
ought to shrink that right up.

275
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,255
Well, I guess it's worth a try.

276
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,508
Oh, sure. We should see results-

277
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,427
Whoa! Clearly not the way to go.

278
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,514
What? What?

279
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,807
We appear to have angered it.

280
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,227
We? We angered it?

281
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,481
Oh. I think I see the problem.

282
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,610
And I'm afraid we're gonna
have to use a much stronger tool.

283
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,780
Love.

284
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,074
Oh, God.

285
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:18,704
Ross, there is absolutely no way
this is gonna come off...

286
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,581
-...unless you start to....
-Ow.

287
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,125
-Oops.
-What was that?

288
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,586
Well, it's gone.

289
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,713
How's that?

290
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,924
Got caught in my watch.

291
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,510
Hey, ha, ha.

292
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,722
Lights.

293
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,059
Uh, romantic lights.

294
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,979
Ooh, nice. Ha, ha.

295
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,566
So, uh, there was this thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

296
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,611
Oh, right.
I completely forgot about that.

297
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,322
Well, uh....

298
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,658
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

299
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,785
And I look at my life-

300
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,495
Yeah?

301
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,999
-and I feel like I've conquered
the business world.

302
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,877
And I feel like I've conquered
the intellectual world.

303
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,631
And now I have the most
beautiful woman in the world.

304
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,592
Wow.

305
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,387
But there's one thing missing.

306
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,931
What's that?

307
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,561
It's time for me to conquer
the physical world.

308
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,565
Okay.

309
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,403
Monica? I wanna become...

310
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,364
...the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

311
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,242
You wanna what?

312
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,287
I wanna become
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

313
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,081
It's the most intense
physical competition in the world.

314
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,958
It's banned in 49 states.

315
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,377
What are you talking about?

316
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,212
Okay, my trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me...

317
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,049
...a combination of Jeet Kune Do
and Brazilian street-fighting.

318
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,594
I even had my own
octagon training ring designed.

319
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,680
And I suppose you used
a ring designer for that.

320
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,390
Yeah.

321
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,811
Monica, I want you there
in the front row when I win.

322
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,481
I want you close enough
to smell the blood.

323
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,151
What do you think?

324
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,655
My parents will be so happy.

325
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,829
<i>Crazy underwear
Creeping up my butt</i>

326
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,502
<i>Crazy underwear
Always in a rut</i>

327
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,338
<i>Crazy underwear</i>

328
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,093
<i>Oh, no. What is he doing here?</i>

329
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,178
<i>All right, just keep playing,
just keep playing.</i>

330
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,014
<i>You'll get through this. You'll be fine.</i>

331
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,859
Okay, thank you.

332
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,155
And as always, no one talk to me
after the show.

333
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,202
Hey.

334
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,704
I just was passing by
and saw you were playing.

335
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,540
This is kind of cool,
seeing you up there.

336
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,166
Well, hey.

337
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,127
Whoa, hey, hey.

338
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,379
What's going on here? Who's this guy?

339
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,050
I don't know. He just started
kissing me. Get him, Vince.

340
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,262
What?

341
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,724
Yeah, okay, I've been dating both of you.

342
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,311
And it's been really horrible,
because, you know, it's been...

343
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,731
...a lot of fun for me.

344
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,361
But I like you both...

345
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,989
...and I didn't know how to choose.

346
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,951
So I'm sorry. I'm terrible.
I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.

347
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:47,621
Phoebe, Phoebe. Relax. It's okay.
I mean....

348
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,832
We never said this was exclusive.

349
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,085
Yeah, neither did we.
So give yourself a break.

350
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,045
Really?

351
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,340
Yeah, I mean, you know,
we haven't been going out that long.

352
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:02,052
Come on, we haven't even
slept together yet. Ha, ha.

353
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,721
You haven't?

354
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,935
-You have?
-Okay, well, this is none of my business.

355
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,858
I can't believe this. You slept with him?

356
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,819
Well, I made you
a candlelight dinner in the park.

357
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,990
You know, Phoebe,
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

358
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,124
Well, that could've been really awkward.

359
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,130
You made him a candlelight dinner
in the park?

360
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,134
Yeah, but I can do that for you.
I'm gonna do that for you.

361
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,553
You know, I can't believe
I went out with somebody...

362
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,599
...who'd actually have an open flame
in the middle of a wooded area.

363
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,402
Everything's gonna be all right.

364
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,239
Okay, Dick?

365
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,785
Hello. I am Guru Saj.

366
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,745
Whoa.

367
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,457
He's supposed to be a duck, right?
Because otherwise...

368
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:16,001
...this is way out of my league.

369
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:20,839
Yeah, yeah. He's got a really bad cough,
and our vet, he can't do anything about it.

370
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,133
-Is there something you can do?
-Hmm.

371
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,302
Let me see.

372
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,888
Let me see.

373
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,684
Do you think you could get him
to eat a bat?
