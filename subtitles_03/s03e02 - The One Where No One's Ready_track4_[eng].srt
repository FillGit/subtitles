1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,504
All right, they got water,
orange juice...

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,257
...and what looks like cider.

3
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:08,800
Taste it.

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:14,932
Yeah, it's fat.

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,475
I drank fat!

6
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:20,270
I know, I did that two minutes ago.

7
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:23,941
Hey.

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,609
Hey, Mr. Tux.

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,445
-Why aren't you dressed?
-We have a half-hour.

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,823
That was four minutes ago.
We have to be out the door at 20 to 8.

11
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:35,577
Relax, we'll be ready. It takes us
two minutes to get dressed.

12
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,996
I'd feel better if you
got dressed now.

13
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,915
-Okay.
-Okay.

14
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,710
Hey!

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,796
Oh, look at you, all sexy.

16
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,089
Really?

17
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,008
Wow!

18
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,052
-Hi.
-Hi.

19
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:57,182
-How come you didn't come over earlier?
-Because I'm a stupid, stupid man.

20
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,477
Hey, Ross, want some cider?

21
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,770
No.

22
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,898
So you're pretty close, huh?

23
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,942
Makeup's on. Hair's done.

24
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,568
I just have to get dressed.

25
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,613
And that takes, what?
Just 6 or 7 minutes?

26
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,241
Yeah. Once I figure out
what I'm wearing.

27
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,203
Glass of fat?

28
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,165
The One Where No One's Ready

29
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,048
What's the matter?
You nervous about your speech?

30
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,674
Nope.

31
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,136
-You wanna hear it?
-Am I in it?

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,222
Uh-huh.

33
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,977
After I thank everyone
for donating to the museum...

34
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,980
...I sing a song about the wonder
that is Joey.

35
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,858
-Hello.
-Hey.

36
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,068
Whoa!

37
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,694
Hello! You look great!

38
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,072
Thank you. I know, though.

39
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,535
You see this? This is a person
who is ready to go.

40
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,953
Phoebe, you....

41
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,580
You are my star.

42
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,917
Aw. Well, you're my lucky penny.

43
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:55,008
All right, I took the quiz, and it
turns out I do put career before men.

44
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,804
Get up.

45
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,263
What?

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,225
-You're in my seat.
-How is this your seat?

47
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,938
I was sitting there.

48
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,606
But then you left.

49
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,734
Well, it's not like I went to Spain.

50
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,904
I went to the bathroom.
You knew I'd be back.

51
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,948
What's the big deal?
Sit somewhere else!

52
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,702
The "big deal" is, I was sitting
there last! So...

53
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,245
...it's my seat.

54
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,958
Well, actually, the last place
you were sitting was in there, so....

55
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,002
You guys, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

56
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:35,799
You both have to go get dressed before
the big vein in my head pops.

57
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,802
I just have to do one thing.
It's not a big deal.

58
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,220
Get up!

59
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,056
-Hi.
-Hey.

60
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,517
Ooh. Phoebe, you look great!

61
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,978
All right already.

62
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,772
Ooh. Are you gonna do magic?

63
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,068
That's funny. Change.

64
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,154
-Hang on, I just got in.
-I don't care.

65
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,239
It starts at 8.
We can't be late.

66
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,325
"He could not, would not,
want to wait."

67
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,829
Our table is down in front.
My boss will be there.

68
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,457
Everyone will see if we arrive
after it starts.

69
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,667
Has somebody been drinking my fat?

70
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,006
Does this look like something a
paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?

71
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,842
I don't know.
You might be the first one.

72
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,345
-Rach, did you check the machine?
-No.

73
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,683
Wait. This is the outfit that makes
my calves look fat. Never mind.

74
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,440
Well, Joey, I wrote
a little song today.

75
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,192
It's called, "Get up!"

76
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,112
All right. You can have the chair.

77
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,532
-Really?
-Oh, my. Would you look at that?

78
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,163
<i>I'm coming over.</i>

79
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,999
<i>What if I'm already there
when you play this message?</i>

80
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,126
Is that too spooky?

81
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,672
<i>Hi, Rach, are you there?
It's me. Pick up.</i>

82
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,883
<i>Rachel? Rach?</i>

83
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,635
What?

84
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,179
Never mind.

85
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,059
<i>Monica, it's Richard. Call me.</i>

86
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,231
Is that message old or new?

87
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,359
Old or new? Old or new?

88
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,403
It's definitely old.
Didn't you hear the double beep?

89
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,073
What if it's new?
We agreed not to talk.

90
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,076
It could be important.
Shouldn't I call him back?

91
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,703
Honey, you did call him back.
It's old.

92
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,997
Yeah, see, Mon, listen. Listen.

93
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,333
When Carol and I broke up...

94
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,628
...I went through the same thing.
You know what I did?

95
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,839
I got dressed.

96
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,344
Really, really quickly, okay? Okay?

97
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,596
There we go. There we go.

98
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,766
You know what? Don't get up.
Just sit there.

99
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,103
I just hope you don't mind
my hand right here.

100
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,732
Not touching. Can't get mad!
Not touching. Can't get mad!

101
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,110
Not touching. Can't get mad!

102
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,737
Oh! Oh, my God!

103
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,614
You rotten boys!

104
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,034
-Sorry, Phoebe.
-What am I gonna do?

105
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,120
Don't rub it!
What gets out hummus?

106
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,038
What gets out hummus?

107
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,583
Monica! What gets out hummus?

108
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,962
If it is a new message,
what is he calling to say?

109
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,048
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.

110
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,802
Maybe he called to say
you're obsessive and crazy?

111
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,305
-So should I call him back?
-No!

112
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,724
No!

113
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,812
-Fine, we'll both sit in the chair.
-Fine with me.

114
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,068
I am so comfortable.

115
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,321
Me too.

116
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,199
In fact, I think I might be
a little too comfortable.

117
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,916
Okay, we have 19 minutes.
I want you to go and change.

118
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,337
When you come back, Joey will go change,
and he'll have vacated the chair.

119
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,838
-Okay.
-All right.

120
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,632
Fine. I'm going.

121
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,427
When I get back, it's Chair City.
And I'm the guy...

122
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,346
...who's sitting in a chair!

123
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,807
Is this a little too--?

124
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,018
Pheebs? What happened?

125
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,519
I got the hummus.

126
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,774
Oh, honey, we'll find you something.
You wanna wear my black jacket?

127
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,193
-It won't go with this dress.
-You're right.

128
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,822
-Well, let's just get you out of that.
-No, no, no. Not out of that.

129
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,950
-Not out of clothes.
-Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?

130
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,160
I called him.

131
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,748
Yes. I got his machine
and I left a message.

132
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,458
But it's okay. It's okay...

133
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,878
...because it was, like,
a casual, breezy message.

134
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,171
It was breezy.

135
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,966
Oh, God, what if it wasn't breezy?

136
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:50,553
How could it not be breezy? No,
because you're in such a breezy place.

137
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,517
I got it. I'll play my message, and
you guys tell me if it's breezy enough.

138
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,811
But how you gonna do that?

139
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,897
I know the code
to his answering machine.

140
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,692
Okay, Mon, I really don't think
this is the-

141
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,653
Okay, you're dialing.
You are dialing.

142
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,541
<i>Hi, this is Richard.
Please leave a message at the tone.</i>

143
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,586
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

144
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,422
What a cool job.

145
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,674
"You have two new messages."

146
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,845
Please pass the pie.

147
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,808
<i>Hi, it's Monica.
I'm just checking in.</i>

148
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,270
<i>I got a message and didn't know
if it was old or new...</i>

149
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
<i>...so I'm just checking.</i>

150
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,357
<i>So let me know.</i>

151
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,942
<i>Or don't. Whatever.</i>

152
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,777
<i>I'm breezy!</i>

153
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,615
You can't say you're "breezy."
That negates the "breezy."

154
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,871
<i>Hola. It's me.
Yesterday was really fun.</i>

155
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,832
<i>Call me about this weekend, okay?</i>

156
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,754
Now, she sounded breezy.

157
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:13,136
He's seeing someone.
I can't believe he's seeing someone.

158
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,972
-You don't know that.
-Well, whose voice was that?

159
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,142
Maybe it was his sister's.
Maybe it was his daughter's.

160
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,813
Michelle. Of course!
Did it sound like Michelle?

161
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:28,485
Oh, great. It's starting to rain.
That'll make it easier to get a cab.

162
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,487
It was Michelle.

163
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,405
It was definitely Michelle.

164
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,826
Try Monica's green dress. If it
doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.

165
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,662
-Unless I wear it.
-You don't know what you're wearing?

166
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,499
I'm just trying to look nice
for your big night.

167
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,376
Yeah, which we have to leave for
in 12 minutes.

168
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,379
Come on, I'll just pick
something out for you.

169
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,882
You'll notice that I'm fully dressed.

170
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,511
I, in turn, have noticed
that you are not.

171
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:59,557
So in the words of A.A. Milne,
"Get out of my chair, dill-hole."

172
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,394
Okay.

173
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,696
-What are you doing?
-You said to give you the chair.

174
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,032
You didn't say anything about cushions.

175
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,909
They're the essence
of the chair!

176
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,787
That's right! I'm taking the essence.

177
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,706
Oh, he'll be back.

178
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,376
Oh, there's nobody in the room.

179
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,672
-I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
-That was a Halloween costume.

180
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,217
Unless you would like me to go
as Little Bo Peep.

181
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,387
I didn't recognize it
without that inflatable sheep.

182
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,432
Yeah, which, by the way, Chandler,
I would like back one of these days.

183
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,729
Rach, good! Listen, isn't this
perfect for me?

184
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,274
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.

185
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,902
Of course not for tonight.
Hi. I'm going to a benefit.

186
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,238
Not for tonight?
What are you doing?

187
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,783
No, I'm sorry. We didn't mean it.
I love you. Breathe.

188
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,204
We used them as pillows
when we went camping.

189
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,414
What?

190
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,583
The sheep.

191
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,795
Hey, what you do on your own time....

192
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,926
-Where's my underwear?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

193
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,597
-Come on, you took his underwear?
-He took my essence!

194
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:25,643
Okay, hold on. Why can't you just wear
the underwear you're wearing now?

195
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,521
Because I'm not wearing
any underwear now.

196
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,108
Then why do you have
to wear underwear tonight?

197
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,110
It's a rented tux, okay?

198
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,655
I'm not gonna go "commando"
in another man's fatigues.

199
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:43,453
Then somebody's gonna have
to give somebody back his cushions.

200
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:48,458
Okay. You hide my clothes. I'm gonna
do the exact opposite to you.

201
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,880
What, are you gonna show me my clothes?

202
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,548
Hey, opposite...

203
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,800
...is opposite.

204
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,262
He's got nothing!

205
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,681
Okay, I'm ready.

206
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,148
Rachel didn't have anything I liked
but this ribbon.

207
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,817
I thought, all right,
I'll be political.

208
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,656
-What are you supporting?
-Christmas.

209
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:26,162
Hey, that's okay with me. Two down,
and I have exactly 12 minutes-

210
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,664
What?

211
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,292
My watch stopped.
My watch. Okay, see...

212
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,337
...the dinosaur tail
isn't going around anymore.

213
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,590
What time is it? It's 7:33.
I have 7 minutes.

214
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,008
I have seven minutes!

215
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,178
Which shoes should I wear?
The black or the purple?

216
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,889
-Just pick one, okay?
-Oh, okay, okay. The black.

217
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,392
Do you have black
with little strappies?

218
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,688
Yeah, but those go better with pants.
Maybe I should wear pants.

219
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,818
Yeah, pants! What an idea!
Or better yet, go without pants.

220
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,113
I don't know what you're doing
but just get in there...

221
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,865
...and pick out any shoes
that fit your feet.

222
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,536
I don't care if they match.
I don't care if they make...

223
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:11,374
...your ankles or your knees or your
earlobes look fat. Just do it!

224
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,252
Go in there, pick something out
so we can go.

225
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,549
-All right.
-Thank you.

226
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:24,095
I've got to call Michelle to see
if that was her voice.

227
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,222
It was. It was her voice.

228
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,559
Monica, I think you've gone over
to the bad place.

229
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,398
<i>Hola.</i>

230
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,067
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

231
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,488
-Okay. That was her, right?
-Definitely. Yeah.

232
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,574
So there you go. Whew!

233
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,077
We're out of the woods.
I think I'll get dressed now.

234
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,414
-I'll get it.
-Okay.

235
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,125
Hi, Monica and Rachel's.

236
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,670
Yeah, just a second.
Can I ask who's calling?

237
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,255
Ooh! It's Michelle! Ooh!

238
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,428
She must have that "caller I.D." thing.
You should get that.

239
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,474
Michelle?

240
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,936
Yeah, that was me.
I dialed your number by mistake.

241
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,313
Just try to be-

242
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,775
You're so sweet.

243
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,486
Yeah, we were a great couple.

244
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,696
I know, I really miss him.

245
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,908
Well, you know how it is.
It's just that....

246
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,785
You know what's weird?

247
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,789
Donald Duck never wore pants.

248
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,125
But when he gets
out of the shower...

249
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,961
...he always puts a towel
around his waist.

250
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,925
I mean, what is that about?

251
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,429
I only beeped in so I could
hear my own message.

252
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,972
I mean, that's allowed.

253
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,474
Yeah!

254
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:57,063
I would really appreciate it if you
wouldn't tell your dad about-

255
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,483
What do you mean, you don't feel
comfortable with this? We're friends!

256
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,862
That bitch always hated me.

257
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,574
-I'm calling her back.
-No, no, no! Tick, tick, tick.

258
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,493
-Okay, fine.
-Okay.

259
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,164
-She's got a phone in there, right?
-Okay, we're on it.

260
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,008
Um, hen, hen....

261
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,846
I know it says, "black tie optional"...

262
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,765
...but this may be pushing it a little.

263
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,851
I'm not gonna go.

264
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,229
You're not gonna go?

265
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,191
No, I think I'm gonna catch up
on my correspondence.

266
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,529
How can you not be going?

267
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,531
I'm not gonna go.

268
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,535
So I think that will accomplish
the "not going."

269
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,750
Um, you know, just out of curiosity-

270
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,504
Ever since I was humiliated
and yelled at in front of my friends...

271
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:08,134
...I'm just, I don't know, not in a
very museum benefit-y kind of mood.

272
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,388
Right. Well, okay. Okay.
God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.

273
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,807
-That's fine.
-No, but you're mad.

274
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,018
I'm not mad. I'm just not going.

275
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,728
-Right.
-Okay.

276
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,065
-You know that I have to go, right?
-Mm-hm.

277
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,778
So is it gonna be like
I'm abandoning you while you're upset?

278
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,988
-No.
-No?

279
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:33,242
-You're not upset about the yelling.
-Right. And the humiliating.

280
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,578
Well, of course, the humiliating.

281
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,664
So we...

282
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,416
...we're okay?

283
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,627
-We're good.
-Right.

284
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,257
-Honey? I love you.
-Yes, Ross.

285
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,469
Get away from that phone!

286
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,182
She's just getting dressed now.

287
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,647
Is it wrong that I was
totally aroused by that?

288
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,115
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

289
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,328
You hide my clothes.
I'm wearing everything you own.

290
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,455
Oh, my God!

291
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,794
That is so not the opposite
of taking somebody's underwear!

292
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,629
Look at me! I'm Chandler.

293
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,799
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

294
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,678
Maybe if I wasn't going commando....

295
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,102
It's hot with all this stuff on.

296
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,896
I better not do any,
I don't know, lunges.

297
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,985
Okay, enough.
Enough with the lunging.

298
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,862
I'm sick of this.
I've had it up to here.

299
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,615
Neither of you can come to the party!

300
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,617
Jeez, what a baby!

301
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,329
Way to ruin it.
I was just gonna go get dressed.

302
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,999
The only person
I cared about getting dressed...

303
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,668
...is the person who's
not even gonna go.

304
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,753
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?

305
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:12,133
Look, I was a jerk, okay?
I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there.

306
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,634
I need you there.

307
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,223
What can I do to show you
how much I want you to be there?

308
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,351
You could drink the fat.

309
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,523
Welcome to an adult conversation.

310
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,234
No, no, no.
Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.

311
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,196
-That actually sounds interesting.
-What?

312
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,574
I think you should drink the fat.

313
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,409
Yay!

314
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,959
Okay, if that's what it takes to
show you how much you mean to me...

315
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,879
...and how much I want you there,
that's what I'll do.

316
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,965
Let me get you another glass.
That's been sitting out.

317
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,718
I think this will be fine.

318
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,889
Okay, vanilla milkshake.
Just a vanilla milkshake...

319
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,975
...with chicken bits floating in it.

320
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,438
Cheers.

321
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,316
No, don't! Okay, okay, I'll go.
I'll go.

322
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,734
You will?

323
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,570
You were really gonna do that?

324
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,821
Well, yeah.

325
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,908
You were gonna drink the fat.

326
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,455
Let's see what else he'll do!

327
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,126
How about you get changed?
Give him his underwear.

328
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,630
I'll get a cab. I want everyone
downstairs in two minutes.

329
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,964
Monica!

330
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,591
Stop it.

331
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:36,926
Stop it!

332
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,099
Ross went to get a cab so we--

333
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,935
What are you doing? No, Monica, no!

334
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,731
<i>Hi, this is Richard.</i>

335
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,111
<i>You have three new messages.</i>

336
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,738
Not anymore.

337
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,949
<i>Message erased.</i>

338
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,122
<i>To record your message,
begin speaking at the tone.</i>

339
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,625
Hi, Richard. It's Monica.

340
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,837
Listen, I did something
kind of crazy tonight.

341
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,965
Maybe I'm getting my period
or something. I don't know.

342
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,302
Anyway, I beeped into your machine
and I heard this message...

343
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,971
...that freaked me out...

344
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,307
...and Michelle will tell you the rest.

345
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:30,271
I'm sorry, okay? And I hope that we
can just forget the whole thing.

346
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,777
<i>Your outgoing message has
now been changed.</i>

347
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,904
Outgoing?

348
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,364
Did that say outgoing?

349
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,991
Not outgoing!

350
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,079
<i>Hi, Richard, it's Monica.</i>

351
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,291
<i>Listen, I did something
kind of crazy tonight.</i>

352
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,169
<i>Maybe I'm getting my period
or something. I don't know.</i>

353
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,838
-How did you do that?
-I don't know!

354
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,174
<i>Goodbye.</i>
-No!

355
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:00,926
Okay.

356
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:05,389
Okay, I've got two cabs
and no people! Go, go, go!

357
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,851
Maybe we can call the phone company
to change the message?

358
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,394
They could change his number.

359
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,731
I think after this,
he'll be doing that himself.

360
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,734
Rachel!

361
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:21,614
Wow!

362
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,201
You....
You look....

363
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,869
Wow!

364
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,873
And I still have about
five seconds to spare.

365
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,589
That was about 7 seconds.

366
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,424
So we're a little late.

367
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,426
Come on.

368
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,262
Oh, and by the way....

369
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,555
What?

370
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,140
I'm going commando too.

371
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,736
Dr. Geller?

372
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,532
-Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
-What a pleasure.

373
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:09,620
I was quite impressed with your
paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.

374
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,122
Yes, it confirmed everything
I'd written.

375
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,749
Excuse me.

376
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,042
Hi.

377
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,627
Yes?

378
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,712
You're kind of sitting in my seat.

379
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,715
What do you mean, your seat?

380
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,219
-I mean, I was sitting there.
-But you got up.

381
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,555
But I never left the room.

382
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,641
But you left the chair area.

383
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,020
All right, that's it.
Give me your underwear.
