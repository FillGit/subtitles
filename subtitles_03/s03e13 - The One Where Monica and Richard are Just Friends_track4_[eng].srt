1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,254
Hey.

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,508
Six dollars, please.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,219
Six? I just had it for one night. It's 3.

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:14,056
Eight o'clock is the cutoff.
And, oh, it's 8:02.

5
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,435
You know, in a weird way,
you have too much power.

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,648
Look, you're gonna have to help me
out here because I only have 3.

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,858
I can help with that.

8
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,029
Oh, my God. Richard?

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,615
-Hi.
-Hi.

10
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,368
Wow. Your lip went bald.

11
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,579
Thanks.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,458
So you look great.

13
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,709
Yeah, right. Ha, ha.

14
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,003
No, you do. You....

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,422
-You just- You....
-What?

16
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,883
You got panties stuck to your leg.

17
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,932
Ahem, that's because I was just grabbing
some things out of the dryer...

18
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,226
...and static cling. Ha, ha.

19
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,812
Or maybe it's just because God knew
I'd be running into you...

20
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,689
...and saw an opportunity.

21
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:05,857
It's good to see you.

22
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,985
It's good to see you too.

23
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,707
-See that guy? He's in "Classics" now...
-Who?

24
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,252
...but you know as soon as we leave,
he's going straight to the porn.

25
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,546
He's gonna go up to the counter
with <i>Citizen Kane...</i>

26
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,174
<i>-...Vertigo </i>and <i>Clockwork Orgy.
</i>-Ha, ha.

27
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,929
This is nice.

28
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,890
-Ha, ha. Yeah.
-I miss this.

29
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,433
Me too.

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,393
So you wanna get a hamburger
or something?

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,729
Aw, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.

32
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,732
No. Just friends. I won't grope you.
I promise.

33
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,568
Yeah, I think it's too soon.

34
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,529
No, it's not too soon. I had lunch at 11.

35
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,993
Yeah, baby.

36
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,455
-What are you doing?
-Making chocolate milk. You want some?

37
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,165
No, thanks. I'm 29.

38
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,502
Oh, my God. I gotta go to work.

39
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,004
What time do you think
you're gonna get off tonight?

40
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,923
I don't know, honey.
It could be really late.

41
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,674
Oh, come on. Not again.

42
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,719
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.
Listen, I'll make a deal with you, okay?

43
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,471
-Mm.
-Every night that you're asleep...

44
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,264
-...before I get home from work...
-Yeah.

45
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,352
...I will wake you up in a way
that has proved very popular in the past.

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,313
Well, now, if you need to stay late,
I want to be supportive of that.

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,690
Thank you.

48
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,608
-Hi.
-Hey, Pheebs.

49
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,068
-Hi.
-Hey.

50
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,696
Look at you.
Since when do you Rollerblade?

51
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,073
Oh. Since tomorrow.

52
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,283
I met this really cute guy in the park.

53
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,954
And he, like, you know, jogs and blades
and swims, and so we made a deal.

54
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,833
He's gonna teach me how
to do all sorts of jock stuff.

55
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,502
-And what are you gonna do for him?
-I'm gonna let him.

56
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,337
-Okay.
-Cool.

57
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,631
-Morning.
-Hey.

58
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,050
-Somebody got in late last night.
-Ahem.

59
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,386
Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.

60
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,141
-When did this happen?
-Oh, urn, around 8:02.

61
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,018
And we, uh, talked for a little while...

62
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,813
...and then, um, we went out
for an innocent burger.

63
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,566
Oh, there's no such thing
as an innocent burger.

64
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,485
-Are you gonna see him again?
-Tomorrow night.

65
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,529
Monica, what are you doing?

66
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,990
Well, she spent the last six months
getting over him...

67
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:04,786
...and now she's celebrating that
by going on a date with him.

68
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,248
It's not a date, okay?

69
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,710
I'm just gonna teach him how to make
a lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.

70
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,504
Well, you might want to make a little extra
because, you know...

71
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,048
-...you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
-Mm.

72
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,177
We're not gonna have sex.

73
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,179
Okay? Nothing's changed here.

74
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,681
He still doesn't want children,
and I still do.

75
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,767
So that's why we're gonna
just be friends.

76
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,643
Naked friends.

77
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,650
-Hey. Do you have any ice?
-Hey.

78
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,068
Check the freezer.

79
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,696
If there's none in there,
we're probably out.

80
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,157
Are you just getting home from work?
It's late.

81
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,659
Yeah, I know.
I had the greatest day, though.

82
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,329
I got to sit in on a meeting
with the reps from Calvin Klein.

83
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,541
I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie,
she ordered a ton of it.

84
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,876
How was your day?

85
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,254
I discovered I'm able to count all my teeth
using just my tongue.

86
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,382
Hmm.

87
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,842
Urn....

88
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,554
Why do you have a copy of <i>The Shining
</i>in your freezer?

89
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,558
Oh. I was reading it last night
and I got scared, so....

90
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,230
But, uh, you're safe from it
if it's in the freezer?

91
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,607
Well, safer.

92
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,400
I never start reading <i>The Shining...</i>

93
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,153
...without making sure
we got plenty of room in the freezer.

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,404
-You know?
-Ha, ha.

95
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,740
How often do you read it?

96
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,535
Haven't you ever read the same book
over and over again?

97
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,579
Well, um, I guess I read <i>Little Women
</i>more than once.

98
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,040
But that's a classic.
What's so great about <i>The Shining?</i>

99
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,877
The question should be, Rach,
"What is not so great about <i>The Shining?"</i>

100
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,924
Okay? And the answer would be, "Nothing."
All right?

101
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,884
This is, like, the scariest book ever.

102
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,804
I bet it's way better
than that classic of yours.

103
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,098
-Ha, ha.
-Okay.

104
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,433
Uh, well, we'll just see about that, okay?

105
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,314
I will read <i>The Shining,
</i>and you will read <i>Little Women.</i>

106
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,983
-All right, you got it.
-All right?

107
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,192
-Okay.
-Okay.

108
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,654
-Uh, now, Rach, these little women....
-Yeah.

109
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,240
How little are they?

110
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,410
I mean, are they, like, scary little?

111
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,961
-Um, Chandler, Ross? This is Robert.
-Oh, hey.

112
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,255
-Hi.
-You have lipstick right here.

113
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,132
-Oh.
-Huh. That's okay, it's mine.

114
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,842
We just kissed.

115
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,304
So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

116
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,015
Well, I'm from California.

117
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,685
Right, right. Sometimes you guys
just burst into flame.

118
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,824
I'm up. Ahem. I'm up. I've gotten up now.

119
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,909
Anybody, uh, want anything?

120
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,411
-I'll have coffee.
-Yeah, me too.

121
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:55,081
-Yeah, make that three.
-Okay. Ross, why don't you come with me?

122
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,169
Okay. Ha, ha.

123
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,505
What is the matter with you?
What's going on?

124
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,674
Robert's coming out.

125
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,968
What do you mean? What, is he gay?

126
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,388
No, he....

127
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,435
He's coming out of his shorts.

128
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,689
What?

129
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,525
The man is showing brain.

130
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,491
Are you sure? Hold on.

131
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,203
Ahem. I'm sorry, you guys.
That was a coffee and a....

132
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,205
-Coffee. We could write it down.
-Okay.

133
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,333
No, no. That won't be, uh-
Won't be necessary.

134
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,550
-Well?
-Yeah,yeah, yeah.

135
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,761
What do we do? What do we do?

136
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:55,141
Well, I suppose we just
try to not look directly at it.

137
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,561
Like an eclipse.

138
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,735
When people compliment me
on my cooking tonight, what do I say?

139
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,781
Well, you say, "Thank you very much."
And then you buy me something pretty.

140
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,742
Come on, we're gonna
put our hands in this bowl...

141
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,954
...and we're gonna start
squishing the tomatoes.

142
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,708
Ooh, this feels very weird.

143
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,961
Heh. You touch people's eyeballs every day
and this feels weird?

144
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,255
Yeah, well, sure, I touch them.

145
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,133
But I spent years
learning not to squish them.

146
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,890
That's my hand.

147
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,892
Oh.

148
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,520
-Okay.
-Gotta keep squishing.

149
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,021
The tomatoes are squishing.

150
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,482
-Oh, yeah. Oh.
-Oh.

151
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,068
Oh, gosh. You got some on your shirt.

152
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,445
-Yeah.
-Hold on a second.

153
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,408
Okay, just put a little club soda on it.
Get to it right away.

154
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,827
It should, urn, do...

155
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,747
...the trick.

156
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,257
What?

157
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,634
Um, you've got some on your pants.

158
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,474
I'll just throw them out.

159
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,315
These little women.

160
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,358
Wow.

161
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,611
You're liking it, huh?

162
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:33,323
Oh, yeah.
Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

163
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,658
I don't see how
he could ever forgive her.

164
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,873
Um, Jo's a girl.
It's short for Josephine.

165
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,210
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

166
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,838
Oh.

167
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,009
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

168
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,762
Because that is the one thing missing
from <i>The Shining.</i>

169
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,850
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

170
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,355
No wonder Rachel had to read this
so many times.

171
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,025
-Hey.
-Hey.

172
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,110
Hey, how'd the, uh, basketball go?

173
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:16,282
Oh, okay. I learned how to shoot a lay-up,
a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

174
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,951
You mean a 3-pointer?

175
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,620
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.

176
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,707
So, um, is there a phone here
I can check my messages?

177
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:29,045
-Yeah, in the back. Do you want a quarter?
-Oh, no. I always carry one in my sock.

178
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,060
What are you doing?
Get back over on your side of the-

179
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,854
Hello.

180
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,527
-Hi. I'm Joey. We haven't met.
-Hi.

181
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,612
-Uh, good to meet you. Robert.
-Okay.

182
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,701
What?

183
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,705
What? You guys, what is going on?

184
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,665
Do you not like Robert?

185
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,126
Why are you laughing?

186
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,336
Calm down. No reason to get testy.

187
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,678
-You guys. Come on.
-We're sorry.

188
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:24,642
It just seems that Robert isn't
as concealed in the shorts area...

189
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,269
...as, uh, one may have hoped.

190
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,938
How do you mean?

191
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,399
-Hey.
-Hey.

192
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:36,863
Uh, Robert? Could you, uh,
pass me those cookies?

193
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,698
Sure.

194
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,080
So how'd the lasagna go over?

195
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,668
Really? Good.
So you owe me three pretty things.

196
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,131
Yeah. I've been thinking about you too.

197
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,469
Well, no. It's hard, this platonomy thing.

198
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,971
What-? It's a word.

199
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:09,562
Yeah. I do think it's better this way.
Yeah, we're being smart.

200
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,773
Yes, I'm sure.

201
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,944
You really sure?

202
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,488
I'll call you back.

203
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,918
So we can be friends
who sleep together.

204
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,463
Absolutely.
This'll just be something we do.

205
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,966
Like racquetball.

206
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,594
Yeah. Sounds smart and healthy to me.

207
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,349
So, um, just out of, uh, curiosity...

208
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,812
...um, do you currently have
any other racquetball buddies?

209
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:52,939
Just your dad.

210
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,278
Although that's actually racquetball.

211
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,115
You know, I do have a blind date...

212
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,368
...with my sister's neighbor
next Tuesday.

213
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,039
Do you want me to cancel it?

214
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,708
No.

215
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,086
-No.
-Yeah.

216
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:19,173
Because if you did,
that means you'd be canceling for me.

217
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,052
-And we're just friends.
-Exactly.

218
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,681
Hey.

219
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,725
Hey. Oh, don't sit down.

220
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,601
-Ready to go to the batting cage?
-You bet.

221
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,895
And first, here's a gift. Ha, ha.

222
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,940
Oh, wow.

223
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:39,569
-Hey.
-Stretchy pants?

224
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,904
Well, those are the greatest things
in the world.

225
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,615
If I were you, I'd wear them every day,
every day.

226
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,911
Jeez, thank you. Really, that's so nice.

227
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,458
But, um, to be honest,
I don't think I can wear these.

228
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,878
They're so tight.
I'd feel like I'm on display.

229
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,131
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,009
That's all right. I'll figure....

231
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,638
-Hey.
-How you doing?

232
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,640
-How's it going?
-Good.

233
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,850
-Good.
-Hey, Rach?

234
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:14,729
-How you doing with <i>The Shining?
</i>-Uh, Danny just went into Room 217.

235
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:18,608
Ooh. The next part's the best.
When that dead lady in the bathtub-

236
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,194
No, no, no. Come on.
You're gonna ruin it.

237
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,738
All right, I'll talk in code.

238
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:27,283
Remember when the kid sees
those two blanks in the hallway?

239
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,869
-Yeah, that's very cool.
-Yeah.

240
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:34,624
Ooh. All blank and no blank
makes blank a blank-blank, right?

241
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,294
Oh, no, no. No, the end.

242
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,588
When Jack almost kills them all
with that blank...

243
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,424
...but then in the last second
they get away. Aw.

244
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,677
Joey, I can't believe you just did that.

245
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,514
I can't believe she cracked your code.

246
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:58,189
All right, okay. Laurie proposes to Jo
and she says no...

247
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,652
...even though she's still in love with him.
And then he ends up marrying Amy.

248
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,613
Hey.

249
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,157
Mine was by accident.

250
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,534
All right.

251
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,204
The boiler explodes and destroys
the hotel and kills the dad.

252
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,374
Beth dies.

253
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,885
Beth--? Beth dies?

254
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,095
Mm-hm.

255
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,099
Is that true?
If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

256
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,769
No, Beth doesn't die.
She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

257
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,230
-What?
-Joey's asking if you've just ruined...

258
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,775
...the first book he's ever loved
that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

259
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,574
No. She doesn't die.

260
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,617
Then why would you say that?

261
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,542
Because I wanted to hurt you.

262
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,963
Oh, there they are. I dropped my keys.

263
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,342
Got them.

264
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,390
Hi.

265
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,435
Sorry. I'm sorry.

266
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,729
You would not believe my day.

267
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,816
I had to work two shifts.
And then to top it off...

268
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:28,112
...I lost one of my fake boobs
in a grill fire.

269
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,992
What are you smiling at?

270
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,453
Sorry, I was just thinking your day
could still pick up.

271
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,085
Hello.

272
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,796
I love this friend thing.

273
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,805
Listen, Robert's gonna be here
any second...

274
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,016
...so could one of you just tell him?

275
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,684
-Oh.
-Please, right now.

276
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,855
No, every time I see him, it's like,
"Is it on the loose? Is it watching me?"

277
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:05,691
We can't tell him.

278
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,903
You can't go up to a guy you barely know
and talk about his...

279
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,322
...stuff.

280
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:15,326
He's right. Even if it's
to say something complimentary.

281
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,665
-Hey.
-Hey.

282
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,874
So you ready for the gym?

283
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,086
They've got this new rock-climbing wall.
We can spot each other.

284
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,507
Yeah, I can spot you from here.

285
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,136
What?

286
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,557
Okay. Listen, ahem, Robert....

287
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,686
-Hey, don't we have to...?
-Yeah, we got- Yeah. Mm-hm.

288
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,315
Urn....

289
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,986
I think you're really, really great.

290
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,489
Oh, God. Here we go again.

291
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:58,202
Why does this keep happening to me?
Is it something I'm putting out there?

292
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:04,083
Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

293
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,881
I don't know what to say.

294
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,803
Hey, buddy? This is a family place.
Put the mouse back in the house.

295
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,200
Ow.

296
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:43,539
Really? Well, it's just like
everyone else's apartment.

297
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,541
It's got, uh, rooms and walls and ceilings.

298
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,252
I just wanted to see where you
live. Now give me the tour.

299
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,504
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

300
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,882
-Uh, this is the living room.
-That's nice.

301
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,300
All right.

302
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,136
-And this is the kitchen.
-That's real pretty.

303
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,180
Wait a minute.
Don't I get to see the bedroom?

304
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:03,392
The bedroom. Well, it's
pretty much your typical...

305
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,063
-...bedroom.
-Oh, ha, ha.

306
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,482
-We're still on this side of the door. Ha, ha.
-Mm-hm.

307
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,067
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.

308
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,780
Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.
Thanks for a lovely evening.

309
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,508
So, um, who is she?

310
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,428
Oh, ha, ha. That was the blind date
I told you about.

311
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,681
-She called and switched it from Tuesday.
-Aw.

312
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,643
Did you like her?

313
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:50,773
And I'm just asking as a friend
because I am totally fine with this.

314
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,111
Well, you seem fine.

315
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,073
Okay, you know what?
I'm not fine. I'm not.

316
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,993
I mean, how could I be fine?
Hearing you come in with her.

317
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,579
She wants to see your bedroom.

318
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,588
You know what?

319
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,135
What if we're friends...

320
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,720
...who don't see other people?

321
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,641
You mean like exclusive friends?

322
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,060
Why not?

323
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,148
I mean, this has been
the most amazing week.

324
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,568
Would it be so terrible?

325
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:40,489
Even if we were friends
who lived together?

326
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:47,163
Or maybe someday, friends who stood
up in front of their other friends...

327
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,749
...and vowed to be friends forever.

328
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,379
Wow.

329
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,508
You know, we're back where we were.

330
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:06,307
Honey, I would love to do all that,
but nothing's changed.

331
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:10,227
That's not true.
You don't have a mustache.

332
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,732
Okay. Okay, one thing's changed.

333
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,861
But we still want different things,
and we know how this is gonna end.

334
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,614
You know what?

335
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,867
I gotta walk out of here right now.

336
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:30,206
Because getting over you is
the hardest thing that I have ever had to do.

337
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,043
Um, I don't think I could do it again.

338
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,004
I know I couldn't.

339
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,049
Yeah.

340
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,053
So....

341
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,356
How about one last game of racquetball?
Hmm?

342
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,405
-Watch the thorns.
-Ow.

343
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:11,872
What?

344
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,251
Beth is really, really sick.

345
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,752
Oh.

346
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,802
Jo's there, but I don't think
there's anything she can do.

347
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,682
-Joey?
-Yeah?

348
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,351
You wanna put the book in the freezer?

349
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,354
Okay.
