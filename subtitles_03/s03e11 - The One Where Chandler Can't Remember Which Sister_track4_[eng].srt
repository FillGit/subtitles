1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,796
Okay, pick a card, any card.

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,549
All right, now memorize it.

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,010
Show it to everybody.

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,220
-Got it?
-Mm-hm.

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,472
All right. Give it back to me.

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,978
Five of hearts.

7
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,773
-Real magic does exist.
-Oh, wow.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,317
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?

9
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,944
I can't tell you that. No.

10
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,783
Uh, somebody's at the door
on the ceiling.

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,703
Heh. No, that's our unbelievably loud
upstairs neighbor.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,540
He took up the carpets,
and now you can hear everything.

13
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,210
Well, why don't you go up there
and ask him to just step lightly, please?

14
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,256
I have, like five times,
but the guy is so charming...

15
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,384
...that I go up there to yell,
and I end up apologizing to him.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,512
Oh, that is silly.

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,847
I'll go up there.
I'll tell him to keep it down.

18
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,933
-All right, be my guest.
-Good luck.

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,601
All right, all right, all right.

20
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,187
If you really wanna know how I did it,
I'll show you.

21
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,732
When you handed me back the card,
what you didn't see was...

22
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,069
...I looked at it so fast,
it was invisible to the naked eye.

23
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,240
I just did it.

24
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,992
Just did it again.

25
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,663
Here, I'll slow it down
so you guys can see it. Ready?

26
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,168
-Oh.
-I got it now. Okay.

27
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,968
I was at my friend's downstairs...

28
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,262
...and we hear every single thing
that you do.

29
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,854
Oh. Ha, ha. Thank you.

30
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,947
Hey.

31
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,243
Anybody got a length of rope
about 6 feet long with a noose at the end?

32
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,371
-Honey, what's the matter?
-I just saw Janice.

33
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,664
Aw.

34
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,583
She was at Rockefeller Center,
skating with her husband.

35
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,960
She looked so happy.

36
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,714
I almost feel bad
for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.

37
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,219
I remember the first time
I saw that girl Katherine after we broke up.

38
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,389
She was walking with her friend Donna,
just laughing and talking.

39
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,015
God, it killed me.

40
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:06,478
Yes, but you ended up having sex
with both of them that afternoon.

41
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,607
Sorry, I just-
Any excuse to tell that story.

42
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,196
Hey, Chandler, there's a party tomorrow.
You'll feel better then.

43
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,866
Oh. You know what? I'm gonna be okay.
You don't have to throw a party for me.

44
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,202
It's Joey's birthday.

45
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,164
Oh, well, then if anybody
should have a party, it should be him.

46
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,211
Shh. I cannot believe she's still up there.

47
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,765
Okay, well,
he totally screwed up the punch line.

48
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,100
You know, it's supposed to be:

49
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,945
-How's that coffee coming, dear?
-Yeah. Right away, Mr. Kaplan.

50
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,656
I'm not supposed to drink coffee.
It makes me gassy.

51
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,160
I know.

52
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,872
I'll bet you're thinking,
"What's an intelligent girl...

53
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,749
...who wants to be in fashion
doing making coffee?"

54
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,420
-Ah? Ah? Ha, ha.
-Oh, ha, ha. You got me. Heh.

55
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,755
Don't think I haven't noticed
your potential.

56
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:20,177
Well, I've got a project for you
that's a lot more related to fashion.

57
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,929
-How does that sound?
-Oh. That sounds great.

58
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,266
-Come on over here, sweetheart.
-Thank you so much, Mr. Kaplan.

59
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,812
I need these hangers separated ASAP.

60
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,316
You're welcome.

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,739
Oh, God, I hate my job.
I hate it. I hate my job.

62
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,574
I know, honey. I'm sorry.

63
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,119
Oh. I wanna quit,
but then I think I should stick it out.

64
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,579
Then I think...

65
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,874
...why would such a person stay
in such a demeaning job...

66
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:55,587
...just because it's remotely related
to the field they're interested in?

67
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,924
Gee, I don't know, Rach.

68
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,928
Order up. I got a Yentl soup, James Beans,
and a Howdy, hold the Doody.

69
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,764
Oh. Honey, come on, I'm sorry. I didn't-

70
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,307
I don't mind paying my dues.

71
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,893
It's just, how much am I gonna learn
about fashion...

72
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,646
...by walking Myra,
the arthritic seamstress...

73
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,356
...to the bathroom?

74
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,736
Hi. Is my misery amusing to you?

75
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,781
I'm sorry, I was just, uh.... Ha, ha.

76
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,075
It's not funny. This is actually my job.

77
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,785
Oh, believe me, I've been there.

78
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:30,330
I had to sort mannequin heads
at Mannequins Plus.

79
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:34,876
Oh. Well, then, so I'm just gonna go back
to talking to my friend here.

80
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,088
You can go back
to enjoying your little hamburger.

81
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,759
-Uh, just one other thing.
-Ahem. Yes?

82
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,511
I work at Bloomingdale's...

83
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,931
...and I might know of a job possibility,
if you're interested.

84
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,269
Do you want my pickle?

85
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,610
Hey, guys.

86
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,903
-Hey, Gunther.
-Hi.

87
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,698
You're going out on a date
with the noisy guy upstairs?

88
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,368
-Well, he's very charming.
-I know, he's too charming.

89
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,955
But if you go out, it's gonna make it
so much harder for me to hate him.

90
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,958
Well, you're just going to have to try.

91
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,128
All right. Joey?
Where are the Jell-0 shots?

92
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,298
I don't know.
Chandler's supposed to be passing them-

93
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,510
-Chandler.
-Hello-dee-lo.

94
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,263
Well, somebody's feeling better.

95
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,766
-Stick out your tongue.
-Take off your shirt.

96
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,397
-Oh, my.
-Oh, my God.

97
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,191
How many of these did you have?
These are pure vodka.

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,944
Yeah, Jell-0 just like Mom used to make.

99
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,365
The most unbelievable thing
happened to me today.

100
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,700
-Hi.
-Hi.

101
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,911
I'm having lunch at Monica's
and this guy starts talking to me...

102
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,247
...and he works for a buyer
at Bloomingdale's...

103
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,751
...and there's an opening in his department.
So I gave him my phone number...

104
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,920
...and he's gonna call me this weekend
to see if he can get me an interview.

105
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,256
-Wow. Ha, ha.
-I know.

106
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,759
What, so this guy's helping you
for no apparent reason?

107
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,260
Uh-huh.

108
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,597
And he's a total stranger?

109
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,017
Yeah. His name is, urn, Mark something.

110
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,896
Ah. Sounds like Mark Something
wants to have some sex.

111
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,940
What?

112
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,111
I'm just saying, why else would he just
swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?

113
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,072
To be nice?

114
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:31,076
Hey, Joey, are men ever nice
to strange women for no reason?

115
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,744
-No, only for sex.
-Thank you.

116
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,042
So did you tell Mark Something
about me?

117
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,505
I didn't have to, because I was wearing
my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board...

118
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,839
...and ringing my bell.

119
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,383
Ah. Uh-huh.

120
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,804
Joey! Happy birthday!

121
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,764
Hey!

122
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,727
Okay, how many of that girl
are you seeing?

123
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,191
How hammered are you? Huh?
These are Joey's sisters.

124
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,818
Hi, Joey's sisters.

125
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,528
-Hey.
-Hey. Hey.

126
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,238
What are we drinking over here?

127
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,616
Oh, well, I have a vodka
and cranberry juice.

128
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:12,867
No kidding?

129
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,746
That's the exact same drink I made myself
right after I shot my husband.

130
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,041
Wow.

131
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,585
Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.

132
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,005
What are you doing?

133
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,800
I'm taking my ex-girlfriend
off my speed dialer.

134
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,176
Aw.

135
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,429
No, no, no, it's a good thing.

136
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,599
Why must we dial so speedily anyway?
Why must we rush through life?

137
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:41,271
Why can't we savor the precious moments?
Those are some huge breasts you have.

138
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,857
-Hi.
-Hi.

139
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:49,195
Yeah, heh. So, um, I heard about
this Mark guy that Rachel met today.

140
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,115
-Oh, yeah, isn't that great?
-Oh, yeah.

141
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,160
So, uh, yeah, pretty good.
He sounds like a nice, good guy.

142
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,496
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy.

143
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,458
I mean, you know what?
When he left, I actually used the phrase...

144
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,626
..."homina, homina, homina."

145
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,547
That's excellent.

146
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,553
So he's just a nice guy.

147
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,974
You really think this Mark doesn't want
anything in exchange for helping you?

148
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,019
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers
with him.

149
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,979
But, you know, that's true of any job.

150
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,068
Uh-oh.

151
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,277
How you feeling?

152
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,571
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore...

153
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,115
...because I drank it.

154
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,746
Where'd you get to? We lost you
after you opened up all the presents.

155
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:44,334
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room,
and not alone.

156
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,543
Woo-hoo.

157
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,753
-Really?
-Aah.

158
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,547
No "woo-hooing." No "woo-hooing."

159
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,633
Why, what happened?

160
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,721
I fooled around with Joey's sister.

161
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,601
-Well, that's not the worst part.
-What is the worst part?

162
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,812
I can't remember which sister.

163
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,690
You see what men do?
Don't tell me men are nice.

164
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,567
This is men.

165
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,489
Are you insane?

166
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,617
Joey's gonna kill you.
He's actually going to kill you dead.

167
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,911
Okay. You don't think I thought of that?

168
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,706
-How can you not know which one?
-I mean, that's unbelievable.

169
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,875
-I mean, was it Gina?
-Which one is Gina?

170
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,211
The dark, big hair,
with the airplane earrings.

171
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,421
No, no, no, that's not Gina, that's Dina.

172
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,675
See? You can't tell
which is which either. Blah.

173
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,847
We didn't fool around with any of them.
Blah. Blah.

174
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,811
Veronica. Look, it's gotta be Veronica.
The girl in the red skirt.

175
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,355
I definitely stuck my tongue
down her throat.

176
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,525
That was me.

177
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,406
Oh. When I've been drinking,
sometimes I tend to get overly friendly.

178
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,241
-And I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

179
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,869
-That's all right.
-That's okay.

180
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,666
Can I talk to you for a second?

181
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,420
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey.

182
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,506
Come on.

183
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:18,261
Why can't we talk in here,
with witnesses?

184
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,723
-I just got off the phone with my sister.
-Uh, which one?

185
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,391
-Mary Angela.
-Mary Angela.

186
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,644
-Yeah.
-Now, which one is she again?

187
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,314
Ask Chandler.
He's the one who fooled around with her.

188
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,026
She told me you said
you could really fall for her.

189
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:37,280
Now, is that true, or are you just
getting over Janice by groping my sister?

190
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,452
It's gotta be the first one.

191
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,621
Really?

192
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,581
That's great.

193
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,376
You and my sister, sitting in a tree.

194
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,671
Yep, I'm in a tree.

195
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,384
Did he call? Did Mark call?

196
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,845
No, honey, I'm sorry.
But the weekend's not over yet.

197
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,101
Oh, my God. Is that Phoebe?

198
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,520
-Guess they're back from their date.
-Ah.

199
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,652
Music. Very nice.

200
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,322
Uh-huh. Oh.

201
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,953
Oh, my God.

202
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,415
So how are you?

203
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,586
-I am good. I finished my book.
-Oh, yeah? What's it about?

204
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,713
I don't remember.
Do you wanna take a walk?

205
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,382
Yeah, I do.

206
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,136
"Dear Mary Angela:

207
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,013
Hi, how's it going?

208
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,641
This is the hardest letter
I've ever had to write."

209
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,353
What the hell's the matter with you?
How do you think Joey's gonna react...

210
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,231
...when he finds out
you blew off his sister with a letter?

211
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:56,693
That's the part where you tell him
that I moved to France...

212
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,987
...when actually I'll be in Cuba.

213
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,031
All right, look, look,
you've got to do this yourself, okay?

214
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,367
In person. At least you know her name.

215
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,245
You just go to the house
and you ask for Mary Angela, okay?

216
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,539
When whichever one she is
comes to the door...

217
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,833
...take her for a walk,
you let her down easy.

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,084
Okay.

219
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,879
What if Mary Angela comes to the door
and I ask for Mary Angela?

220
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,674
Where in Cuba?

221
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,230
Joey, what-? What are you doing here?

222
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,441
Waiting for my grandma
to finish my laundry.

223
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,734
What about you?

224
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,862
Uh, I'm here to see Mary Angela.

225
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,449
You are so the man. Come on.

226
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,036
Now, look, listen. Listen.

227
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,205
You gotta be cool, because my grandma
doesn't know about you two.

228
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,915
You do not wanna tick her off.

229
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:57,378
She was, like, the sixth person
to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.

230
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,047
Yeah.

231
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,298
Where's Mary Angela?

232
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,843
-She's right in there.
-Okay.

233
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,056
Hey, Chandler.

234
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,688
I can't believe Mark didn't call.
It's Sunday night and he didn't call.

235
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,899
Bummer.

236
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,486
Yeah, right. Look at you.
You're practically giddy.

237
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,197
No, I'm genuinely sorry
the Mark thing didn't work out.

238
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:28,618
Look, Rach,
I want only good things for you.

239
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,120
Wait a minute.
Why don't you just call Mark?

240
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,125
Who says you have to sit here
and wait for him?

241
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,002
You've got to make stuff happen.

242
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,798
Yeah, but you don't
wanna seem too pushy.

243
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,342
Honey, it's not pushy.
He gave her his home number.

244
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,096
Wha-? He gave you his home number,
as in, like, to his home?

245
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:52,141
Yeah. And you don't mind if I call,
because you only want good things for me.

246
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,145
That's right, good things.
That is what I said.

247
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:03,111
Ahem. Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green.

248
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:09,367
Ha, ha. Oh, no. Don't you apologize.

249
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,618
Yeah, I'll hold.

250
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,578
He left my number at work.

251
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,290
He was gonna get it, but he was helping
his niece with her report on the pioneers.

252
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,961
-Aw.
-That is so made up.

253
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:24,298
Yeah. Oh, my God. Tomorrow?
That's- No, it's perfect.

254
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:28,386
Oh, God. Thank you so much.
Great. Bye.

255
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,012
Oh! I got the interview.

256
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,931
-Oh, yay!
-There you go.

257
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,226
He even offered to meet me for lunch
and prep me for it.

258
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,145
-Oh, that is amazing.
-Yeah.

259
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,606
Well, if I know Mark, and I think I do...

260
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,735
-...I'd expect nothing less.
-I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear.

261
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,322
High collar and baggy pants say,
"I'm a pro."

262
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,450
Yeah, right. Okay, I'll see you guys later.

263
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,660
-Woo-hoo!
-Okay.

264
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,912
You go get them.

265
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,166
What did I do to you?
Did I hurt you in some way?

266
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,336
-What?
-"Why don't you call him?"

267
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,839
Well, thank you very much.
Now he's gonna prep her.

268
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:10,219
You know, prep her, as in what you do
before you surgically remove the boyfriend.

269
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,637
Are you crazy?

270
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:15,266
Oh, am I? Am I? Am I out of my mind?
Am I losing my senses?

271
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,313
This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend
out for a meal.

272
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,523
Ross, you know, this isn't even about you.

273
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,443
This is about Rachel
and something happening for her.

274
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,361
-Uh-huh.
-Even if you're right.

275
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,698
What if he wants to sleep with her?
Does that mean he gets to?

276
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,825
-No, but-
-I mean, don't you trust her?

277
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,243
Well, yeah-

278
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,954
Then get over yourself. Grow up.

279
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,252
You grow up.

280
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,683
This tiramisu is excellent.

281
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,145
-Did you make it, Mary Angela?
-No, I did.

282
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,065
Well, it's yummy.

283
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,945
So, uh, Mary Angela, do you like it?

284
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,364
Of course. It's her favorite.

285
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,409
So, um, hmm....

286
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,371
Mary Angela,
what's your second favorite?

287
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,164
More of Grandma's tiramisu.

288
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,125
Oh, would you just please...

289
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,712
...give me your recipe,
because this is great.

290
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,589
It's top-notch.

291
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,884
-That dies with me.
-So will I.

292
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,721
Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom.

293
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,516
Oh, no, I was just squinting.
That doesn't mean anything.

294
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,226
Just do it.

295
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,150
Will you excuse me? I have to, um....

296
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,955
Hey-

297
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,541
Finally. I thought we'd never be alone.

298
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,001
Can I just tell you something?

299
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,753
I have not stopped thinking about you
since the party.

300
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,047
Mm. Mm.

301
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,968
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.
Whoa.

302
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,803
Uh- Ahem.

303
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,805
I just got out of a relationship.

304
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,934
And I'm not really in a....
In a commitment kind of place.

305
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,185
So? Me neither.

306
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,689
God, Mary Angela was right.
You do have the softest lips.

307
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,399
Aah.

308
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:32,320
-You're not Mary Angela?
-No. I'm Mary Therese.

309
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,822
This is so bad.

310
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,825
If you're not Mary Angela, then who is?

311
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,744
I am.

312
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,997
Oh, it's so bad.

313
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,834
-Joey!
-No Joey. No Joey. No Joey.

314
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,170
-Joey.
-What's going on?

315
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,340
You're it. Now run and hide.

316
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,675
It's no big deal.

317
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,387
Chandler was just kissing me
because he thought I was Mary Angela.

318
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,724
What? How could you do that?
How could you think she was Mary Angela?

319
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,852
I wasn't sure
which one Mary Angela was.

320
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,730
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

321
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,983
I was really drunk,
and you guys all look really similar.

322
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,234
I say punch him, Joey.

323
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,070
-Yeah, punch him.
-Yeah, kick him.

324
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,529
We should all calm down...

325
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,908
...because, you know,
your brother's not gonna punch me.

326
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,993
Are you?

327
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,953
Well, that is usually what I would do.

328
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,498
But I never thought
you'd be on the receiving end.

329
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,333
How could you do this?

330
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,877
Joey, if you wanna punch me, go ahead.
I deserve it.

331
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:34,423
But I just want you to know that I would
never soberly hurt you or your family.

332
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,509
You're my best friend.

333
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,428
And I would never do anything
like this ever again.

334
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,431
So what?

335
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,518
-I say punch him. Punch him.
-Yeah, punch him.

336
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,355
-Come on, punch him.
-No. No. I'm not gonna punch Chandler.

337
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,816
-I'll do it.
-No, you won't.

338
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,027
Look, he knows he did a terrible thing,
and I believe him.

339
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,905
He's sorry.
But you got one more apology to make.

340
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,741
All right?
You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.

341
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,786
-Okay. Absolutely. You got it.
-All right.

342
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,464
-Cookie, now you can punch him.
-What?

343
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,974
-Hey.
-Hi.

344
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,267
What are you doing here?

345
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,186
You know,
this building's on my paper route, so....

346
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,021
-Oh. Hi.
-Hi.

347
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,231
How did it go?

348
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,067
Oh, well, the woman I interviewed with
was pretty tough...

349
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,236
...but, you know,
thank God Mark coached me.

350
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,448
Once I started talking about the fall line,
she got all happy.

351
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,492
-I'm so proud of you.
-Me too.

352
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,578
Listen, I'm, uh....

353
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,083
I'm sorry I've been so crazy
and jealous and....

354
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,586
It's just, I like you a lot, so....

355
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,795
I know.

356
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,005
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

357
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,214
-Rachel.
-Yeah?

358
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,632
-Hi. Hi.
-Hi, Mark.

359
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,136
I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you.
You got it. You got the job.

360
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,679
-What?
-Oh! I did?

361
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:04,930
Yes.

362
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,307
-Aah!
-Oh, my God!

363
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,018
-Congratulations....
-Oh! Wow.

364
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,524
-So, Phoebe.
-Hmm?

365
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,817
How was your date?

366
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,028
Oh, well, you know. Ha, ha.

367
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,655
Yeah, I do know.

368
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,240
Ick. You were eavesdropping?

369
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:27,286
Eavesdropping?
Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.

370
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,498
Oh, I'm sorry.

371
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:35,961
But I really like this guy,
and I think he really happens to like me.

372
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,171
-Aw.
-Yay.

373
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,846
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo stick
and he really likes it.

374
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,602
Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.

375
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,190
All right, that's it.
He cannot do this to Phoebe.

376
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:59,610
This guy's gonna get the butt-kicking
of a lifetime.

377
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,279
But is he a big guy?

378
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,572
We'll all go. Come on.

379
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,450
-Thanks, you guys. Thank you.
-Don't worry.

380
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:10,162
God. I hope they kick his ass.

381
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,830
Honey, I'm sorry.

382
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,666
You know, if it's any consolation...

383
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,669
...he really did sound
like he was having more fun with you.
