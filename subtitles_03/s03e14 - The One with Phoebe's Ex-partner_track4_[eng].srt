1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:13,931
<i>'Cause every time I see your face</i>

2
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:18,101
<i>I can't help but fall from grace</i>

3
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,853
Wow. This girl's good.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,857
Oh, yeah, a song with rhyming words.
Ooh, I never thought of that before.

5
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,236
I like her.

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,279
Why? Because she can sing
and play guitar...

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,657
...and do both at the same time?

8
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,494
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for
from these people.

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,413
Look at you, all jealous.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,667
Yeah, Pheebs, come on.
You two have completely different styles.

11
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:47,881
You know, she's more...you know?
And you're more:

12
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,803
<i>Say you'll stay beside me</i>

13
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,019
Okay. See? See?
Everybody else is happy she's done.

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,649
Okay, my next song's called:

15
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,694
"Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say?
I Really Loved When We Were...

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,322
...Singing Partners and I Shouldn't
Have Left You That Way."

17
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:18,328
Oh, no. One of those
look-for-the-hidden-meaning songs.

18
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,756
Hey, Phoebe.

19
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,007
Hey, Leslie.

20
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,717
How'd you know I'd be here?

21
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,553
I ran into Vlad at the place
where they sell the big fish...

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,722
...and he said you played here a lot, so....

23
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,807
All right. I have to go to the bathroom.

24
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,060
But if the place with the big fish
comes up again...

25
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:27,105
...I'd like to know whether that's several
big fish or just one big fish.

26
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,442
So Phoebe tells us you write jingles.

27
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,362
Actually, I said she abandoned me
to write jingles.

28
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,074
Uh, anything we might've heard of?

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,284
Uh, yeah, urn....

30
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,662
<i>Home is never far away</i>

31
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,499
<i>Home is Home star Stew</i>

32
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,295
Yeah, but I don't do that anymore.
I got kind of sick of it.

33
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:54,925
And then I couldn't come up with
anything good, so they fired me.

34
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,635
Hmm, bummer.

35
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,971
Well, you know, I was just....

36
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:04,643
Um, I was just thinking
and just hoping that...

37
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,312
...maybe you'd want
to get back together?

38
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,314
No, but thanks.

39
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,900
Oh, come on, Phoebe.
Would you just think about it?

40
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,611
Okay.

41
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,113
No, but thanks.

42
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,077
Okay, uh....

43
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,995
See you, Pheebs.

44
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,126
Wow. That was kind of brutal.

45
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,878
Well, okay.
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

46
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,632
All right? Once you betray me,
I become like the Ice Woman.

47
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,971
You know, I'm just very cold,
hard, unyielding.

48
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,558
You know, nothing, nothing
can penetrate this icy exterior.

49
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,017
Can I have a tissue, please?

50
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,310
Oh, yes.

51
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,734
Is someone in there?

52
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,654
No. This is just part
of a daredevil game...

53
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,658
...that I play called "Wait Until
the Last Moment Before I Burst and Die."

54
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,162
Jeez, man. Did you fall-? Hi.

55
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,874
So, uh, did you? Did you fall high?

56
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,252
Someone was in the ladies' room.
I couldn't wait.

57
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,172
-I left the lid up for you, though.
-Ha, ha.

58
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,092
You know what, uh, Gunther?
Go, uh- Go ahead.

59
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,428
I'm talking to, uh....

60
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,848
This is the part
where you say your name.

61
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,477
-Ginger.
-Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....

62
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,358
-Don't you have to use the bathroom?
-No.

63
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,361
No, I just, uh-
I'd rather, uh, talk to you.

64
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,989
Yes, I do.

65
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,075
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.

66
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,536
Someone in here.

67
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,165
-Where's Chandler?
-He can't make it.

68
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,251
He said he had to go back
to his, uh, job to do, uh-

69
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,878
Uh-oh.

70
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,088
Joey?

71
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,217
Joey Tribbiani?

72
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,141
Joey, I can see you, okay?

73
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,727
You're hiding behind the coats.

74
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,448
Close one. Hen.

75
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,830
-Hi.
-Hi, sweetie.

76
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,958
Hello.

77
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,376
Hey, Ross.

78
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,961
Uh-huh.

79
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,464
-I've got some bad news.
-What?

80
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,967
I can get a quick bite,
but I have to come back here.

81
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,428
Come on, sweetie. You've worked late
every night for the past two weeks.

82
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,306
-What is it this time?
-It's kind of my fault. I quit today.

83
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,392
But work comes first.

84
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,062
Oh, hey. But that's sad about you, though.
What happened?

85
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,691
What happened? Burn out?
Burn all out, did you?

86
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,736
No, he's leaving for a better job.

87
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,073
Oh, well, that's great.
So I guess this is, uh, goodbye then.

88
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,741
Goodbye. Ha, ha.

89
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,704
-Okay, then.
-Okay.

90
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,998
Well, we're gonna
miss you around here.

91
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,208
Yeah, me too.

92
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,630
-So see you on Saturday.
-Yeah, you bet.

93
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,848
Ugh.

94
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,360
Now, you know those
are a delicacy in India.

95
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,532
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again
to see if we can get back together.

96
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,786
It's like the 20th time today.
Yeah, good luck, Leslie.

97
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,623
Wow. She must've hurt you
pretty bad, huh?

98
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,876
Well, yeah.
You know, we were best friends...

99
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:01,713
...ever since we were little.
Our moms worked on the barge together.

100
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,508
You two must've been so cute
running around on a barge.

101
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,844
You never run on a barge.

102
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,098
-Hey.
-Hey.

103
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,683
Is, uh-? Is Chandler around?

104
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,561
No, um, he met some girl
at the coffeehouse.

105
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,313
-Ooh.
-Yeah. Ginger something.

106
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,023
No.

107
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,903
No, no. Uh, are you sure it wasn't
something that sounded liked Ginger?

108
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,655
Like, uh, "Gingeer"?

109
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,699
No, it was Ginger.

110
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,035
I remember because
when he told me, I said:

111
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,412
<i>The movie star</i>

112
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,456
Oh, man.

113
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,708
That's the girl I was hiding from.

114
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,544
When she finds out he's my roommate,
she'll tell him what I did.

115
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,757
-What did you do?
-Oh. Oh, no, no. I can't....

116
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,094
I can't tell you that.
It's like the most awful, horrible thing...

117
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,222
-...I've ever done in my whole life.
-You know what? Don't tell us.

118
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,016
We'll wait till Chandler gets home
because it'll be more fun.

119
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,518
All right.

120
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,563
Okay, it was, like, four years ago.

121
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,775
Okay, Ginger and I had gone out
a few times. Then one weekend...

122
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,443
...we went to her dad's cabin...

123
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,698
...just me, her and her
annoying little dog, Pepper. Heh.

124
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,826
Well, that night I cooked
this really romantic dinner-

125
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,245
You gave her food poisoning.

126
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,871
I wish. No.

127
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,626
After dinner, me, her and Pepper
all fell asleep in front of the fire.

128
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,588
Well, I woke up in the middle of the night
and I saw that the fire was dying out...

129
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,092
...so I picked up a log and threw it on.

130
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,929
Or at least what I thought was a log.

131
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,724
Oh, my God.
You threw Pepper on the fire.

132
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,309
I wish.

133
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,606
See, I guess another thing I probably
should've told you about Ginger...

134
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,651
...is that she kind of has a, uh...

135
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,069
...artificial leg.

136
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,827
Oh, my God.

137
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,831
Joey. What did you do after
you threw her leg on the fire?

138
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,625
I ran.

139
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,262
Well, that's the best kiss I've had...

140
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,139
...with anybody I met in a men's room.

141
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,975
Actually, me too.

142
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,645
Oh. Foot in a puddle.
Foot all in the puddle.

143
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,148
Oh, damn. I hate that.

144
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,150
We're gonna have to get you
out of those shoes.

145
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,526
Oh, don't worry about it.

146
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,113
-No, really. You're gonna freeze.
-No, I'm not.

147
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,368
Huh. You're not?
What do you got, a bionic foot?

148
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,580
Someday. Maybe.

149
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,675
Funny book?

150
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:58,139
Hmm? Oh, no, no. I'm just thinking about
something funny I heard today.

151
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:02,227
Um, Mark saying, "I'll see you Saturday."

152
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,730
Yeah, at the lecture.

153
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,316
I told you that last week.
You said you didn't mind.

154
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:12,779
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not the lecture, uh, I mind. Urn....

155
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,282
Oh, please tell me it's not because
I'm going with Mark.

156
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,619
-Well-
-Oh, my God. Ross.

157
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,997
Well, I'm sorry, but- Look,
if you're not working with him anymore...

158
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,124
...why do you still have to do stuff
with him?

159
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,085
Because he's my friend.

160
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:31,464
Okay. But do you really need
another friend? I mean....

161
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:37,011
Okay. Well, if I stop playing with Joey
and Chandler, can I play with Mark?

162
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,223
Is that funny?
Am I suppose to be laughing?

163
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,060
I don't know. You thought
"See you Saturday" was funny.

164
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,563
Look, honey, Mark is in fashion, okay?

165
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,399
I like having a friend
that I can share this stuff with.

166
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,484
You guys would never
go to a lecture with me.

167
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,573
I would love to go with you.

168
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,866
-Really?
-Yeah.

169
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,661
Hey, I have clothes. I even pick them out.

170
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,123
I mean, for all you know,
I could be a fashion...

171
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,958
...monger.

172
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,258
Okay. Honey, I would love for you
to go with me.

173
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,926
What?

174
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,971
What should I wear?
Now I'm all nervous.

175
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,151
You know, they say,
"A watched pot never beeps."

176
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,448
It's, you know, ahem-
It's been a couple hours...

177
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,783
...and she hasn't called.

178
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,536
Not that I even care. I don't.

179
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,539
Phoebe, why don't you just call her?

180
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,791
You obviously want to.

181
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,960
You think you know me so well.

182
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,963
-Well, don't you wanna?
-Yeah.

183
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,843
-Okay, so I do know you.
-That's what I said.

184
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,598
-Well, so?
-I can't.

185
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,059
I can't. She dumped me.

186
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,770
I mean, I totally trusted her,
and then one day it was like:

187
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,022
"Okay, bye, Pheebs." Gone.

188
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,361
You know what the saddest part is?
When we were playing together...

189
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:20,865
...that was like the most fun
I've ever had in, like, all my lives.

190
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:27,872
<i>My favorite shoes So good
to me, I wear them every day</i>

191
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:33,002
<i>Down at the heel, holes in the toes
Don't care what people say</i>

192
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,005
<i>My feet's best friend
Pals to the end</i>

193
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,841
<i>With them, I'm one hot chickie</i>

194
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,553
<i>Though late one night
Not much light</i>

195
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,307
<i>I stepped in something icky</i>

196
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,938
<i>Sticky shoes, sticky shoes</i>

197
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,649
<i>Always make me smile</i>

198
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:59,862
<i>Sticky shoes, sticky shoes
Next time I'll</i>

199
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,825
<i>Avoid the</i>

200
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,702
<i>Pile</i>

201
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:18,715
We're beginning to see a lot
of layering of sheer fabrics and colors.

202
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,218
For instance, a sheer navy blouse
over a pink....

203
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,971
I'm really glad we came.

204
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,768
You're so pretty.

205
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,898
I love you.

206
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,196
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

207
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,408
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

208
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,536
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

209
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:52,915
<i>It's not your fault</i>

210
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,001
Wow, that's great.

211
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,171
-Oh, yeah?
-You know, you could totally sell this.

212
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:02,258
It'd be perfect for, like, um,
a kitty-litter campaign.

213
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,344
A jingle? No, no, no.

214
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,180
Why not? You make a ton of money.

215
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,850
Okay, if I was in this for the money,
I'd be a millionaire by now, you know?

216
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,979
You gotta get out
of that jingle-head, sweetie.

217
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,775
Ugh. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry.

218
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,068
-That's okay.
-Okay.

219
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,196
All right, I'm gonna play a song now
that's really, really sad.

220
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,407
-Okay.
-Okay, it's called "Magician Box Mix-Up."

221
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,624
Oversized bracelets,
oversized earrings...

222
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,628
...oversizing of accessories in general
is very popular now.

223
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,516
-Hi.
-Hey.

224
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,559
Oh, can I borrow this?
My milk's gone bad.

225
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,061
Oh, I hate that.

226
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,314
I once had a thing of half-and-half.
Stole my car.

227
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,236
So how was your date with Ginger?

228
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,740
Great. Ahem. It was great. She's, uh....

229
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,868
She's great. Great looking,
great personality. She's greatness.

230
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,039
Sounds like she's got the, uh...

231
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,333
...whole package.

232
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,379
-Joey told you about the leg, huh?
-Uh-huh.

233
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,175
Oh, God. It freaked me out.
Okay? I know it shouldn't have, but it did.

234
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,178
I like her. I don't wanna stop seeing her,
but every so often, it's like:

235
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,848
"Hey, you know what?
Where's your leg?"

236
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,020
I mean, I'm the smallest person
in the world, aren't I?

237
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,189
I'm the smallest person in the world.

238
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,691
Morning.

239
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,694
Actually, he's the smallest person
in the world.

240
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,869
Heard about the leg-burning, huh?

241
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,998
It came up.

242
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,835
Ahem, listen, I, uh-
I know it's a long shot, but...

243
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,422
...by any chance,
did she find that funny?

244
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,803
So I nodded off a little.

245
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,056
"Nodded off'? Ross, you were snoring.

246
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,436
My father's boat didn't make
that much noise when it hit rocks.

247
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,147
Come on. Forty-five minutes.

248
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:25,485
Forty-five minutes, the man talked
about strappy-backed dresses.

249
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:31,407
Well, okay, how about four hours
in a freezing museum auditorium...

250
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,910
...listening to Professor Pitstains
and his:

251
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,663
"Hey, everybody. Remember that thing
that's been dead for a gazillion years?

252
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,875
Well, here's a little bone
we didn't know it had."

253
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:48,633
First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

254
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,427
And second of all,
that little bone proved that...

255
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,972
...that particular dinosaur had wings
but didn't fly.

256
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,266
Okay, you know what I just heard?

257
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:01,395
Blah, blah, blah.

258
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:06,609
You know what? A hundred million people
went to see a movie about what I do.

259
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:11,113
I wonder how many people would go see
a movie called <i>Jurassic Parka.</i>

260
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,282
Oh, that is so-

261
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,743
No, no, no.
A bunch of out-of-control jackets...

262
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,245
...take over an island.

263
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,296
You know, if what I do is so lame...

264
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,716
...then why did you insist on coming
with me this morning?

265
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,052
Huh? Was it so
I just wouldn't go with Mark?

266
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,387
No.

267
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,391
I.... I wanted to be with you.

268
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,519
I don't know. I feel like lately-

269
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,437
I feel like you're slipping away from me...

270
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,232
...with this new job
and all these new people.

271
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,068
And you've got this
whole other life going on.

272
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,404
I know it's dumb...

273
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,574
...but I just hate that I'm not a part of it.

274
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,872
It's not dumb.

275
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,419
But maybe it's okay
that you're not a part of it.

276
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,753
You know what I mean?

277
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:15,344
I mean, it's like I like that you're not
involved in that part of my life.

278
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,972
That's a little clearer.

279
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,642
Honey, see, it doesn't mean
that I don't love you...

280
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,770
...because I do. I love you.
I love you so much.

281
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,648
But my work, it's for me, you know?

282
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,067
I'm out there on my own,
and I'm doing it.

283
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,363
And it's scary,
but I love it because it's mine.

284
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,575
But I mean, is that okay?

285
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,869
Sure. Ha, ha.

286
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,130
You're thinking about my leg,
aren't you?

287
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,132
No, no.

288
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,052
Actually, I forgot.
What is the deal with that again?

289
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,138
Look, it's okay if it bothers you.

290
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,141
I mean, the only thing I need to know
is how much it bothers you...

291
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,643
...because I don't like wasting my time.

292
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,937
Am I wasting my time?

293
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:11,275
-No. No, I don't think so.
-Okay.

294
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,820
It's just like anything else.
You just have to get used to it.

295
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,334
What's that?

296
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,712
That's my nubbin.

297
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,760
What's a nubbin?

298
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,099
It's kind of a, uh-
A third-nipple kind of thing.

299
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,185
Do you have three nipples?

300
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,938
Well, you know, two regulars, ahem...

301
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,441
...and, uh, one that barely qualifies.

302
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,114
-Uh, what?
-Nothing. I-

303
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,449
I just remembered. I have to leave.

304
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,036
You, uh-? You have to leave?
Now? How come?

305
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,996
Well, it's nubbin. Nothing.

306
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:11,377
Um, you know what?
I'll see you later. Okay.

307
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,129
Uh....

308
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,965
Ew.

309
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,637
Oh. I thought you weren't coming.

310
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,306
-Where were you?
-Come here. Come here.

311
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,059
Okay. Don't get mad, okay?

312
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,895
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad,
okay?

313
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:34,567
I played "Smelly Cat" for the people
at my old ad agency. They went nuts.

314
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,362
No, look. I told you that I didn't want you
to try and sell it...

315
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,699
...and you just big fat did it anyway.

316
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,661
God. You know what?
I think, five years ago...

317
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,497
...I probably would have done anything
to play with you.

318
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,460
But I can do it by myself, right?
And if I can't trust you, then just forget it.

319
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,462
No. No. I don't wanna forget it.

320
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,338
Okay, you know what?
You have to choose.

321
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,009
All right? If the most important thing
on the planet to you...

322
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:05,181
...is this cat-poopy thing,
then, okay, you can have "Smelly Cat."

323
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,391
But we won't be partners.

324
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,393
So what's it gonna be?

325
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,147
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat
Odor in the litter box?</i>

326
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:16,567
<i>Don't change your kitty.
Change your kitty litter.</i>

327
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,487
<i>It's not your fault</i>

328
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,533
-Sorry, Pheebs.
-Yeah.

329
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,202
You okay?

330
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,788
Yeah. I actually am. Yeah.

331
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,666
Because, you know, life's gonna
hand you all kinds of stuff.

332
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,961
You know, you learn your little lessons
and hopefully you grow.

333
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,255
You wanna hear a new song?

334
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,715
-Yeah.
-Oh, we'd love to.

335
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,091
Okay.

336
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,345
<i>Jingle bitch screwed me over</i>

337
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,140
<i>Go to hell, jingle whore</i>

338
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,353
Go to <i>hell, go to hell, go to hell</i>

339
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,064
That's all I have so far.

340
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,153
Well, hello.

341
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,198
-Where have you been?
-The doctor.

342
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,699
-Is everything okay?
-Oh, yes.

343
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,452
Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy.

344
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,874
Yep. Two nipples, no waiting.

345
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,710
Well. Just like Rachel in high school.

346
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,838
What?

347
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,801
Come on. Come on, I was kidding.
It was such an obvious joke.

348
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,886
That was an obvious joke.

349
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,055
And I didn't think of it.
Why didn't I think of it?

350
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,600
The source of all my powers.

351
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,604
Oh, dear God, what have I done?
