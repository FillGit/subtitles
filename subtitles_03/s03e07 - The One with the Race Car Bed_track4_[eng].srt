1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:06,298
So I told Carl, nobody, no matter
how famous their parents are...

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,926
...nobody is allowed
to climb on the dinosaur.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,428
But of course,
this went right in one ear....

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,348
<i>I love how he cares so much
about stuff.</i>

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:18,477
<i>If I squint, I can pretend he's Alan Alda.</i>

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,899
<i>Oh, good. Another dinosaur story.</i>

7
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,028
<i>When are those gonna become extinct?</i>

8
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,660
<i>If I was a superhero
who could fly and be invisible...</i>

9
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,079
<i>...that would be the best.</i>

10
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,294
<i>What does Rachel see in this guy?</i>

11
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,631
<i>I love Rachel.</i>

12
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,594
<i>I wish she was my wife.</i>

13
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,817
<i>Who's singing?</i>

14
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,997
Hey, when you guys were kids
and you played <i>Happy Days...</i>

15
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,876
-...who were you? I was always Richie.
-I was always Joanie.

16
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:10,297
Question: Was, uh, "Egg the Gellers"
the war cry of your neighborhood?

17
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,051
Ew, ew! It's the Mattress King.

18
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,886
-Don't look. Change the channel.
-Boo!

19
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,680
Wait. I want to see this.
After I divorce him...

20
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,975
...half of that kingdom
is gonna be mine.

21
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,228
<i>Despair fills the mattress showroom.</i>

22
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,315
<i>My kingdom is suddenly
without a queen.</i>

23
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,067
<i>I'm so depressed...</i>

24
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,818
<i>...I'm going to slash...</i>

25
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,112
<i>...my prices! Check it out!</i>

26
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:38,367
<i>599 for a California king.
499 for a pillow-top queen set.</i>

27
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,827
<i>I'm going medieval on prices.</i>

28
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,871
What a wank.

29
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:47,084
Oh, I cannot believe he's using
our divorce to sell mattresses.

30
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,421
I know. At 499 for a pillow-top queen,
who cares about the divorce?

31
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,924
Those babies will sell themselves.

32
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,887
And I'm appalled for you, by the way.

33
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,433
<i>I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.</i>

34
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:12,317
Okay. Okay, Daddy. We'll see you
tomorrow night. Okay, bye-bye.

35
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,278
-"We"?
-Ahem.

36
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:19,950
-are, uh, having dinner with my dad
tomorrow night. I hope that's okay.

37
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,411
Oh, shoot. Tomorrow's not good.

38
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,080
I'm supposed to, urn, fall off
the Empire State Building...

39
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,624
...and land on a bicycle
with no seat, so....

40
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,421
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.

41
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,632
Please. He refers to me as "Wet-Head."

42
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,261
Honey, he calls everybody
by a nickname.

43
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,723
Okay, look, I know. Just one dinner.
Please, one night. For me. Please?

44
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,725
I just want him to love you like I do.

45
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,854
All right. Well, not exactly like I do.

46
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,690
But if you do come to dinner...

47
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:55,235
...I'll love you like I do
in that black thing that you like.

48
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,362
I'll go.

49
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,493
-Fine.
-Thank you.

50
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,498
Hi, Gunther.

51
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,709
Yeah. We'll see.

52
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,337
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey.

53
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,089
-Hey. Hey.
-Guess what.

54
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,883
-I got a gig.
-Great.

55
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,595
See, that's why I can never be an actor.
Because I can't say "gig."

56
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,015
Yeah, I can't say "croissant."
Oh, my God.

57
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,810
-What's the part?
-It's not a part. No.

58
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,980
I'm teaching Acting for Soap Operas
at the Learning Extension.

59
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,398
Come on. That's great.

60
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,151
It's like my chance
to give something back...

61
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,487
...to the acting community.

62
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,907
You know, you're probably not allowed
to sleep with any of your students.

63
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,538
I know.

64
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,797
Ugh. I don't know, Monica.
It feels funny just being here.

65
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,758
I mean, if you buy a bed
from Janice's ex-husband...

66
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,676
...that's like betraying Chandler.

67
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,054
Not at these prices.

68
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,185
Hi.

69
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,105
You know, in England this car would be
on the other side of the store.

70
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,529
Whoosh.

71
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,407
Oh, oh, oh.

72
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,826
Phoebe, come here.

73
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,954
Ah, this is my new bed.

74
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,915
You gotta feel this bad boy.

75
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,210
Ugh. Monica, it still feels so weird,
you know?

76
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,878
Chandler's your friend. Oh.

77
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,589
Oh, my God.

78
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:45,387
Oh. All right, take this bed.
You can make other friends. Oh.

79
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,105
Good evening.

80
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,774
I am Mr. Tribbiani.

81
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,778
And I will be teaching
Acting for Soap Operas.

82
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,822
Now, um...

83
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:09,411
...on my first day as Dr. Drake
Ramoray on <i>Days of our Lives...</i>

84
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,333
...uh, ahem, I learned that
one of the most important things...

85
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,503
...in soap opera acting is reacting.

86
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,381
This does not mean acting again.

87
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,052
It means you don't have a line,
but someone else just did.

88
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,597
And it goes something like this. Ahem.

89
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,022
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

90
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,025
By the way, before I forget.
To work in soap operas...

91
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,236
...some of you are gonna have to become
much more attractive.

92
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,156
All right, moving right along....

93
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,870
-Hi.
-Hey.

94
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,665
-Oh! How was teaching last night?
-Oh, it was great. You get to say stuff like:

95
00:06:55,874 --> 00:07:00,420
"Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you.
I dismiss you."

96
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,298
-Oh, nice.
-Yeah.

97
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,800
Oh, and guess what.
I got an audition for <i>All My Children.</i>

98
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,969
-Oh, yay!
-Yeah, it's this great part.

99
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,679
This boxer named Nick.

100
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,599
And I'm so, so right for it, you know?
He's just like me...

101
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,601
...except that he's a boxer...

102
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,394
...and has an evil twin.

103
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,272
Oh.

104
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,276
Dum-datta-dum.

105
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,696
Hear ye, hear ye.
Delivery from the Mattress King.

106
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,742
You Miss Geller?

107
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,078
-Okay.
-Sign here.

108
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,039
-Ooh. Do I have a middle name?
-Mm-hm.

109
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,376
All right. Monica Felula...

110
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,294
...Geller.

111
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
It's that bedroom there.

112
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,219
Hey, Monica bought a bed
from the Mattress King?

113
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,722
Yeah. So please, please, please
don't say anything to Chandler.

114
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,684
-You want me to lie to Chandler?
-Is that a problem?

115
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,394
No.

116
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,147
Oh, hey, hey, Nick the boxer.
Let's see what you got.

117
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,066
-Yeah.
-All right, put them up. Come on.

118
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,652
-Hey, you're pretty good at this.
-Ha, ha.

119
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,946
Yeah, I had to learn.
I was staying at the Y...

120
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,740
...and some of the young men
weren't acting Christian enough.

121
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,204
Hey, now. Hey.

122
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,332
-Ow. And I'm bleeding. Okay, great.
-Oh, oh!

123
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,085
Wow. And I'm a vegetarian.

124
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,714
All right, I'm sorry.
We'll put some ice on it.

125
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,966
-Put your head back. Ooh.
-Okay. All right.

126
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,759
-I can't see.
-I have you.

127
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,052
Oh, God.

128
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,889
Which bedroom do you want it in,
Ms. Geller?

129
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,309
Oh. It's the compulsively neat one
by the window, okay?

130
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,103
Gotcha.

131
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,695
Hi, Daddy.

132
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,655
This is where they put us?

133
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,783
What? There was no table
available in the kitchen?

134
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,619
-Hello, baby.
-You remember Ross.

135
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,788
-Mm-hm.
-Nice to see you again, Dr. Green.

136
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,124
So.

137
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,007
-How's the library?
-Uh, museum.

138
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,344
-What happened to the library?
-There never was a library.

139
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,139
I mean, there are libraries.
It's just that I, urn-

140
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,808
I've never worked at one. Ha, ha.

141
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,605
You know what's really good here?

142
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,148
-The lobster.
-Mm.

143
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:29,569
-What do you say? Shall I just order three?
-Yeah, if you're really hungry. Ha, ha.

144
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,117
It was a joke. I made a joke.

145
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,246
Yeah, actually, Daddy,
Ross is allergic to lobster.

146
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,082
What kind of person's
allergic to lobster?

147
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,001
I guess the kind of person
that works in a library. Ha, ha.

148
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,836
-It's not-
-I know. It's a museum.

149
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,672
What, you're the only who can make a joke?
At least mine was funny.

150
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,841
Uh, waiter.

151
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,969
We will have two lobsters and a menu.

152
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,643
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat?

153
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,686
They found rust.

154
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,816
-Do you know what rust does to a boat?
-Gives it a nice antique-y look?

155
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:16,449
Rust is boat cancer, Ross.

156
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,076
Wow, I'm sorry.

157
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,578
When I was a kid, I lost a bike to that.
Ha, ha.

158
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,378
Excuse me for a moment,
will you, please?

159
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,880
I wanna say good night
to the Levines before we go.

160
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,715
Okay.

161
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,887
Honey, stop. It's not that bad.

162
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,014
Yeah. Oh.

163
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,725
Uh-oh. I think your dad
must have added wrong.

164
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,561
He only tipped, like, 4 percent.

165
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,563
Yeah. Ahem, that's Daddy.

166
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:51,317
"That's Daddy"? Doesn't it
bother you? You're a waitress.

167
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,111
Yes, it bothers me, Ross.

168
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,572
But, you know, if he was a regular
at the coffee house...

169
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,407
...I'd be serving him sneezers.

170
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,159
-So?
-So, Ross...

171
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,330
...I've bugged him about this
a million times. He's not gonna change.

172
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,875
Do you really serve people sneezers?

173
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,669
Ahem, well, urn, I don't.

174
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,672
-All right, kids. Ready?
-Yes.

175
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,633
-Thanks again, Dr. Green.
-Uh-huh.

176
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,182
Wait, wait, wait,
I think I forgot my receipt.

177
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,226
-Oh, you don't need that.
-Ahem, why not?

178
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:29,564
The carbon. It's messy. I mean,
gets on your fingers and causes...

179
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,274
...the, uh, night blindness.

180
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,279
What is this?

181
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,323
Who put a 20 down here?

182
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,742
-Huh?
-Oh, yeah, that would be me.

183
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,952
Um, I have- I have a problem.

184
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,288
I tip way too much, way, way too much.

185
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,540
-It's a sickness, really.
-Yeah, it is. It is.

186
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,793
-We have to do something about that.
-Excuse me.

187
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,046
You think I'm cheap?

188
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,506
-He didn't mean anything by that.
-Huh?

189
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,427
-He really didn't.
-Nothing I do means anything. Really.

190
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,932
This is nice. I pay $200 for dinner.

191
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,435
You put down 20 and you come out
looking like Mr. Big-Shot.

192
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,354
-You really wanna be Mr. Big-Shot?
-Oh.

193
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,400
Here. I'll tell you what. You pay the
whole bill, Mr. Big-Shot. All right?

194
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,615
Well, "Mr. Big-Shot"
is better than "Wet-Head."

195
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,327
Okay, some tricks of the trade.

196
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,829
Now, I've never been able to cry
as an actor...

197
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,582
...so if I'm in a scene
where I have to cry...

198
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,668
...I cut a hole in my pocket...

199
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,045
...take a pair of tweezers...

200
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,339
...and just start pulling.

201
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,011
Okay. Or uh....
Or let's say I want to convey...

202
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,098
...that I've, uh,
just done something evil.

203
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:49,269
Well, that would be your basic I've-got-a
fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-l-like-it.

204
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:57,026
No? Okay.
Let's say I've just gotten bad news.

205
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:02,365
Well, all I do there
is try and divide 232 by 13.

206
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,792
And that's how it's done.

207
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,336
Great soap opera acting
tonight, everybody.

208
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,255
Class dismissed.

209
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,967
-Hey, Mr. Trib.
-Hey.

210
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,177
Guess what. I got an audition.

211
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,806
Oh. One of my students got an audition.
I'm so proud.

212
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,893
I was wondering if you would consider
coaching me for it.

213
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,896
-Oh, you bet. What's the part?
-Oh, it's great.

214
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,899
It's a role on <i>All My Children.
</i>Nick the boxer.

215
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,910
Had to do it, didn't you?
You couldn't leave it alone.

216
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,582
Four percent, okay? I tip more than that
when there's a bug in my food.

217
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,626
Ross, tonight was about the two of you
getting along.

218
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,919
Ugh.

219
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,629
Would you see
my chiropractor already?

220
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,884
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went
to medical school in a mini-mall.

221
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,223
Hey, Pheebs. What are you doing?

222
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,226
I'm- I'm freaking out.

223
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,149
Monica kind of trusted me with something
and she shouldn't have.

224
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,277
All right, I haven't lived here in a while,
so I have to ask you.

225
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,821
Does Monica still turn the lights on
in her bedroom?

226
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,909
-Ahem. Yeah.
-I am so dead.

227
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,455
All right, look,
here's the bottom line, Ross.

228
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,166
This is fixable if we act fast, okay?

229
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,127
So I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow
and you can make nice.

230
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,547
Honey, I have tried to make nice.
It doesn't work.

231
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,883
Okay. Look,
I realize my father is difficult...

232
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,678
...but that's why you have got to be
the bigger man here.

233
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,557
Look, sweetie, I could be the bigger man.
I could be the biggest man.

234
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:55,436
I could be a big, huge, giant man
and it still wouldn't make a difference.

235
00:14:55,645 --> 00:15:00,024
Except that I could pick your father up
and say, "Like me. Like me, tiny doctor."

236
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,321
Okay, well, can't you just try it
one more time, Ross? For me? For me?

237
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,116
Rachel, one brunch
is not gonna solve anything.

238
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,576
You've gotta face it.
We're never gonna get along.

239
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,995
Okay, well, you are just going to have to.

240
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,749
Okay? I've already got a mother and father
who cannot stay in the same room.

241
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
I don't want to have
a separate room for you too.

242
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,170
Okay, okay. Okay.

243
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,673
I'll get the bagels.

244
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,263
What's this?

245
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,016
Isn't it cool? Vroom. Vroom.

246
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,727
This is not the bed I ordered.

247
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,690
I know. You must have won,
like, a contest or something.

248
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,734
Phoebe.

249
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,279
Why is this car in my bedroom?

250
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,531
I'm sorry, okay. I wasn't looking...

251
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,742
...and the store said that they won't
take it back because you signed for it.

252
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,704
-When did I sign for it?
-When I was you.

253
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,541
You know what? It's all Joey's fault
because he left his nose open.

254
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,752
Did you make brownies today?

255
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,505
Knock, knock.

256
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,675
Quick. Take off your dress.
He won't notice the bed.

257
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,721
Hey, I'm going for sushi.
Does anybody want, uh-?

258
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,601
Whoa. Somebody missed the off-ramp.

259
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,522
It's Monica's bed. What?

260
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,399
Okay....

261
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,235
It's a race car.

262
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,114
So? This has always been Monica's bed.
What, you're just noticing now?

263
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,908
How self-involved are you?

264
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,661
Okay, well, if this bed isn't new...

265
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,372
...then how come there's plastic
on the mattress?

266
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,460
Sometimes I have bad dreams.

267
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,007
Look...

268
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:52,720
...I just saw my best friend's brain
smeared across the canvas.

269
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,514
It's not gonna be me.

270
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,474
Not me.

271
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,227
Wow.

272
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,813
That was good. That was-

273
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,483
-Tweezers?
-No.

274
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,776
Oh, wow.

275
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,947
-That was really good.
-Thanks.

276
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,698
Any suggestions?

277
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,159
Hmm, I....

278
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,333
You told him to play the boxer gay?

279
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:30,299
Well, I might have said "super-gay."

280
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,261
You totally screwed him over.

281
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,472
Joey, you're this guy's teacher.
I mean, how could you do this?

282
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,724
Because, Monica, the guy's so good.

283
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,185
And I really, really want this part.

284
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,355
Well, if you really, really want it,
then it's okay.

285
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,567
-Hi, Daddy.
-Baby.

286
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:54,073
-Ross?
-Dr. Green, how are you?

287
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,411
Thanks for dinner last night.

288
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,205
Thank you for teaching me
a valuable lesson.

289
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,958
Nice hair. What did you do, swim here?

290
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,089
Okay, that's it. I can't take it anymore.

291
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,799
What, what? He's interested in you.

292
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:15,386
-He just wants to know how you got here.
-Oh, please.

293
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,181
-Sweetie, it's hopeless. I'm just gonna go.
-What? Ross.

294
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,350
-I'm sorry. It's just—
-Ross?

295
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,102
What's with the neck?

296
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,147
He's got this thing and I keep
telling him to go to my chiropractor.

297
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,232
You still going to that chiropractor?

298
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,776
That man couldn't get into med school
in Ixtapa.

299
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,238
Yeah, thank you.
That's what I keep saying.

300
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:38,200
Excuse me, ahem, Dr. Bobby happens
to be an excellent doctor.

301
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,579
Wait a minute. His name is Dr. Bobby?

302
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,082
-Well, that's his last name.
-And his first name.

303
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,543
He's Bobby Bobby?

304
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,796
Ahem. It's Robert Bobby.

305
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,214
Oh.

306
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,967
And, um, excuse me. He helps me.

307
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,346
-Oh. Please. Ask her how?
-What do you need help for?

308
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,806
With my alignment.
One leg's shorter than the other.

309
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,225
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah. Argue with that.

310
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,603
What? It's true.
My right leg is two inches shorter.

311
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,980
Come on, you're just tilting.

312
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,192
-Her legs are fine.
-I know that.

313
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,236
-So why do you let her go to a chiropractor?
-I'm sorry, "Let her"?

314
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,948
What can I do? She doesn't listen to me
about renter's insurance, either.

315
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,993
Wait a minute.
You don't have renter's insurance?

316
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,081
-No. Ahem.
-So, what if somebody steals something?

317
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,919
How you gonna run after him
with one leg shorter than the other?

318
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,385
Hey, would you, uh-?
Would you like some juice?

319
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,970
-I'd love some juice.
-Okay.

320
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,141
Well, this is going so well.
Did you see us? Did you see?

321
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,894
Yeah, honey. I was standing right there.

322
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,772
Why don't you tell him about the mole
I haven't gotten checked?

323
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,273
Excellent.

324
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,239
There will come a time
in each of your careers...

325
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:02,493
...when you'll have a chance to screw over
another soap opera actor.

326
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,956
I had such an opportunity
in the recent present.

327
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,460
And I'm ashamed to say...

328
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,254
...that I took it.

329
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:18,634
I advised a fellow actor to play a role...

330
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,554
...homosexually.

331
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,975
Yeah.

332
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,562
We both auditioned for the part and, uh...

333
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,982
...as it turned out...

334
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,401
...they....

335
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,030
They liked the stupid gay thing
and cast him.

336
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,993
And now...

337
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,079
...he's got a two-year contract...

338
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,583
...opposite Susan Lucci...

339
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,919
...the first lady of daytime television.

340
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,172
And me?

341
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,468
Me, I'm stuck here teaching
a bunch of people...

342
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,971
...most of whom are too ugly
to even be on TV.

343
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,934
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

344
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,321
Thank you.

345
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,202
-Uh, may I help you?
-Yes, hi.

346
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,788
I'm the lady who got stuck
with the race-car bed.

347
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:33,375
Look, it's like I told you.
There's nothing I can do.

348
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,838
You signed for it.
"Monica Felula Geller."

349
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,716
All right, jester man, look,
we wanna see the king.

350
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,843
Nobody sees the king.

351
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,930
Okay. I'm talking to the king.

352
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,098
Hey, you can't go back there.

353
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,733
Oh, my God.

354
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,707
Hey, watch it, lady.

355
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,924
Hey, good-looking.

356
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,561
All right, I'll leave.

357
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,980
My bed's so boring.
