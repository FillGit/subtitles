1
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,464
-Hey.
-Hey.

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,633
Hey.

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,428
So, what happened?
Did a forest tick you off?

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,347
No.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,475
You know how we're always saying
we need a place for the mail.

6
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,480
Yeah.

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,190
Well, I started building one.

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:27,069
But then I decided to take it
to the next step.

9
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,572
You're building a post office?

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,701
No, an entertainment unit,
with a mail cubby built right in.

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,413
-It's a one-day job, max.
-Okay.

12
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,042
My word, those are snug.

13
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,088
Oh, yeah. These are my old work pants.

14
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,465
Sergio Valente.

15
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,811
Power saw kind of got away
from me there.

16
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,364
-Hey, Pheebs.
-Hey.

17
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,659
-Any sign of your brother?
-No, but he's always late, so....

18
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,245
-I thought you only met him once.
-Yeah, I did.

19
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:05,334
I think it sounds, you know, big sister-y,
"Frank's always late." So....

20
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,003
Oh. Well, relax. He'll be here.

21
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,756
-Yeah, no, I know. I'm just nervous.
-Oh.

22
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,134
You know, it's just, you know, Mom's dead,
don't talk to my sister...

23
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,845
...Grandma's been sleeping
a lot lately.

24
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,724
It's just the "last desperate chance
to have a family" kind of thing.

25
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,393
-Mm.
-You're so sweet to wait with me.

26
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,481
Well, actually, Gunther sent me.
You're not allowed to have cups out here.

27
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,111
Does anyone else think
David Copperfield's cute?

28
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,450
No, but he told me he thinks you're a fox.

29
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,912
All right. Janice likes him.

30
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,083
In fact, she likes him so much,
she put him on her, uh, freebie list.

31
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,629
Her what?

32
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:55,801
We have a deal where we each pick five
different celebrities we could sleep with...

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,929
...and the other one can't get mad.

34
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,307
Ah, the heart
of every healthy relationship:

35
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,353
honesty, respect,
and sex with celebrities.

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,146
So, Chandler, who's on your list?

37
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,940
Uh, Kim Basinger...

38
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,401
...Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry...

39
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,444
-...Yasmine Bleeth...
-Oh.

40
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,572
...and Jessica Rabbit.

41
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,537
Ahem. Now, you do realize that she is
a cartoon and way out of your league?

42
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,749
I know. I just always wondered if I could
get her eyes to pop out of her head.

43
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,961
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?

44
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,880
First I need a boyfriend.
Then I can have a list.

45
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,800
It's just a game, Mon.

46
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,137
Rach, how about you?

47
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:44,558
Oh, I don't know. I guess Chris O'Donnell,
John F. Kennedy Jr...

48
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,353
...Daniel Day-Lewis, Sting
and Parker Stevenson.

49
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,857
Spider-Man?

50
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,859
Hardy Boy.

51
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,112
-Peter Parker.
-Thank you.

52
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,865
What about you, honey?
Who'd be on your list?

53
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:04,202
I.... Oh, that kind of thing
requires some serious thought.

54
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,706
First, I'll divide my prospective candidates
into categories.

55
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,416
Ahem. What a geek.

56
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,379
Everybody, this is Frank.
This is my half brother, Frank.

57
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,922
-This is everybody.
-Hey.

58
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,883
-This is Ross.
-Hi, how are you?

59
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,134
-Chandler.
-Hi.

60
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,510
-Hi.
-Joey.

61
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,637
-Hey.
-Hi, hi, hi.

62
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,390
-This is Monica.
-Whoa.

63
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,477
-And this is Rachel.
-Hi.

64
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,187
Whoa.

65
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,857
I'm gonna get coffee for us.

66
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,027
Hey, how do you guys
get anything done? Ha, ha.

67
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,070
We don't, really.

68
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,324
Well, so do you guys have big plans?

69
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,411
Oh, yeah. We're gonna, like, connect and,
you know, bond and everything.

70
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:51,374
I was thinking we could go down to
Times Square and pick up some ninja stars.

71
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,587
Oh, urn, my friend Larry,
he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.

72
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,217
You know, we really don't take advantage
of living in the city.

73
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,858
Oh, sorry. Did I get you?

74
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,402
No, you didn't get me.

75
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,906
It's an electric drill.
You get me, you kill me!

76
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,284
Calm down.
Do you want this unit or not?

77
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,037
I do not want this unit.

78
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,207
Well, you should've told me before.
I'm not a mind reader.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,045
And we're out of beer.
Okay, I'm going to Monica's.

80
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,339
Fine.

81
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,974
Hey. Where you heading in those pants?
1982?

82
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,768
Oh, Monica, listen...

83
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:55,605
...I saw down at the hardware store
they got those designer tiles on sale...

84
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,691
...if you wanna redo your bathroom floor.

85
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,235
What's wrong with my bathroom floor?

86
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,321
Nothing.
It's just old and dingy, that's all.

87
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,492
-I highly doubt that.
-Oh, yeah?

88
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:12,414
If you move your hamper,
you can see the color the tile used to be.

89
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,749
-Ah!
-Yeah.

90
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,712
I can't live like this.
What are we gonna do?

91
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,505
Relax, relax. Here, hold this.

92
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,633
This old stuff comes right up.
I'll show you.

93
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,471
A little more than I wanted to see.

94
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,394
Look at that.
Every inch of this is glued down.

95
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,148
It'd take forever to pry this up.
You should, uh.... You should just leave it.

96
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:44,779
I can't leave it.
You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.

97
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,239
Uh, oh.

98
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,999
-Ah? There you go.
-Aw.

99
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,417
Yeah, that's nice.

100
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,379
You know, we can put it back there after
the surgeons remove it from your colon.

101
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,680
Ooh, ooh!

102
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,848
-What?
-Yeah.

103
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,434
I know what I wanted to ask you.
Can you roll your tongue?

104
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,188
Because I can and my mom couldn't.

105
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:22,067
And I thought, you know- I figured that
was something I got from our dad.

106
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,612
-Well, wait, you mean like this?
-Yeah.

107
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,072
Yeah, you can do it too. Yeah.

108
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,533
You're not doing it.

109
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,329
Oh, right, okay.
Yeah, my mom could and I can't.

110
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,999
So we don't have that.

111
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,091
-When's your birthday?
-February 16th.

112
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,760
I know a guy who's the 18th.

113
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,639
That's close.

114
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,185
-When's yours?
-October 25th.

115
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,942
That's the same month as Halloween.

116
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,069
Yeah.

117
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,282
So, what kind of things
do you like to do at home?

118
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,618
Melt stuff.

119
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,668
-Okay, I've got three of my five.
-Three of your five what?

120
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,130
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.

121
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,507
God, you are giving this a lot of thought.

122
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,301
Hey, it's hard, okay?
I only have two spots left.

123
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,137
All right.
Who you got it narrowed down to?

124
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,931
Okay. Ahem. Elizabeth Hurley.

125
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,100
-Ooh, very attractive.
-Yeah.

126
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,935
Forgiving.

127
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,856
Susan Sarandon.

128
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,651
Eh, you know what? She's too political.

129
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:51,322
She probably wouldn't let you do it
unless you donated four cans of food first.

130
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,118
And Isabella Rossellini.

131
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,078
-Ooh.
-Ooh. Very hot. Very sexy.

132
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:02,000
But, uh, you know, she's too international.
She's never gonna be around.

133
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,878
-So?
-So you gotta play the odds.

134
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,339
Pick somebody who's gonna be
in the country, like, all the time.

135
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,594
Yeah. Because that's why you won't
get Isabella Rossellini. Geography.

136
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,816
Okay, so by "melting,"
you meant melting.

137
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,818
Yeah.

138
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,197
-So is it, like, art?
-Yeah, you can melt art.

139
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,951
-Hey, can I use your phone?
-Mm.

140
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:41,539
-Yeah, sure. You wanna call your mom?
-No, I wanna melt it.

141
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,793
Oh. Well, um, not right now.

142
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,886
You know what? I'm just gonna go to bed.
The fumes are giving me a headache. So....

143
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,098
Yeah. Yeah. Ha, ha.

144
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,976
Good night, bro.

145
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,686
Good night.

146
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,776
Here.

147
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,903
Just in case.

148
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,322
Oh, excellent.

149
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:30,171
-What kind of karate is that?
-No kind.

150
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,716
-He just makes it up.
-Hmm.

151
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,637
-So how's it going with you guys?
-So far it kind of blows.

152
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,186
I don't know, I just thought, you know,
that he'd feel more like a brother.

153
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,814
Like you and Ross.
Just close and connected and....

154
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,483
Oh. We're close now,
but you wouldn't believe the years...

155
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,613
...of noogies and wedgies and
flying wedgies and atomic wedgies and....

156
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,826
That's when the waistband
actually goes over your head.

157
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,911
Ah.

158
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,123
We drove each other crazy
playing the shadow game.

159
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,251
-How do you play the shadow game?
-How do you play the shadow game?

160
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,628
-I just asked you.
-I just asked you.

161
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,922
I don't have time for this.

162
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,759
-No, that is what the game is.
-Well, you just gave up really quickly.

163
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,264
-Have you seen Joey?
-What's the matter?

164
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,933
Oh, just this.

165
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:33,318
It's my fault, really, because the couch
is where we usually keep the varnish.

166
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,530
Hey, somebody wanna hand me
one of those tiles?

167
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,702
-What's going on?
-He's retiling my floor.

168
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,955
Yo, spackle boy.

169
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,626
-Get up.
-Ah-ah. You started this, you will finish it.

170
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,628
He started mine first.

171
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,756
Build the unit, Cinderellie.
Lay the tile, Cinderellie.

172
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,636
Whoa.

173
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,180
Big octopus.

174
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,600
Yeah.

175
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,355
Hello?

176
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,399
Oh, my God. I totally forgot.

177
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,985
Well, can't someone else do it?

178
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,446
But I have company.

179
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,494
Yeah, no, look, that's all right.
I'll come in. Okay.

180
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,664
Um, I'm really sorry,
but I have to go into work.

181
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,459
It's one of my regulars.
He's insisting that I do him, so....

182
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,003
-Hey, what kind of work do you do?
-Oh.

183
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,882
I'm a masseuse.
I give people massages and stuff.

184
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,970
You work at one of
those massage parlors?

185
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,349
Well, you know, we don't call it that.
But, yeah.

186
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,688
Whoa, that's wild.

187
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,856
No, I had no idea. Ha-ha-ha.

188
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,858
Alrighty. Heh.

189
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,613
I'll be back in a little bit.
Unless you wanna come with me.

190
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,699
You mean, like, watch?

191
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,328
No. No, you can get one yourself.
It'll be on the house.

192
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,039
You know, what are big sisters for?
Ha, ha.

193
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,543
Well, I don't think this. You know?

194
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,837
No, no, no. I wouldn't do you myself.

195
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,839
I mean, that would be weird.

196
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,175
Yeah. I'll get one of the other girls
to do it.

197
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:25,179
Ooh, this is so much fun. Yay! Ha, ha.

198
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,432
-Are you excited?
-Yeah.

199
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,228
Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?

200
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,357
It's beautiful.

201
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,236
It's like the first bathroom floor
there ever was.

202
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,738
Whoa.

203
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,240
What are you going in there for?

204
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,409
You want, like, a number?

205
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,540
-Hey.
-Hi. Bye.

206
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,461
Okay. I'm done with my choices.

207
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,921
These are final.

208
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,009
-Well, it's about time.
-Yeah. Very official.

209
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:07,555
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,
Chandler printed it up on his computer.

210
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,098
And who laminated it?

211
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,186
That was me.

212
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,438
All right, let me see. Ahem.

213
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,484
"Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,
Elizabeth Hurley...

214
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,027
...Michelle Pfeiffer...

215
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,905
...Dorothy Hamill"?

216
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,704
Hey, it's my list.

217
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,832
Okay, honey, you do realize
she only spins like that on ice?

218
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,006
Ow, ow, ow.

219
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,967
-Oh. What? Whoa.
-Ow, you know? Ow.

220
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,637
-Hey, hey, what's going on?
-She broke my arm.

221
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,473
-He touched my fanny.
-No, she touched mine first.

222
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,225
That's my job.

223
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,684
So wait, what's the deal?

224
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,062
I can have sex with you
but I can't touch you?

225
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,688
Ew.

226
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,234
-You can't have sex with her.
-Did you think I was a hooker?

227
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,904
No, okay. I know. You're a masseuse.
It's cool. I'm not a cop.

228
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,199
Okay.

229
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,327
Can you ask Mr. Wiffler
if he can wait for, like, five minutes?

230
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,995
Fine.

231
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,289
I don't like you.

232
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,461
So that's what you thought I did? God.

233
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,672
That's not what I do.

234
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,092
Wait, that....
Wait, that's not what you do?

235
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,177
No.

236
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,012
Why would you think that?

237
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,558
I don't know. I mean, you know....
This is the city, you know? I just....

238
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,059
I mean, uh...

239
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,686
...I don't know.

240
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:42,108
Whatever. It's the perfect end
to the perfect weekend anyway.

241
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,735
Oh, wait.

242
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,197
No, you're right. No, it was perfect.

243
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,242
I can't believe
that I screwed it up so bad.

244
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,704
You really thought it was perfect?

245
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,081
Well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect...

246
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,876
...but, you know, it was pretty cool,
you know?

247
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,628
Because we had all those great talks,
you know?

248
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,383
Yeah. Urn....

249
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,261
Which ones in particular
were great for you?

250
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,931
Well, you know,
about the tongue thing, you know?

251
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,768
And how I told you about my likes
and my dislikes.

252
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,228
I don't....

253
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,191
How I like to melt stuff
and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.

254
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,737
Right. Okay. Mm-hm.

255
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,323
You know,
I feel like I can really talk to you...

256
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,075
...because, you know,
you're my sister, you know?

257
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,247
Yeah. I guess I do. Yeah.

258
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,167
And then I go feel your friend up
and make you mad at me.

259
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,839
Yeah, well, I wasn't hopping mad,
you know?

260
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,717
You hopped a little bit.

261
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,931
Yeah, I'm really sorry.
You know, I'm really....

262
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,058
Okay.

263
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,105
Well, this is my favorite part
of the weekend. Right now. This.

264
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,107
-This?
-Uh-huh.

265
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,652
Oh, come on. We went to Times Square.

266
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,072
We found ninja stars.
I almost get my arm broken by a hooker-

267
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,657
She's not a hooker.

268
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,452
Well, when I tell my friends about her,
she will be.

269
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,001
Okay. On three.

270
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,962
One, two-

271
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,797
Why don't we just go on two?

272
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,633
-Why two?
-Because it's faster.

273
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,136
Yeah, I could've counted to three four times
without all this two talk.

274
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,140
-All right, but in the future-
-Okay. Heavy thing not getting lighter.

275
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,809
Okay.

276
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,519
One, two-

277
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,145
-So we are going with two?
-All right.

278
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,574
Oh, good job, Joe.

279
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,410
Wow.

280
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,619
It's big.

281
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:03,374
Yeah. Yeah, so big that it actually
makes our doors look smaller.

282
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,668
Maybe my ruler's wrong.

283
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,379
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

284
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,506
Look, it's not that bad.

285
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,634
So what? It blocks a little of your door,
a little of my door.

286
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,844
I got a better idea.

287
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,681
How about it blocks none of my door
and a lot of your door?

288
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,730
Listen, before I forget,
that side is still wet.

289
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,861
Okay, ahem,
let me just see if I've got this right.

290
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,489
So this is a half-caf, double-tall,
easy-hazelnut...

291
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:40,703
...nonfat, no foam, with whip,
extra-hot latte, right?

292
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,371
Okay, great.

293
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,957
Ahem. You freak.

294
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:54,175
-Thank you. Ahem.
-A coffee to go, please.

295
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,720
<i>Oh, my God. Guys.</i>

296
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,388
Isabella Rossellini.

297
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,141
Are you serious? Oh, my God.

298
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,895
Damn. I cannot believe
I took her off my list.

299
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,272
Why? Because otherwise you'd go for it?

300
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,109
Yeah, maybe.

301
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,071
Oh, heh. You lie.

302
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,281
You don't think I'd go up to her?

303
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:21,243
Ross, it took you 10 years
to finally admit you liked me.

304
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:28,751
Yeah? Well, missy, you better be glad
that list is laminated. Heh.

305
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:33,255
You know what, honey? You go ahead.
We'll call her an alternate.

306
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:38,010
-Okay. Hold my cruller.
-Okay.

307
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,888
Rach, are you really gonna let him
do this?

308
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,432
Honey, he's about to go hit
on Isabella Rossellini.

309
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,310
I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.

310
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,440
Hi. Hi.

311
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,109
I'm Ross.

312
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,946
Um, you don't know me,
but I'm a big, big fan of yours.

313
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,116
I mean, urn, <i>Blue Velvet. </i>Whoo.

314
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:07,123
I was wondering if I could maybe
buy you a, urn, cup of coffee.

315
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,792
Or reimburse you for that one.

316
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,088
Aren't you with that girl over there?

317
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,261
Well, yeah, kind of.

318
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,180
But that's okay.
See, we have an understanding.

319
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,767
See, we each have this list
of five famous people...

320
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,352
...and you were one of mine.

321
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,813
So I'm allowed to sleep with you.

322
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,150
No, no, no. It's flattering.

323
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,485
Whoa. Heh, heh.

324
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,823
-I don't know-
-No, no, no. Wait. Wait, Isabella.

325
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,867
Don't just dismiss this so fast.

326
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,453
I mean,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

327
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,662
Yeah, for you.

328
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,249
Is that the list?

329
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,001
-Um, yes.
-Can I see it?

330
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,294
-Um, no.
-Come on.

331
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,087
But- Okay.

332
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,173
I'm not on the list.

333
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,842
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.

334
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,303
It's laminated.

335
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,305
Yeah.

336
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,349
Um, okay, see, you were on my list.

337
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,435
But then my friend Chandler...

338
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,441
...brought up the very good point
that you are international.

339
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:19,278
So I bumped you for Winona Ryder.
Local.

340
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,907
You know, it's ironic,
because I have a list...

341
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,076
-...of five goofy coffeehouse guys...
-Uh-huh.

342
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:30,372
...and yesterday, I just bumped you
for that guy over there.

343
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,999
That...?

344
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,965
We're just gonna be friends.

345
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,681
-You know what?
-Hmm?

346
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,350
Betcha I could fit in there.

347
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,563
I got 5 bucks says you can't.

348
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,025
Get out your checkbook, mister.

349
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,320
Oh, I think I have the cash.

350
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,661
You are dog, man.

351
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,497
I totally fit.

352
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,833
Yeah. You got me.

353
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,044
I'm out five big ones.

354
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,173
There you go.

355
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,259
Thank you.

356
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,094
Cha-ching.

357
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,015
Oh, well, hello, Mr. Lincoln.

358
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,143
Better luck next time, buddy.

359
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,689
And the drinks are on me.
