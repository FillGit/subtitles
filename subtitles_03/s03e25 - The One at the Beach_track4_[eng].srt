1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:06,048
So, uh, your first sexual experience
was with a woman?

2
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:09,760
All right, I was 15.
It was my best friend, Ruth...

3
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,346
...and we got drunk on that hard cider.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,140
And then suddenly, I don't know,
we were making out.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,976
Tell it again.

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,648
Seriously.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,486
Is that woman capable of talking
about anything else but sex?

8
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,116
Yeah, sure. Well, you know, earlier,
she was talking about geography.

9
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:37,579
Joey, she was listing the countries
she's done it in.

10
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,041
Well, I think we all learned something.

11
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,962
Hey, you guys. Look what I found.
Look at this.

12
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,339
That's my mom's writing. Look.

13
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:51,260
"Me and Frank and Phoebe,
graduation, 1965."

14
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:55,013
-Do you know what that means?
-That you're actually 50?

15
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,517
No, no. That's not "me" Phoebe.
That's her pal, Phoebe.

16
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,978
According to her high school yearbook,
they were BFF.

17
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,815
-Best friends forever.
BOTH Oh.

18
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,275
-That's great.
-That is so cool.

19
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,943
I know. So this woman probably could-

20
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,362
Like, has all kinds of stories
about my parents.

21
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,364
And she might even know
where my dad is.

22
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,700
So I looked her up
and she lives by the beach.

23
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,994
So maybe this weekend
we can go to the beach.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,370
-Yeah, we can.
-Yeah.

25
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,373
-Shoot, I can't go. I have to work.
-That's too bad.

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,709
Aw, big fat bummer.

27
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,713
So great. Okay, tomorrow
we're gonna drive out to Montauk.

28
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,215
Hey, Bonnie had sex there.

29
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,437
Would you look at them?

30
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,940
I'm never gonna find a boyfriend again.

31
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,318
I'm gonna die an old maid.

32
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,779
You're not gonna die an old maid.

33
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,531
Maybe an old spinster cook.

34
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,371
-Thanks.
-Hey, besides, worse comes to worse...

35
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,790
-...I'll be your boyfriend.
-Ha-ha-ha.

36
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,752
Yeah, right.

37
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,924
Why is that so funny?

38
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,468
You made a joke, right?

39
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,220
So I laughed.

40
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,349
A little too hard.

41
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,352
What, am I not, uh, boyfriend material?

42
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,105
No. You're Chandler.

43
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,526
You know. Chandler.

44
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,196
Okay, so we've established my name,
and hit me.

45
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,866
But theoretically, say we weren't friends.
Say it's a blind date.

46
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,035
I show up at your door and I'm,
like, uh:

47
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,413
"Hey, nice to meet you. Hey. Hey."

48
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,876
I'd probably be scared of a guy
using a fake voice.

49
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,088
-Hey.
-Oh, hey. Oh, good. You bought food.

50
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,465
No, just my luggage.

51
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,511
-Hey.
-Hey, guys.

52
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,680
All right. Yeah.

53
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,891
Oh, I am having
the best karma this week.

54
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,394
First, I find this woman
who knew my parents...

55
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,522
...and then my client with the fuzzy back
gives me his beach house.

56
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,483
What about that, uh,
bike messenger you hit?

57
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,069
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.

58
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,238
-Hey.
-Hey.

59
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,407
Hey, check out the hat.

60
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,745
Wait a minute, I know that hat.

61
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,622
I was taken aboard that hat.

62
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,168
They did experiments on me.

63
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,794
I can't have children.

64
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,423
Seriously, where did you get the hat?

65
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,049
Ross gave it to me.

66
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,927
-Aw, I think she looks good.
-Thank you.

67
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,472
Did he buy it for you...

68
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,765
...or win it for you?

69
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,602
Well, excuse me,
my fashion-impaired friends...

70
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,021
...I'm here to tell you that hats are back.

71
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,941
And this time, they've ganged up
and formed one giant super-hat.

72
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,240
Go, go, go.

73
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,576
Now everybody wants to be under the hat.

74
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,749
Oy.

75
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,002
What's with all this sand?

76
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,797
Oh, yeah. Bob said
there might be flood damage.

77
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,216
Either that or he has a really big cat.

78
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,181
Well, yes, it's kind of an unusual house.

79
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,143
It has, um, three beautiful bedrooms
and, uh, no baths.

80
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,064
But, you know, the ocean is right there.

81
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,649
Knock, knock, knock.

82
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,817
Hang on a second. Come in, come in.

83
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,070
All right, so think about it
and call me back.

84
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,115
-Are you Phoebe Abbott?
-Uh, yes.

85
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,661
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott.
I'm your best friend's daughter.

86
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,373
You're Irwin's daughter?

87
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,376
I know. I mean, your old best friend.
Here.

88
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,256
-Lily? From high school? Remember?
-Oh, God. Lily. Yes.

89
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,550
Of course I remember Lily.

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,302
I— Then you must be-

91
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,471
Phoebe, Phoebe.

92
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,099
Phoebe, yeah.
She named me after you, I guess.

93
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,978
Uh-huh. Wow. Well. Look, there's Frank.

94
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,855
Yeah. Yes. Yes, yes.

95
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,232
-That's my dad. That's Frank. Ha, ha.
-Oh!

96
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,443
-I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
-Oh!

97
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,029
Take it easy. If you want,
there's cookies on the counter.

98
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,157
-Or sangria. I could make sangria.
-No, no.

99
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,244
-Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
-Oh.

100
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:14,749
So, um, anyway, urn,
I've been looking for my father and, um....

101
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:19,337
-Have you heard from him or seen him?
-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

102
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,048
I guess I lost track of everybody
after high school.

103
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,592
Oh.

104
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,302
Okay.

105
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,431
Well, so tell me everything
about my parents. Everything.

106
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,809
Oh, well, you know,
we were always together.

107
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,020
The other kids had a nickname
for the three of us.

108
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,148
-Oh, what? What was it?
-The Three Losers.

109
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,859
Oh, poor Lily.

110
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,402
Oh.

111
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,740
You know, I heard about what happened.
That must have been just terrible for you...

112
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,242
...losing your mother that way.

113
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,287
Yeah, no, it was great.

114
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,342
You know what a really good
rainy-day game is?

115
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,053
-What?
-I mean, naked game.

116
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,930
Strip poker. We should play strip poker.

117
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,641
-No.
-Are you crazy?

118
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,478
Come on. When you go away,
you have to play. It's, like, a law.

119
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,689
-All done.
-Aw, thank you.

120
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,233
Okay. Who's next?

121
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,528
No.

122
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,697
No way.

123
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:32,077
Come on, please. I'm bored.
You let me do it once before.

124
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,668
Yeah, well, if, uh-
If that's the rule this weekend....

125
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,005
-Get away.
-Take it like a man, Ross. Come on.

126
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,424
-No, no.
-Oh, come on.

127
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,592
Big bullies.

128
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,972
No, no, no.

129
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,231
-Hey.
-Hey.

130
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,857
Oh. So how are we doing?

131
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,734
Bored and bored.

132
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,738
Hey, you know what naked card game's
never boring?

133
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,532
No.

134
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,493
So, what's Phoebe like?

135
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,122
I'm kind, caring and sweet.
What's Monica like? Ha, ha.

136
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,084
Uh, no, the other Phoebe.
The one you went to see?

137
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,920
Oh, I think she knows
where my dad is.

138
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,088
-What?
-Cool.

139
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,715
Well, where is he?

140
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,342
She was pretending
like she hasn't heard from him in years...

141
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,594
...but I found this picture on her fridge.

142
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,347
Look, isn't this what he would
look like now?

143
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,599
-Totally familiar.
-Yeah.

144
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,685
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

145
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,854
Why would she lie to you?

146
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,897
I don't know,
but we're having dinner tomorrow.

147
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,524
I figured she's gonna tell me then.

148
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,901
You know, maybe she just wanted
to give him time...

149
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,529
...to buy me presents. I don't know.
Ha, ha.

150
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,033
-So you're all bored?
-Yes.

151
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,494
All right, I'm gonna close my eyes
and point to someone.

152
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,415
And whoever I point to has to come up with
something fun to do. And we have to do it.

153
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,959
-Okay. All right. Fan out. Fan out.
-Okay.

154
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,378
Okay.

155
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,381
Ooh, you know, we could just do this.

156
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,677
Okay, urn....

157
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,846
We all have to play strip poker?

158
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,598
Oh, yes!

159
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,768
Strip <i>Happy Days </i>game?

160
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,354
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards,
so it was either this...

161
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,107
...or Strip Bag-of-Old-Knitting-Stuff.

162
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,276
Done.

163
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,819
Okay.

164
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,948
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.
Collect two cool points."

165
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,076
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

166
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,913
Get five cool points, you get to make
someone take off one item of clothing.

167
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,749
It hasn't happened yet,
but we're all very excited.

168
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,126
Okay, come on.

169
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,338
Daddy needs a new pair
of electromagnetic microscopes...

170
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,799
...for the Prehistoric Forensics
department.

171
00:09:56,137 --> 00:10:00,600
Okay. "Take Pinky Tuscadero
up to Inspiration Point.

172
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,061
Collect three cool points." Yeah.

173
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,938
Which gives me five.

174
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,482
And let's see,
who is gonna lose their clothes?

175
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,529
Um, I think I pick our strip poker
sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

176
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,493
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.

177
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,542
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.
Collect three cool points."

178
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:30,922
Which means I have five,
and that means I get Joey's boxers.

179
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,680
Fine. Gang up on me.

180
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,724
I got you all right where I want you.

181
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,893
Come on. Take them off.

182
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,603
Actually, you know, it's kind of cold.

183
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,440
So how about I keep my boxers on
and give you all a peek at the good stuff?

184
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,151
All right,
I'm gonna make more margaritas.

185
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,238
Whoa, hey, what are you doing?
Trying to get me drunk?

186
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,740
I'm just making margaritas.

187
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,994
Think I'll help her out.

188
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,958
-What is going on here?
-What?

189
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,460
-You're painting his toenails.
-Oh, come on.

190
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,213
-Chasing him around the room.
-Monica, please.

191
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,257
He's totally flirting with you too.

192
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,093
He is, isn't he?

193
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,931
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe it's just
being here at the beach together...

194
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,349
...or but it's like something-

195
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,895
Hey.

196
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,858
-Hi, Bonnie.
-Hi.

197
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,193
My boss let me off early,
so I took the train.

198
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,237
-Oh.
-What are you guys doing?

199
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,032
We're playing Strip <i>Happy Days </i>game.

200
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,076
Cool. I'll catch up.

201
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,338
So you still don't think...

202
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,590
...I'm boyfriend material?

203
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,342
Huh?

204
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,845
Saw you checking me out
during the game last night.

205
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,140
-You didn't even take off your pants.
-Yeah, well, lucky for you.

206
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,727
-What?
-I don't know.

207
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,399
Well, is everybody else having
just the best time?

208
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,859
Shh. Shh.

209
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,069
Joey's asleep.

210
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:29,290
After he passed out, we put sand
around him to keep him warm.

211
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,880
Well, I assume the, uh, happy couple
isn't up yet?

212
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,966
Did you guys hear them last night?

213
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,259
Oh, yeah. I don't know
what they were doing...

214
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,971
...but sea turtles actually came up
to the house.

215
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,308
-Good morning.
-Hey.

216
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,060
-How'd everybody sleep?
-Great.

217
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,478
Like a log.

218
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,063
Us too.

219
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,525
I'm going for a walk.

220
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,324
Good morning. Nice breasts, by the way.

221
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,628
Hey, what happened to you?

222
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,465
Oh, uh, nothing. I just felt like
hanging out here and reading.

223
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,426
Oh, the water was so great.

224
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,303
We jumped off this pier
and my suit came off.

225
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,307
Oh. Sorry I missed that.

226
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,642
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

227
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,519
Oh, ha, ha.

228
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,564
I think I brought back half the beach
in my hair.

229
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,525
It was so much easier
when I used to shave my head.

230
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,865
You know, I gotta tell you...

231
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,909
...I just loved your look
when you were bald.

232
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,454
-Really?
-Oh.

233
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,290
Because I think about shaving it
all off again sometimes.

234
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,459
-Really?
-Yeah.

235
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,836
I mean, you definitely should do that.

236
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,131
-You know what? I should do it.
-Yeah.

237
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,467
You know what? Thank you, Rachel.
You are so cool.

238
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,428
Oh, stop. Go on.

239
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,347
-Now, go shave that head.
-All right.

240
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,110
What's the matter, Pheebs?

241
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,738
She canceled.
My namesake canceled on me.

242
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,574
-What?
-She claims she had to go out of town.

243
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:27,992
She's avoiding me.

244
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,119
She doesn't want to tell me
where my father is.

245
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,537
She knows and she won't tell.

246
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,873
Aw, Pheebs, that sucks.

247
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,753
Yeah, well, don't
"Aw, Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.

248
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,963
-Where are you going?
-Well, she's out of town.

249
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,509
So there's gotta be something in her house
that tells me where my father is.

250
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,929
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that
"breaking and entering."

251
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,224
-Well, are any of those people here?
-Oh, no.

252
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,560
Okay. Look, I'll do something nice,
okay?

253
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,022
I'll fill her ice trays. Good?

254
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,942
Hey, everybody.

255
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,485
Wow. Wow!

256
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,032
Ha, look what you did.

257
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,329
-You wanna touch it?
-No, but it's great.

258
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,081
Come on, touch it.

259
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,166
Okay.

260
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,463
You can feel all the bones
in your skull.

261
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,930
-Hi.
-Hi.

262
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,475
I was having a little chat with Bonnie,
and, uh, guess what.

263
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,269
She happened to bring up, you know...

264
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,980
...who was behind the whole, um,
head-shaving idea.

265
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,024
And now, who was it? Oh, that's right.
That's right, it was you.

266
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,945
That was her idea.

267
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,865
I just gave her a nudge.

268
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,367
She said you gave her the razor.

269
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,870
-Yo.
-Hey.

270
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,289
So anyone up for a midnight dip
in the ocean?

271
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,624
-Uh, no, I'm good.
-No, thanks.

272
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,794
-Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
-Okay, have fun. Bye.

273
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,841
Come on, see?
She doesn't look that bad.

274
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,428
You can see the moonlight
bouncing off her head.

275
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,432
-What the hell were you thinking?
-I don't know.

276
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,767
You don't know?
Rach, you balded my girlfriend.

277
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,228
All right. Ross.

278
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,441
Do you think it's easy for me
to see you with somebody else?

279
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,651
You know what?
You're the one who ended it.

280
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,864
Yeah, because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.

281
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,076
-You still love me?
-No.

282
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,663
You still love me.

283
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,333
Yeah, so? You love me.

284
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,293
No- Mm.

285
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,048
What does this mean? What do you-?

286
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,051
I mean, do you want
to get back together?

287
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,720
No. Maybe.

288
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,514
I don't know.

289
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,309
Ross....

290
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,898
I still can't forgive you for what you did.

291
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,443
I just- But sometimes when I'm with you,
I just feel so....

292
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,736
What?

293
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,989
I just- I feel....

294
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,576
-I just—
-What?

295
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,703
I feel-

296
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,421
No. I don't care.

297
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,801
I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker
with you for practice.

298
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,053
But I made cards.

299
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,889
Well.

300
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,474
Good night.

301
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,102
I'm going upstairs.

302
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,229
-Good night.
-Night.

303
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,321
Wanna play strip poker for practice?

304
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,171
Ow.

305
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,549
My ass.

306
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,306
Okay.

307
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,683
Okay, good.

308
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,728
Ooh. Shh.

309
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,238
Shh, shh.

310
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,496
Shh.

311
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,048
-Aah!
-No! Oh, it's me. It's me.

312
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,301
-I didn't wanna make any noise.
-Then don't break in.

313
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,639
-I'm sorry.
-What are you doing here?

314
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,851
I came to fill your ice-cube tray.

315
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,562
What?

316
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,357
Um, okay.

317
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,360
Okay, look. Huh. Ahem.

318
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:16,655
I took this picture from your fridge, okay?
Because I know that this is my father.

319
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,242
Yeah, this is Frank Buffay, and you
were standing right there next to him.

320
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,204
Now, look, I deserve to know
where I came from.

321
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,582
All right? So if you can help me
find my father, then you should.

322
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,001
Otherwise, you're just mean.

323
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,631
So just tell me the truth.

324
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,424
All right.

325
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,054
The man in that picture
is Chuck Mangione.

326
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,975
My father is Chuck Mangione?

327
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,894
No, no. That's just Chuck Mangione.

328
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,438
I sold him a house last year.

329
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,818
And I'm very sorry, but I really don't
know where your father is.

330
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,736
And that's the truth.

331
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,571
Oh.

332
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,408
But, um, you're right.

333
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,953
I think that a person should know
where they come from.

334
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,123
Which is why I, uh....

335
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,376
Uh....

336
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,630
Okay....

337
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,341
I'm your mother.

338
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,679
Huh?

339
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,850
You know, I wanted to tell you yesterday,
but I just....

340
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,643
I felt all floopy, and....

341
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,065
I'm telling you.
You guys are getting back together.

342
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,609
That's not true.
She doesn't even know what she wants.

343
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,820
Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.

344
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:41,365
Okay, well, then you gotta back away.
You don't need that kind of hurt.

345
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,367
Take it from a guy who's...

346
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,954
...never had a long-term relationship.

347
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:52,209
I know, but I really want to go
up there and finish that kiss.

348
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,669
-Hey.
-Aah.

349
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,964
You guys, the water is great.
You should really go in.

350
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,341
Oh, uh, no, thanks. I just had an M&M.

351
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,802
Okay. Well, good night.

352
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,429
Good night.

353
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,433
-Don't be too long.
-O key-do key.

354
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,103
There is not one hair on that head.

355
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,191
Hey, it'll grow back, right?
And she's really fun, and she's cool.

356
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,027
And I'm finally moving on.

357
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,781
I mean, getting over Rachel
was so, ugh, you know?

358
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,909
You know, I'm finally feeling sane again.
And now if I go up there...

359
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,203
...and I kiss her and....

360
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,580
God, I want to kiss her.

361
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,540
And it doesn't work out, right?

362
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,959
Do I really wanna put myself
through that again?

363
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,669
So let me get this straight.

364
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,296
If you go with Bonnie tonight...

365
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,299
...you're doing the smart,
healthy thing and moving on.

366
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,467
-Yeah.
-Right?

367
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,303
And if you go with Rachel,
Bonnie's free tonight?

368
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,902
Hi.

369
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,079
Hi there.

370
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,707
That's that weird voice again.

371
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,501
Let me try it again.

372
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,796
You're gonna wanna date this next guy,
I swear. Okay, come on.

373
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,261
Hi, I'm Dorf.

374
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,265
Your date for the evening.

375
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,354
Oh, come on. Dorf on dating?
That's good stuff.
