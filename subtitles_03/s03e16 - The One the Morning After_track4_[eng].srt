00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,797
-<i>Previously on </i>Friends:
-I don't feel like I have a girlfriend.

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:09,051
You want me to quit my job so you
can feel like you have a girlfriend?

3
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,178
-Is this about Mark?
-Oh, my God.

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,680
-Okay, it's not.
-Oh, my God.

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,058
I cannot keep having
this fight with you!

6
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,518
Look, ugh,
maybe we should just take a break.

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,854
Fine. You're right.
Let's, uh, take a break.

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,941
-Let's get some frozen yogurt.
-No.

9
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,902
A break from us.

10
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,741
Then we had this big fight,
and I said I wanted to take a break.

11
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,701
I don't want to take a break.

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,036
This is crazy.

13
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,913
<i>Can't we work on this?</i>

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,164
What do you want to drink?

15
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,166
Who's that?

16
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,585
Nobody.

17
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,296
-Is that Mark?
-Honey, look, he just-

18
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,340
Yeah. Got it!

19
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,218
Hey, come dance.
What are you, married?

20
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,263
-Ha, ha.
-Because that's okay.

21
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,404
-Hey.
-Hey.

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,823
How was the big anniversary dinner?

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,034
Well, we never actually got to dinner.

24
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,953
Ha, ha, oh. Nice.

25
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,832
We kind of broke up instead.

26
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,667
What? Aah!

27
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,672
My God! It's on the ceiling!

28
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:29,923
That's okay.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,259
This is more important than fruit...

30
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,011
...on my ceiling.

31
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,847
You broke up?

32
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,225
Yeah, but it's okay because
when Ross left, Mark came over.

33
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,812
-Oh, no! You and Mark?
-No, it's okay. Calm down.

34
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,439
Mark and I talked...

35
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,860
...and I realized how much
I love your stupid brother.

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,572
We got our problems,
but I really wanna make it work.

37
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,049
Morning!

38
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,023
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

39
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,609
<i>I've been trying to reach you all night.
I feel awful.</i>

40
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,862
<i>Please, Ross, you've got to know,
there's nothing between me and Mark.</i>

41
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,532
<i>This whole breakup thing
is just stupid.</i>

42
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,870
<i>Ugh, I'm sorry I put you through it.</i>

43
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,623
<i>And I don't want to get
back together over a machine.</i>

44
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,958
Mm-mm.

45
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,668
<i>So I love you.</i>

46
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:30,877
I love you.

47
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,297
<i>And you know what?
I'm gonna go to bed now...</i>

48
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:39,344
<i>...but on my way to work tomorrow,
I'll stop by around 8:30. Bye.</i>

49
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,932
Chloe, how's it coming?

50
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,560
What kind of puppy do you think
I should get?

51
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,645
Um, oh, hey. I don't know.
How about a big one?

52
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,523
-But my apartment's so-
-Then a small one.

53
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,192
-We have to go.
-Wait! Where's my shoes?

54
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,444
You need shoes?

55
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,742
-Do I know why we're rushing?
-You know my girlfriend?

56
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,996
It turns out that she, uh,
wants to get back together.

57
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,205
I found it!

58
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,458
That's so great for you guys!

59
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,126
You must be so happy!

60
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,254
Yes, I am.
One of the many things I'm feeling.

61
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,968
-Good luck with your girlfriend.
-Oh, thank you. Ah, eh.

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,348
Rachel!

63
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,521
-You got my message?
-You are right on time!

64
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,191
So can I be your girlfriend again?

65
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,942
Yes, you can. Very much.

66
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,361
Ah, ah.

67
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,326
-Hey.
-Hey.

68
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:48,038
-Why are you mopping your ceiling?
-Ugh, there's banana on it.

69
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,667
I have the spirit of an
old Indian woman living in mine.

70
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,961
So then you know.

71
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,550
The mailman was here,
so I brought your mail.

72
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,887
-Oh, good. Thanks.
-Now, what is Fabutech?

73
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,182
Okay. Don't judge me too much, okay?

74
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,810
I saw this infomercial,
and, um, I swear I have never...

75
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,230
...bought anything on TV before.

76
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,232
Except for this mop.

77
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,360
But there was this stuff on leg-waxing,
it looked amazing.

78
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,238
-Waxine!
-Yes! Have you seen it?

79
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,032
It's incredible!
I want to be a Waxine Girl!

80
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,450
I know!

81
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,288
God! Do you think it really doesn't hurt?
How can they do that?

82
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,875
Hello! Organic substances recently
discovered in the rain forest?

83
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,795
They have the best stuff in there.

84
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,548
Oh, my God!

85
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,300
Oh, my God!

86
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:47,305
We figured when we couldn't find you,
you'd gone to make up with Rachel.

87
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,683
Which is probably what
you should have done, huh? Heh.

88
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,769
You think?

89
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,232
God, I'm in hell.
I mean, what am I gonna do?

90
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,570
Rachel's all "I love you,"
and all I can think about...

91
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,573
...is what is she gonna do
when I tell her what I did?

92
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,577
First, we should address
the more important question...

93
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,161
...how dumb are you?

94
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,251
What? Look, we're trying to rebuild
a relationship here, right?

95
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,045
How am I supposed to do that
without being honest?

96
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,549
I'm on board about
the total-honesty thing. I am.

97
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,303
Just not about stuff that's
gonna get you in trouble.

98
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,931
He's right. Nobody benefits,
and you'll just hurt her.

99
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,893
And there won't be a relationship
left to rebuild.

100
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,102
Don't you think--?

101
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,814
If you have to tell her,
at least wait till the timing's right.

102
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,025
And that's what deathbeds are for.

103
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,988
-Yeah, okay.
-All right.

104
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:50,327
Okay. Now, we just have to make sure
she doesn't find out some other way.

105
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,830
Did you think about the trail?

106
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,417
What trail?

107
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,962
From the woman you did it with...

108
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,424
...to the woman you hope
never finds out you did it!

109
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,093
Always think about the trail!

110
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,348
I don't think there's any trail.

111
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,974
Okay, okay.

112
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,477
Chloe works with that guy, Isaac.

113
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:19,898
Isaac's sister is Jasmine, who works
at the massage place with Phoebe.

114
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,068
Phoebe is Rachel's friend,
and that's the trail! I did it!

115
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,907
"After applying the Waxine
and linen strips to leg-"

116
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,533
-Did that!
-Okay.

117
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,870
"Grasp the linen strip by its tab...

118
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,413
...and pull it off in one quick...

119
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,707
-...pain-free motion."
-Okay.

120
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,376
Ow!

121
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,046
Was it not "pain-free"?

122
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,216
No, it was pain-ful!

123
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,011
My God, they should call it
"Pain-zine, now with a little wax."

124
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,517
The girls on the commercial
don't seem to think it's that bad.

125
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,853
Because their nerves are
deadened from being so stupid.

126
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,859
But, you know, if you don't
believe me, please be my guest.

127
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,989
Ow, ow, ow! Oh, my God!

128
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,617
Now are you glad we didn't start
with the bikini strips?

129
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,582
Chloe, hi.

130
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,711
Is this about me taking your watch?

131
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,881
-You took my watch?
-I'm sorry. I do that.

132
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,261
You keep it. Listen,
did you tell anyone about us?

133
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,597
Oh, no. I feel like it really
isn't anybody's business.

134
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,976
Exactly. So you didn't
mention anything to Isaac?

135
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,896
-Oh, I tell Isaac everything.
-You do? Of course you do.

136
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,318
Hi, Isaac.
You know, we haven't actually met.

137
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,112
You dog!

138
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:56,411
Yes, I suppose I am a dog.
But see, I happen to have a girlfriend.

139
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,830
Right. Rachel from the coffee place.

140
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,875
That's the one.
Listen, I don't want to hurt her.

141
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,836
Oh, hey, man, I know.
It doesn't matter how much we love them.

142
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,547
Monogamy is too cruel a rule.

143
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:13,887
Yeah. Listen, can you keep
this information to yourself?

144
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,639
Oh, no problem.
We gotta look out for each other.

145
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,558
We're the same, you and me.

146
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,272
Actually, no, we're not. Heh.

147
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,857
Yeah, we are.

148
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,234
No, we're not.

149
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,736
Yeah, we are.

150
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,113
No, we're not.

151
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,783
-Okay, we're not.
-Right.

152
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,326
But we are.

153
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,082
Fine. I just need to know
that you're not gonna tell your sister.

154
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,168
I can promise not to tell her again.

155
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,423
-Jasmine?
-Uh-huh.

156
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,426
We met at Phoebe's birthday party.
I'm Ross Geller.

157
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,929
You did a bad thing!

158
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,848
-Yes, I did.
-Very bad!

159
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,892
-Very bad.
-Very, very bad!

160
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,269
I'm agreeing with you.

161
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,939
Listen, did you happen
to tell Phoebe yet?

162
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,608
-No.
-Okay. Jasmine.

163
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,277
Please. Please don't.

164
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,865
I love my girlfriend very much
and I want to work it out with her.

165
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,910
All right.

166
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,204
Thank you. Thank you.

167
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,291
But you should talk to my roommate.
I told him, and he knows Phoebe too.

168
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,001
Who's your roommate?

169
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,045
Gunther! Gunther!

170
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:34,926
Tell me you didn't tell Rachel about
me and the girl from the copy place.

171
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,886
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,888
Was I not supposed to?

173
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,070
-Ow! Ow!
-Ow! Ow!

174
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,865
Ow, ow, ow!

175
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,203
-We're all right.
-It's okay. It's okay.

176
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,374
-Ooh! We were just waxing our legs.
-Off?

177
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:12,130
For your information, this is a pain
like no man will ever experience.

178
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,091
You can't make that statement
unless you've been kicked in an area...

179
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,011
...that God only meant
to be treated nicely.

180
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:23,057
Women just have a lower threshold
for pain than men, that's all.

181
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,852
I mean, come on,
it's just a little wax. Heh.

182
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,729
Oh, yeah? Come here.

183
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,274
Oh, that's mature.

184
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,944
-So now I just pull it off?
-Uh-huh.

185
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,196
That's right.

186
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,788
Rachel, come on. Just talk to me. Please!

187
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,416
-I can't look at you right now.
-What?

188
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,169
Nothing. Nothing.

189
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,881
-She said it was okay.
-What are they talking about?

190
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,719
-Just get away from me!
-I made a mistake, okay?

191
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,932
A mistake? What were you trying
to put it in? Her purse?

192
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,436
Whe~? Where did he put it?

193
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,816
You had sex with another woman!

194
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,027
-Oh, my God!
-Oh-

195
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:20,698
I knew something was wrong because
my nails didn't grow at all yesterday.

196
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,036
I guess they had a fight,
and he got drunk-

197
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,122
You guys knew about this
and didn't tell us?

198
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,792
He has sex,
and we get hit in our heads!

199
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,878
-I want you to leave! Get out! Now!
-No! No!

200
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,005
I want to stay and talk about this.

201
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,133
Okay! All right. How was she?

202
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,551
Uh-oh.

203
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,266
-What?
-Was she good?

204
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,517
Don't answer that.

205
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,315
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Let's talk. How was she?

206
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,193
-She was....
-Awful.

207
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,488
-She was not good.
-Horrible. Nothing compared to you.

208
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,408
She- She was different.

209
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,993
-Ooh.
-Uh-oh.

210
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,121
Good different?

211
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,457
Nobody likes change.

212
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,128
-Just stop!
-What? Okay! Okay! Okay!

213
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,213
Should we do something?

214
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,549
Yeah. Never cheat on Rachel.

215
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,596
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
I was disgusted with myself...

216
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,265
...and this morning I was upset...

217
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,101
...and then I got your message,
and I was so happy.

218
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,396
And all I wanted was to get her out
of my apartment-

219
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,566
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Wait a minute.

220
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,737
What time did your little friend leave?

221
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,572
Uh-

222
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,577
Oh, my God. She was there?
She was still there?

223
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,872
She was in there when I was in there?

224
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,546
Listen, the important thing is,
she meant nothing to me.

225
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:02,342
And yet she was worth
jeopardizing our relationship!

226
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,220
I didn't think there was
a relationship.

227
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,806
-We'd broken up.
-We were on a break.

228
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,560
That, for all I knew,
could last forever. That is a breakup.

229
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,562
You're gonna get out of this
on a technicality?

230
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,023
I'm not trying to "get out"
of anything.

231
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,067
I thought our relationship was dead.

232
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,196
Well, you sure had a hell of a time
at the wake.

233
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,116
I don't think we should listen
to this anymore.

234
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,327
What are you doing?
We can't go out.

235
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,788
Why not? I'm hungry.

236
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,291
Because they'll know
we've been listening.

237
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,294
God! And to have to hear about it
from Gunther!

238
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:43,132
Come on, I ran all over the place trying
to make sure that didn't happen!

239
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,345
Oh, that is so sweet.

240
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,849
I think I'm falling in love with you
all over again.

241
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,647
We can go out.
They have other things to worry about.

242
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,023
We'll be fine.

243
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,693
Rachel, I wanted to tell you.
I thought I should.

244
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,572
And then Chandler and Joey
convinced me not to!

245
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,912
Wax the door shut.
We're never leaving.

246
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:18,292
It's Phoebe. Someone has to take
my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak...

247
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,546
...because it's 9:15 now,
and I'm not there.

248
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,884
None of this would've happened
if I didn't think...

249
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,428
...you were having sex with Mark.

250
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,721
All right.

251
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,935
Let's say I had slept with Mark.
Would you have been able to forgive me?

252
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,189
Yes, I would.

253
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:47,071
You'd be okay if Mark had kissed me
and been naked with me...

254
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,698
...and made love to me?

255
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,284
Yes.

256
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:56,247
If you knew that our hot, sweaty,
writhing bodies were-

257
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,624
La, la, la, la, la, la!

258
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:04,589
Okay. Okay, yeah.
I would have been devastated...

259
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,425
...but I would still want
to be with you.

260
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,428
Because, I mean, it's you.

261
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,472
Aw.

262
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,272
What?

263
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,817
Come on, tell me what you're thinking.

264
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,322
I'm thinking...

265
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,993
...I'm gonna order a pizza.

266
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,915
Order a pizza, like...

267
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,709
..."I forgive you"?

268
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,424
Oh, man!

269
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,218
Pizza?

270
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,762
I like pizza.

271
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,265
Put olives on the pizza.

272
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,606
We could eat the wax! It's organic!

273
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,026
Oh, great. Food with hair on it.

274
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,655
No, not the used wax.

275
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,157
Because that would be crazy?

276
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,997
Could I get in on that?
Because I'm kind of hungry myself.

277
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,332
Fine.

278
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,293
Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.

279
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,672
-No anchovies.
-With, uh, extra anchovies.

280
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,091
That's okay. I'll pick them off.

281
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,636
And could you chop some up
and put it right in the sauce?

282
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,478
You can have the last piece
if you want.

283
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,481
Well, I should think so.
You slept with someone.

284
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,705
They're gonna get through this,
aren't they?

285
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,874
Yeah. Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.

286
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,084
They've got to.

287
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,421
What if they don't?

288
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,136
You think I need a new walk?

289
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,390
What?

290
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:23,436
Well, I've been walking
the same way since high school.

291
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,690
You know how some guys walk into
a room and everybody takes notice?

292
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,900
I think I need a take-notice walk.

293
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,945
Are you actually saying these words?

294
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,369
What, now you're not even
talking to me?

295
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:47,501
Look, Rachel, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I was out of my mind.

296
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,253
I thought I'd lost you.

297
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,548
How insane must I have been
to do something like this?

298
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,802
I don't cheat, right?
That's not me. I'm not Joey!

299
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,013
Whoa!

300
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,433
Yeah, okay.

301
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,021
Hey.

302
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,775
It's 3 a.m. They don't
know that I've come home yet.

303
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,903
You notice how they aren't
wondering where I am?

304
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:18,074
You know,
people can be so self-involved.

305
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:23,496
You know what? I'm not the one
that wanted that break.

306
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,290
You're the one that bailed.
You're the one...

307
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,709
...that ran the moment things
got rough.

308
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,086
-That's-
-That's what?

309
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,922
-That is neither here nor there.
-Here we are...

310
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,257
...in a spot again. What do you want?

311
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:39,178
How do you want to handle it?
You want to fight for us or bail?

312
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,266
Look, I-

313
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,146
I did a terrible, stupid,
stupid thing, okay?

314
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,192
I'm sorry. I wish I could
take it back, but I can't.

315
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:57,655
I just can't see us throwing away
something we know is so damn good.

316
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,825
I love you so much.

317
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,379
No, Ross! Don't!

318
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,966
You can't just kiss me
and make it all go away.

319
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,510
It doesn't work that way.
It doesn't just make it better.

320
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,387
-Okay?
-Okay, okay.

321
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,060
I think you should go.

322
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,105
What?

323
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,816
I really think you need to go now.

324
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,528
Okay. Okay.

325
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,324
This morning you said there was
nothing we couldn't work past it.

326
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,201
What the hell did I know?

327
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,413
There's got to be a way
we can work past this. Okay?

328
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,583
I can't imagine my life without you.

329
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,293
You know? Without-

330
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,963
Without these arms...

331
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,717
...and your face and heart...

332
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,011
...your good heart, Rach, and....

333
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,933
No.

334
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,854
I can't. You're a totally
different person to me now.

335
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:17,693
I used to think of you as somebody
that would never, ever hurt me.

336
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,028
Ever.

337
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,907
Now I can't stop picturing you with her.

338
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,869
I can't. It doesn't matter what you
say or what you do.

339
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,663
It's just changed everything.

340
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,751
Forever.

341
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,222
This can't be it.

342
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,771
Then how come it is?

343
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,076
They've been quiet for a long time.

344
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,662
Maybe she killed him.

345
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,209
Let's go.

346
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,905
Is that your new walk?

347
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,370
No. I really have to pee.
