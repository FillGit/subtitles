1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:05,923
Janice has a question.
Who of the six of you...

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,927
...has slept with
who of the six of you?

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,430
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,935
I'm sorry, the answer there
would be none of us.

5
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,772
Over the years, none of you
ever got drunk and stupid?

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,608
Well, that's really
a different question.

7
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:30,072
I can't believe a group of people
who spends this much time together...

8
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,324
...has never bumped uglies.

9
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,954
There was that one time
Monica and Rachel got together.

10
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,872
What?

11
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,708
Excuse me, there was no time.

12
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,419
Okay, but let's say there was.

13
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,380
How might that go?

14
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,049
Okay, okay.

15
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,801
Well, then answer me this:

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,055
Have any of you ever almost...?

17
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,728
-Anybody need more coffee?
-Hey, there's a dog out there!

18
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,449
-Ugh. That is so unfortunate.
-What?

19
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,327
Cute Naked Guy's
starting to put on weight.

20
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,913
I'll be back in just a minute.

21
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:06,501
I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks
on the phone.

22
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,462
You didn't leave lipstick marks
on the phone.

23
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,215
Oh! Then it must have been you. Bye.

24
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,843
Bye-bye.

25
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,722
-That's why I moved out.
-Hey, while we're on that...

26
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,517
...when are you gonna tell my sister
you don't live here anymore?

27
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,978
On some level, she already knows.

28
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,731
She doesn't know you sneak out
every night...

29
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,649
...and back every morning...

30
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,111
...and that you've been
at your grandmother's for a week.

31
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,739
Okay, well, maybe not on those levels.

32
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,991
-Hey.
-Hey.

33
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,830
I'm never gonna find a roommate.
Ever.

34
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,082
Nobody good?

35
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,751
There was the guy with the ferrets.

36
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:48,919
That's plural.

37
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,882
The spitter. Oh! And the guy
who enjoyed my name so much...

38
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,760
...he made a noise
every time he said it.

39
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,679
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing.
Bing!"

40
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,266
"Great apartment, Chandler Bing.
Bing!"

41
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,435
-How many more tomorrow?
-Two.

42
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,938
This photographer
who seemed really dull...

43
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,982
...and this actor guy
who I'm not sure about.

44
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,694
When I answered
the phone, "Chandler Bing"...

45
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,321
...he said, "Whoa! Short message!"

46
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,074
Ross....

47
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,785
Foot on the floor
or come over no more.

48
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,872
Your dresser is missing,
but this she notices.

49
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,710
-What?
-I have to go. Heh.

50
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,505
Carol should be home by now, so....

51
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,383
-How's it going with you guys?
-Better, actually.

52
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,720
I finally figured out why we're
having so much trouble.

53
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,472
-Oh, really?
-Yeah. You know how I have you guys?

54
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,809
She doesn't have any close
friends that are just hers.

55
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:50,147
But last week, she met this woman
at the gym, Susan something.

56
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:55,068
And they really hit it off, and
I think it's gonna make a difference.

57
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,322
So, uh, Eric...

58
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,658
...what kind of photography do you do?

59
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,368
Oh, mostly fashion.

60
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,455
There may be models here sometimes.
I hope that's cool.

61
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,208
Yes, that is cool.

62
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,336
Uh, because I have models here,
you know...

63
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,506
...never.

64
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,761
Ooh! During the summer, I spend most
weekends at my sister's beach house...

65
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,847
...which you're welcome to use.

66
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,267
Although I should tell you,
she's a porn star.

67
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,898
Well, I still have
one more person to meet.

68
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,026
But unless it turns out
to be your sister...

69
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,904
...ahem, I think your chances
are pretty good.

70
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,864
All right.

71
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,078
Bedroom, bathroom, living room.

72
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,124
This here is the kitchen,
and thanks for coming by. Bye-bye.

73
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,377
Don't you, uh, wanna ask me
any questions?

74
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,924
Sure. Uh.... Hmm....

75
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,176
What's up?

76
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,596
Well, I'm an actor.

77
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,389
I'm fairly neat.

78
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,226
I got my own TV.

79
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:13,146
Oh, and don't worry, I'm totally
okay with the gay thing.

80
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,150
Ha, ha. What gay thing?

81
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:23,198
Uh, just, you know, in general.
The whole people-being-gay thing.

82
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,034
Totally cool with that.

83
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,332
Okay, Jerry.
Thanks for stopping by.

84
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,088
-Hi.
-Hey.

85
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,591
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

86
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,434
Hey, Mon.

87
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,689
-Wanna hear something that sucks?
-Do I ever!

88
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,693
-Chris says they're closing the bar.
-No way!

89
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,153
They're turning it into
a coffee place.

90
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,822
Just coffee?

91
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,158
-Where are we gonna hang out?
-You got me.

92
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,953
-Can I get a beer?
-Did you pick a roommate?

93
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,122
-You bet.
-Is it the Italian guy?

94
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,498
Hmm, yeah, right.

95
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,167
He's so cute.

96
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,170
That's what I want.
A roommate I can walk around with...

97
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,756
...and be referred to
as "the funny one."

98
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,676
Table's free. Rack them up.
Back in a minute.

99
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,178
Get ready for me to whip your butt.

100
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,307
Okay, but after that
we're shooting some pool.

101
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:35,604
Oh, ahem, no, no, no.
Excuse me? Hello? Hi.

102
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,107
My friend ordered an onion...

103
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,151
...not an olive.

104
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,279
And I ordered a rum and Diet Coke...

105
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,698
...which I don't think this is.

106
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,159
-I am so sorry.
-That's all right.

107
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,038
How hard is it to get a couple
drinks right, huh?

108
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,666
Well....

109
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,502
I would like to propose a toast...

110
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,298
...to the woman who, in one year
from today, will become...

111
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,676
...Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.

112
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,347
I think it's time
to see the ring again.

113
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:19,356
Ugh! Isn't it exciting? I mean,
it's like having a boyfriend for life! Heh!

114
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,444
Ahem. Yeah, I know.

115
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,404
What?

116
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,657
Oh, I don't know.

117
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,410
Well, maybe it's just the idea...

118
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,205
...of Barry for the rest of my life.

119
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,831
I don't know, I think I....

120
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,042
I feel like having
one last fling...

121
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,253
...just to sort of get it
out of my system.

122
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,092
-Rachel, stop!
-You're so bad! Ha!

123
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,137
I'm serious. I really think
I need to just have...

124
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,556
...some meaningless sex,
you know?

125
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,476
With the next guy I see.

126
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,236
Excuse me, I seem to have
dropped my ball.

127
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,322
Yeah, so?

128
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,369
And now I've picked it up again.

129
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,458
My God!
I went to high school with her.

130
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,085
Rachel!

131
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,670
Hi.

132
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,630
Monica!

133
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,341
Look! Hi! What do you think?

134
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,843
Oh, my God!

135
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,721
You can't even see
where the <i>Titanic </i>hit it.

136
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,850
Yes, his name is Barry.
He's a doctor, thank you very much.

137
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,644
Aw, just like you always wanted.
Congratulations.

138
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,690
Thank you. So how about you?
Are you seeing anybody?

139
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,316
Not right now.

140
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,277
Oh, well, that's okay.

141
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,529
I know.

142
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,494
So I think I'll get back
to my friend.

143
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,122
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

144
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,962
Can we have lunch
the next time I'm in the city?

145
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,338
That'd be great.

146
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,340
-Okay. Bye.
-Thanks. Bye.

147
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,512
Ten bucks says I never see
that woman again in my life.

148
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,682
No, honey, really. It's fine.

149
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,518
Just go with Susan.

150
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,853
Really, I think--

151
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,148
I think girls' night out
is a great idea.

152
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,860
Okay. Okay. Bye.

153
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,781
-What are they doing?
-I don't know. Something girly.

154
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,911
Hey, you're early.

155
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,080
What are you doing with the lamp?

156
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,499
Just taking it to get rewired.

157
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:49,047
Don't take it where you took the
stereo. They've had that over a week.

158
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,016
No, no. Mr. Heckles, no one is making
any noise up here.

159
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,936
You're disturbing my oboe practice.

160
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,439
-You don't play the oboe.
-I could play the oboe.

161
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,318
Then I'm gonna have to ask you
to keep it down.

162
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,616
Who are you?

163
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,620
-I'm Eric, Chandler's new roommate.
-I'm Chandler's new roommate.

164
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,500
-I don't think so.
-I could be Chandler's new roommate.

165
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,128
-But he told me over the phone-
-He told me in person.

166
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,422
That's weird.

167
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,884
I'm going to, uh, go into
my new apartment now.

168
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,223
Huh?

169
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,239
Hi again.

170
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:57,991
Hey.

171
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,913
Hey.

172
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,623
Thank you so much.

173
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,252
Don't thank me.
Thank the jerk that never showed up.

174
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,671
Okay, I gotta get to work.

175
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,258
-You want some help?
-No, thanks. I got it.

176
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,760
-No, I don't!
-Whoa! Ha, ha.

177
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,222
-You okay?
-Yeah. Phew!

178
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,933
I stood up too fast.
Got a little head rush.

179
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,269
It's the heat.

180
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,274
And the humidity.

181
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,028
That's...

182
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,529
...a tough combination.

183
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,786
Do you want to come in
for some lemonade?

184
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,788
Like you wouldn't believe.

185
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,881
Wow. This is a great place.

186
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,300
Thank you.

187
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,428
Just make yourself comfortable.

188
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,597
Gotcha.

189
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,353
So this place is really
my grandmother's.

190
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:16,486
I got it when she moved to Florida.
Otherwise I could never afford it.

191
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,533
So if the landlord ever asks...

192
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,496
...I'm an 87-year-old woman who's
afraid of her VCR. You thirsty?

193
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,831
You bet I am!

194
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,167
Okay...

195
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,961
...here's your penis!

196
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,844
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?

197
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,847
You said, "You wanna come in
for some lemonade?"

198
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,349
So?

199
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,270
-Ah! Were you just gonna give me lemonade?
-Yuh-huh!

200
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,022
Cover yourself up!

201
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,732
Oh, right. Sorry.

202
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,526
God, I don't believe this!

203
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,530
Someone asks you in for lemonade
and that means they want to have sex?

204
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,658
Usually, yeah.
Well, not just lemonade...

205
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,035
...iced tea, sometimes juice.

206
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,039
Look, sorry. I just-

207
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,041
I thought you liked me.

208
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,085
I'm such a jerk.

209
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,380
It's okay.

210
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,050
I suppose it could happen to anyone.

211
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,011
Not anyone I know, but....

212
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,349
By the way, I can still see it.

213
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,237
-Pheebs?
-Huh?

214
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,572
Where's your bed?

215
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,994
It's not in the apartment?

216
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,789
Oh, no!

217
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,127
I can't believe this
is happening again.

218
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,757
-What?
-Okay, enough with the third degree!

219
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,053
I don't live here anymore.

220
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,765
-What are you talking about?
-I'm sorry.

221
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,809
I don't live here anymore.

222
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,899
I didn't know how to tell you.
But, you know, everybody else knows.

223
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,403
Everybody knows?

224
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,948
That was supposed to be a good thing.
I forget why.

225
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,954
Monica, do you know I couldn't sleep
for a month...

226
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,625
...because I got a dot of ink
on one of the sofa cushions?

227
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,461
You could've just turned
the cushion over.

228
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,672
I would have, but I had
a spaghetti stain on the other side.

229
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,965
What?

230
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,134
This is what I'm talking about.

231
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,763
I need to live in a land
where people can spill!

232
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,641
Well, you can spill.

233
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,643
In the sink.

234
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,689
Oh, honey. It's not your fault,
you know. This is who you are.

235
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,859
And I love you.
And I want us to be friends.

236
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,821
And if I stay here,
I don't see that happening.

237
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,325
-I love you too.
-Good.

238
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,704
What?

239
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,999
What? I'm just sad.

240
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,461
No, you're not.
You're wondering which cushion it is.

241
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,345
So what are you watching?

242
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,638
<i>Baywatch.</i>

243
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,225
What's it about?

244
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,353
Lifeguards.

245
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,690
Well, it sounds kind of stup-

246
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,316
Who's she?

247
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,027
Nicole Eggert.

248
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,155
We like her.

249
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,871
Wow! Look at them run!

250
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,624
They do that a lot.

251
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,212
Hey, you want a beer?

252
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,424
-I'll get one.
-Don't get up. I got a cooler here.

253
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,638
-Hello?
-Hey.

254
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,266
Do you have any beers?
We're out of beers.

255
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,393
Help yourself.

256
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,353
You okay?

257
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,399
Phoebe moved out.

258
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,903
Right.

259
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,739
I don't understand.

260
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:34,452
Am I so hard to live with?
Is this why I don't have a boyfriend?

261
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,745
No....

262
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,748
You don't have a boyfriend because....

263
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,669
I don't know why
you don't have a boyfriend.

264
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,255
You should have a boyfriend.

265
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,799
I think so.

266
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,178
Come here.

267
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,429
Come here.

268
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,268
Listen, you are one
of my favorite people...

269
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:03,689
...and the most beautiful woman
I've ever known in real life.

270
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,621
Hi.

271
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,792
Where is everybody?

272
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,129
Ugh, it's already closed. Chris gave me
the keys to lock up. What is wrong?

273
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,258
I think my marriage...

274
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,801
...is kind of over.

275
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,136
Oh, no! Why?

276
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,472
Because Carol's a lesbian.

277
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,603
And I'm not one.

278
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,485
And apparently it's not
a mix-and-match situation.

279
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,779
Oh, my God!

280
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,657
I don't believe it!

281
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,660
Oh, you poor bunny.

282
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,663
I'm an idiot.

283
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,332
I mean, I should have seen it.

284
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:08,546
I mean, Carol and I would be out,
and she'd see some beautiful woman...

285
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,008
...and she'd be, "Ross! Look at her!"

286
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,676
And I'd think:

287
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,637
"God, my wife is cool." Heh.

288
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:26,856
Aw. Hey, do you think that Susan person
is her lover?

289
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,652
Well, now I do!

290
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,572
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,868
Seven years!

292
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,705
I mean, we've been together
seven years.

293
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,042
She's the only woman
who's ever loved me.

294
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,878
She's the only woman I've ever....

295
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,048
Oh, Ross.

296
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,678
Mm. This is nice.

297
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,555
I know. It is, isn't it?

298
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,393
No, I mean it.
This feels really good.

299
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,023
Is it 100 percent cotton?

300
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,569
Yeah...

301
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,571
...and I got it on sale too.

302
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,823
I should go.

303
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:22,244
One of the lifeguards was just about
to dismantle a nuclear device.

304
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,456
If you want to get
a drink later, we can.

305
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,124
That sounds great.

306
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,835
Oh, and listen, it's gonna be-

307
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,253
I know.

308
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,255
Thanks.

309
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:41,722
Maybe this wouldn't have happened
if I'd been more nurturing...

310
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,643
...or I'd paid more attention...

311
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,853
...or I had a uterus.

312
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,565
-I can't believe it.
-I know.

313
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,111
You know, you don't deserve this.
You don't, Ross.

314
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,113
-You're so good.
-Thanks.

315
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,073
And you're so sweet.

316
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,784
-Thanks.
-And you're kind.

317
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,244
Thanks.

318
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,589
Come here.

319
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,968
Wait, wait, wait.

320
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,141
It's okay.

321
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,817
Wait, wait, wait!
My foot is stuck in the pocket.

322
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,154
-What?
-I can't get it out.

323
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,157
That's not something
a girl wants to hear.

324
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,159
Come on, don't start.

325
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,786
-Ow!
-What?

326
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,497
Stupid balls are in the way.

327
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,184
Oh, well.

328
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,647
That probably wouldn't have been
the most constructive solution.

329
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,442
You have chalk on your face.

330
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,989
Ugh. You're right. I don't know why
I always thought this was real grass.

331
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,581
Honey, you okay?

332
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,959
My wife's a lesbian.

333
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,212
Cool!

334
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,009
Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.

335
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,312
I can't believe you came back.

336
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,190
Don't say anything.

337
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,902
I don't wanna speak.
I don't wanna think.

338
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:04,907
I just want you to take me and kiss me
and make love to me right here...

339
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,408
...right now.

340
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:12,623
<i>It's the time of the season</i>

341
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,750
<i>When love runs high</i>

342
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,001
<i>Rachel!</i>

343
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,753
Rachel!

344
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,881
-What?
-You missed the exit.

345
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,592
Oh! Sorry.

346
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,762
My God, what were you thinking about?

347
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,931
Ahem, urn....

348
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,432
Barry.

349
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,726
Aw.
