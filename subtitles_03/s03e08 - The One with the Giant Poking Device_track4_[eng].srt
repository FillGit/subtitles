1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,503
Here you go, Pheebs.

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:06,340
Who wants one of my
special home-baked brownies?

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:07,591
I'll have one.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,968
Agh! Ugh.

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,179
-That's okay.
-I'm not having one.

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,890
No, no. It's just my tooth.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,975
-All right.
-I'll have one.

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,687
So you need a dentist?
I've got a good one.

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:25,108
Thanks. I have a good one too.
I just can't see him.

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,195
See, that is the problem
with invisible dentists.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,281
Why can't you go to him?

12
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:36,370
Because every time I go
to the dentist, somebody dies.

13
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,499
That's so weird.
Every time I go to the dentist...

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,876
...I look down the hygienist's blouse.

15
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,296
Phoebe, what, urn...?

16
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,547
What?

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,299
First, it was my Aunt Mary.

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,094
And then there was, um,
John, my mailman.

19
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,888
And then my cowboy friend, Albino Bob.

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,308
Ahem. And all these people actually died?

21
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,686
Yes. While I was in the chair.

22
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:04,022
That's why I take care of my teeth.
It's not about oral hygiene.

23
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,316
I floss to save lives.

24
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,152
Come on, you didn't kill anybody.

25
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:13,073
These people just happened to die
when you went to the dentist.

26
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:14,741
It's just a coincidence.

27
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,744
Tell that to them.
Oh, you can't! They're dead!

28
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,921
Thanks, Gunther.

29
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,381
-Hi.
-Hey.

30
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,008
Um, can I get a napkin too?

31
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,844
Oh, like you don't already
have everything.

32
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,680
Ow!

33
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,015
Ow!

34
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,853
You're in pain. Would you just
go to the dentist? Just go.

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,147
Fine. But if you're my next victim...

36
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,651
...don't come back as a poltergeist
who sucks me into the TV set.

37
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,486
I promise.

38
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,571
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,701
Hey, is Chandler here?

40
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,454
No. No, he's not.

41
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:48,585
You guys, Joey just saw
Janice kissing her ex-husband.

42
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,003
-Huh? Oh!
-What?

43
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,215
What are you gonna do?
How are you gonna tell Chandler?

44
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,635
I was thinking about that.
I think the best way would be...

45
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:57,844
...to not.

46
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:02,015
Joey, if you know about this,
you have to tell him.

47
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,476
It'll kill him. It'll just kill him.

48
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,521
Wait till I go to the dentist.
Maybe I'll kill him.

49
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,026
Ew!

50
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:18,115
Ugly Naked Guy's using a hammock.
It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.

51
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,201
I'm going to the dentist. So listen...

52
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:25,622
...just be on the lookout for anything
that you could fall into...

53
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,458
...or that can fall on you...

54
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,001
...or....

55
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,545
All right, just look out!

56
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,549
Okay? And, um, I also just want to....

57
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,969
I just want to tell you all that, urn....

58
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,436
I have a problem. I have to go
into work for a few hours.

59
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,980
Some kids messed up
the Homo sapien display.

60
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,565
What did they do?

61
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,860
They painted over the word
"sapien," for one thing.

62
00:03:55,735 --> 00:04:00,615
Then they rearranged the figures.
Let's just leave it at that.

63
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,576
Do you want me to watch Ben for you?

64
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,536
Yes, that's what I was gonna ask.
Thank you.

65
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,539
Woah, wait, hello! Heh, what about me?

66
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:11,126
You. You want to watch Ben?

67
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,966
That would be great!
I just asked Monica...

68
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,427
...because I know how empty her life is.

69
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,517
-Hey, Ross? I got a science question.
-Yeah. Mm-hm.

70
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:33,482
If the Homo sapiens were, in fact,
"homo" sapiens...

71
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,401
...is that why they're extinct?

72
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,450
Joey, Homo sapiens are people.

73
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,951
Hey, I'm not judging.

74
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,165
Look, Benny! Spoon!

75
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,459
Spoon!

76
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,797
Come on. All right, you know what?
I think he's bored.

77
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,508
Here. You wanna play
the airplane game?

78
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,635
You wanna show Rachel? Come here.

79
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,887
You wanna do something fun? Okay.

80
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,222
Whee!

81
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,227
Whee! Ha, ha, oh!

82
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,360
You're so brave.
You're so brave! Yes, you are.

83
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,445
-You're so brave.
-You're okay.

84
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,864
He's fine. Let's just put him down.

85
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,951
Come here, babe.
Yes, you're such a good boy.

86
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:30,372
How could you do that to him?
Ross trusted me! What's he gonna say?

87
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,582
Nothing, because we're not telling him.

88
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,917
-We're not?
-No.

89
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,086
-All right, I like that.
-Okay.

90
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,172
So we're okay. We're okay, aren't we?

91
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,049
No, we're not okay. There's a bump.

92
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,926
-There's a bump.
-What bump?

93
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,637
Oh, my God! Well, push it in! Push it in!

94
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,598
I can not push it in!

95
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,560
-Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
-Okay.

96
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,978
-That's it.
-Okay.

97
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,312
-I got it!
-Okay.

98
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,189
-The second Ross walks in...
-Yeah.

99
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,651
...take him to your bedroom and do
whatever you do that makes him go:

100
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,781
Or...

101
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,118
...we could put a hat on his head.

102
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:13,123
A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where
are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

103
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,958
Oh, oh, oh! I'll get Rainy Day Bear!

104
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,460
Because he'll know what to do?

105
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,379
Oh, my God. You're a genius!

106
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,464
Oh, God. It's kind of sewn on.

107
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,091
-Give it. Give it.
-Okay.

108
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,676
-Oh!
-Oh.

109
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,807
Agh, it's just like a bloodbath
in here today!

110
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,440
Hey, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

111
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,402
Do you think these pearls are nice?

112
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,446
I'd prefer a mountain bike.

113
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,992
Janice's birthday's coming.
I wanna get her something special.

114
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,204
-Come in here with me.
-Woah, woah, whoa, wait. Woah.

115
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,667
You wanna get her something special?
Get her flowers.

116
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,587
Get her candy. Get her gum.
Girls love gum.

117
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,758
That's a good idea. "Dear Janice:
Have a Hubba-Bubba birthday."

118
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,345
I'd like to get her something serious.

119
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,097
Oh, you want something serious.

120
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,601
You know what you should do?
You should get her one of those, um...

121
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,227
...barium enemas.

122
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,273
Those are dead serious.

123
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,111
Look, I'm gonna go in here.
And you don't buy me anything, ever!

124
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,948
You can't! You can't.
You can't buy her pearls.

125
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,533
You just can't, you can't, you can't!

126
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,452
Why not?

127
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,289
Oh, God. Uh, okay.

128
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,958
Here's the thing. Ahem.

129
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,670
This is the thing. Okay, the thing is—

130
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,962
-What is the thing?
-Okay.

131
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,926
I went down to the
Mattress King's showroom...

132
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,012
...and I saw Janice kissing
her ex-husband.

133
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,307
What?

134
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,101
They were in his office.

135
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,315
Well, she- She wouldn't do that.
She's with me.

136
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,150
I'm telling you, I saw it.

137
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,236
Well, you're wrong. Okay? You're wrong.

138
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,071
I'm not wrong.

139
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,448
I wish I was.

140
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,952
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,375
Bet that barium enema
doesn't sound so bad now, huh?

142
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:28,049
It makes more sense as an ensemble.
And it takes the focus off the hat.

143
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,970
Oh! You're alive! You're alive!

144
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,807
See? I promised you
no one would die, didn't I?

145
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,519
We'll see about that. Can I use your
phone to call everyone I know?

146
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,480
Sure. We have no money. Go ahead.

147
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,985
Hey, you're not dead! Okay, see you.

148
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,739
Monica.

149
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,575
Oh, my God! He just said my name!

150
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,577
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah.

151
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,163
Monica bang!

152
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,793
Ahem. Okay, I heard that.

153
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,296
-Did he just say, "Monica bang"?
-Mm-hm.

154
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,132
Oh, my God! He's gonna rat me out!

155
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,427
-Monica bang!
-Oh, ho, ho.

156
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,347
Sweetie, you need to stop
saying that now.

157
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,100
It's no big deal.
It's not even worth mentioning.

158
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,352
You see? We all do it all the time.

159
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,645
See? Watch this.

160
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,773
Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow.

161
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,650
Monica bang!
Everybody bang!

162
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,152
Ben bang!

163
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,945
Rachel bang!

164
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,114
Bang, Rachel! Bang!

165
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,159
-Oh, isn't it fun?
-Look at that! Look at that!

166
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,203
We all do it!

167
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,663
-Okay, I'm stopping now.
-Are you okay?

168
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,918
Oh, yeah. You know, if it's not
a headboard, it's just not worth it.

169
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,098
How's my Bing-a-ling?

170
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,267
Uh....

171
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,019
I don't know.

172
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,230
You tell me.

173
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,359
Anything you, uh, want to tell me?

174
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,277
Because if you, uh- You should-

175
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,571
You would tell me.

176
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,034
Why are your eyes so wide?

177
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,495
You tell me.

178
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,498
Maybe it's because I was just
fooling around with my ex.

179
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,126
Oh, no. No, no, no. That was you!

180
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,669
Oh, my God!

181
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,671
-All right!
-How did you know?

182
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,006
Joey told me. He saw you two kissing.

183
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,716
In the park?

184
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,679
No. In his office.
How many kisses were there?

185
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,598
-Just those two!
-Wh~? Why? Why?

186
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,560
Why was there kissing?
There should be no kissing!

187
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,479
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I'm so, so....

188
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,440
I'm so, so sorry. I just....

189
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,571
What happened was I....
I can't breathe.

190
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,491
Can you get me a bag or something?
Aah.

191
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159
-Here. Here.
-Aah.

192
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,411
There.

193
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,167
-It's the receipt.
-I'll take it.

194
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,461
Look, I've got to know.

195
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,757
Are you finished with me?

196
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,387
Are you finished with him?

197
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,768
Do you still love him?

198
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,148
Do you still love me?

199
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,484
All right, look...

200
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,238
...I'm gonna need an actual
answer here, okay?

201
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,324
So which is it?

202
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,035
Him or me?

203
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,254
I don't know.

204
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,927
Okay, if you're alive,
you answer your phone!

205
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:07,769
Ben, I won't tell your daddy
that you had ice cream before dinner...

206
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,773
...if you won't tell him about
our little bonking incident.

207
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,401
Number one, I don't think Ben
understands the concept of bribery.

208
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,278
And number two, I-

209
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,490
What?

210
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,117
You said "number two."

211
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,413
I also said "number one."

212
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,165
Ha-ha-ha, I know.

213
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,336
-Hey, everyone!
-Hi!

214
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,505
How's my little boy?

215
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,674
He's perfect. Aren't you, Ben?

216
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,551
-He's never been better.
-What did you do, take him whaling?

217
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,056
Monica.

218
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:49,602
Oh, my God! He just said your name!
That's great! Good job, Ben!

219
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,021
Monica bang!

220
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,690
Ha-ha-ha. That's right.

221
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,776
That's what I'd sound like
if I exploded.

222
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,406
Woo-hoo! The curse is broken!
I called everybody I know...

223
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,449
...and everyone is alive!

224
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,620
-Huh.
-What?

225
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,041
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.

226
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,424
Oh, my God, I killed another one!

227
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,678
The curse is getting stronger too,
to bring down something that big.

228
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,097
Maybe he's just taking a nap.

229
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,808
I'm telling you,
he hasn't moved since this morning.

230
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,476
We should call somebody.

231
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,896
Tell them the naked guy we stare at
isn't moving?

232
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,399
We've got to find out if he's alive.

233
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,027
How are we gonna do that?
There's no way.

234
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,987
Well, there is one way.

235
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,073
His window's open. I say...

236
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,742
...we poke him.

237
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,997
Hey!

238
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,750
You know how we, uh,
save all those chopsticks...

239
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,377
...for no reason
when we get Chinese food?

240
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,670
Yeah?

241
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,256
Well, now we got a reason.

242
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,216
What?

243
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,303
Well, we're fashioning a very long
poking device.

244
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,765
All right.

245
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,895
Hey, uh, what's the matter?

246
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,024
I talked to Janice.

247
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,277
Oh, my God. Is she going back to him?

248
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,112
She doesn't know.

249
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,781
Says she loves us both.

250
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,452
I woke up this morning, I was in love.

251
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,412
I was happy!

252
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,583
It serves me right for buying
that 12-pack of condoms.

253
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,798
And now I can't even return them,
because she choked on the receipt!

254
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,178
What are you, uh-?
What are you gonna do?

255
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,808
I don't know.

256
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,435
You know? What would you do?

257
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,856
Uh, it doesn't matter what I'd do.

258
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,691
Come on. Come on. Tell me.

259
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,113
All right, you, uh...

260
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,742
...you probably won't want
to hear this, but, uh...

261
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,498
...if it was me,
and this is just me, I would, uh....

262
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,834
-I would bow out.
-What?

263
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,046
What are you talking about?

264
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,968
They have a kid together...

265
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,554
...you know? They're like-

266
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,014
They're, like, a family.

267
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,517
And if, I don't know...

268
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,020
...if there's a chance
they can make that work...

269
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,023
...I wouldn't want to be the guy
who stood in the way.

270
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,363
You okay?

271
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,408
You, uh...?

272
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,702
You wanna come poke a nude guy?

273
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,083
-Well, he's finally asleep.
-Mm.

274
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,420
About that, uh, bump on his head....

275
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,756
Are you, uh, sure it's a new bump?

276
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:10,178
No offense, but I've always thought
of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.

277
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,848
It's okay if he bumps his head.
Kids bump their heads all the time.

278
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,143
It was your first time babysitting.
You did your best.

279
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,729
-I did!
-I know.

280
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,231
You just have to watch them
all the time.

281
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,234
I did! I watched! I watched!

282
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,905
I watched Monica bang his head
against that thing!

283
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,449
Monica did it?

284
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,412
-Monica? Urn....
-Yeah.

285
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:40,583
Did you notice anything weird
about Ben today?

286
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,710
No, why?

287
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,964
I was just playing with him, and we
were doing the "Alphabet Song"...

288
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,176
...which he's good at.
But he left out "E" and "F."

289
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:54,764
It's like they just, uh, I don't know,
fell out of his head.

290
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,433
Really?

291
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,811
Oh, and also, he's walking...

292
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,605
...kind of funny.

293
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:08,778
It's like his left leg is moving
a lot faster than his right leg.

294
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,114
Yeah, he's in there,
just sort of, you know....

295
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,787
Oh, my God! I wrecked your baby!

296
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,125
I hope it's still funny
when you're in hell.

297
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,336
You jerk!

298
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:30,633
-You know I love that kid!
-Monica bang! Monica bang!

299
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,927
Ow.

300
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,680
I'll get the hat.

301
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,727
I have something to tell you.

302
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,063
And I want you to let me
get through it...

303
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,148
...because...

304
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,026
...it's not gonna be easy.

305
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,070
Okay.

306
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,533
I think you should go back with Gary.

307
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,413
I don't want to be the guy
that breaks up a family.

308
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,709
You know, when my parents split up,
it was because of that guy.

309
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,128
Whenever I'd see him,
I'd always think:

310
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,881
"You're the reason.
You are why they're not together."

311
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,051
And I hated that guy.

312
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:20,141
And it didn't matter how nice he was
or how happy he made my dad.

313
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,689
Wow!

314
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,317
Yeah, wow.

315
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,362
-It's the right thing to do.
-Ugh.

316
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,448
You're right.

317
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:41,662
Oh, God.
But before I can say goodbye...

318
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,458
...there's something I really
need you to know.

319
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,586
The way I feel about you...

320
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,964
...it's like I finally understand...

321
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,550
...what Lionel Richie's
been singing about.

322
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,054
You know? I mean, what we have...

323
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,140
...it's like movie love.

324
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,310
You're my soul mate.

325
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:09,648
I can't believe we're not gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

326
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,152
Then don't leave me.

327
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,488
What?

328
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,616
Forget what I said! I was babbling!
Pick me!

329
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:22,495
No, you were right!
I gotta give my marriage another chance.

330
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,664
Pssh! No, you don't!

331
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,668
No, I say you have to give your divorce
another chance!

332
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,595
Oh, don't go.

334
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,931
No, I gotta go.

335
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,310
No. No. No, no.

336
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,521
Honey. Honey. Ha, ha.

337
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,065
-People are looking.
-I don't care.

338
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,609
I don't care!

339
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,987
Yeah, um, okay. I'm-

340
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,697
I'm leaving now.

341
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,744
You can't leave! I have your shoe!

342
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,834
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

343
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,097
Rachel has those in burgundy.

344
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:31,564
Remember, something this big and long
will be very difficult to maneuver.

345
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,816
Fortunately,
I have experience in that area.

346
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:39,989
Can we please focus here?
A naked man's life hangs in the balance.

347
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,615
I'm telling you, he's dead.

348
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,327
What we're about to have here
is a dead fat guy on a stick!

349
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,123
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's poke.

350
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,499
Steady.

351
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,251
Steady.

352
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,336
Okay, a little higher.

353
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,213
Careful of the angle.

354
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,133
Okay, okay.
We're approaching the window.

355
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,514
Thread the needle. Thread the needle.

356
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,898
He's alive! He's alive!

357
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,402
And yet we're still poking him.

358
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,238
Okay, retract the device!
Retract the device!

359
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,617
-He does not look happy.
-Hey, hey.

360
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,786
Now he's showing us his poking device.

361
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:33,334
Hey, that's never gonna make it
all the way over here, buddy! Ha.

362
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:43,844
<i>I'll hold you close in my arms</i>

363
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,099
<i>I can't resist your charms</i>

364
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,393
<i>And love</i>

365
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,896
<i>Love</i>

366
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,818
<i>I'll be a fool for you</i>

367
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,822
<i>I'm sure</i>

368
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,617
<i>You know I don't mind</i>

369
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,495
<i>Oh, you know I don't mind</i>

370
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,830
<i>Yes</i>

371
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,544
<i>You mean the world to me</i>

372
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,922
<i>-Oh, I know
-I know</i>

373
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,842
<i>-I've found
-I've found</i>

374
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,261
<i>In you</i>

375
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:29,265
<i>My endless love</i>

376
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:35,729
<i>My endless love</i>

377
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,400
<i>Love</i>

378
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,695
<i>-Lo- Love
-Love</i>
