1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,771
See, Joe, that's why your parents
told you not to jump on the bed.

2
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,866
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam.

3
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:19,288
-I've been at it since 4:00 this morning.
-Where'd you get fruit at 4 in the morning?

4
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,914
Went down at the clocks.

5
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,041
Bet you didn't know
you can get it wholesale.

6
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,918
I didn't know there were docks.

7
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,130
Hey.

8
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,090
-Aw, is it broken?
-Aw.

9
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,801
No, but I gotta wear this thing
for a couple weeks.

10
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,096
Did you tell the doctor you did it
jumping up and down on your bed?

11
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,392
No. I had a whole story
worked out, but then...

12
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,852
...Chandler sold me out.

13
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,103
I'm sorry, Joe.

14
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,024
I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy
that it just fell out of his socket.

15
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,861
What is this? Fruit?

16
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,365
Monica's making jam.

17
00:01:56,033 --> 00:02:00,412
Jam? I love jam. Hey, how come
we never have jam at our place?

18
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,748
Because the kids need new shoes.

19
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,961
I'm going into business, people.
I'm sick of being depressed about Richard.

20
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,881
I needed a plan.
A plan to get over my man.

21
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:14,092
What's the opposite of man? Jam.

22
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,096
Joey, don't. It's way too hot.

23
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,397
This will just be my batch.

24
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,126
Um, that's it. No.
Hey you. J. Crew guy....

25
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,128
Yeah. Why are you following me?

26
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,631
All week long, everywhere I look,
there's you.

27
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,884
You wouldn't return my calls.
You sent back my letters.

28
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,887
-What?
-One more chance, Ursula. Please.

29
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,391
Oh. Oh.

30
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,642
Oh. Well, this is awkward.

31
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,477
-Why?
-Urn....

32
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:09,439
Yeah, because you want Ursula,
and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters.

33
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,275
Seriously.

34
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,154
Oh. That's great.
I'm stalking the wrong woman.

35
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,032
I am such a dingus!

36
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,201
Oh, you're not a dingus.

37
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,996
I just- I want you to know
I didn't used to be like this.

38
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,416
Before I met your sister,
I was, like, this normal guy...

39
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,626
...who sold beepers
and cellular phones.

40
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,297
Well.... I mean, look, it's not your fault,
you know?

41
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,259
I mean, this is just
what she does to guys, okay?

42
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,719
Just....

43
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,471
Well, thanks.

44
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,974
Wait. You know what?
I got a little story.

45
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,143
When I was in junior high school...

46
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,770
...I went through this period
where I thought I was a witch.

47
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,648
And there was this guidance counselor
who said something to me...

48
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,483
...that I think will help you a lot.

49
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,237
He said, "Okay, you're not a witch.
You're just an average student."

50
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,366
-See what I'm saying?
-Not really.

51
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,035
Um, well, get over it.

52
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,167
I mean, you just-
You seem like a really nice guy.

53
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,837
You know, I just—
Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?

54
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,216
Wait, you're right. I know you're right.
And thanks for being so nice.

55
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,552
-Here.
-Aah!

56
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,596
Thanks a lot.

57
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,848
Do you wanna get a cup of coffee or-?

58
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,017
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay.

59
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,354
You don't have to
walk behind me anymore.

60
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,564
Sorry.

61
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,901
-Mon?
-Mon?

62
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,448
"Gone for more jars.
Back later. Monica Geller."

63
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,951
Wait a minute. Look.

64
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,745
-Look, look, look.
-What, what, what?

65
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,206
-It's an empty apartment.
-Mm.

66
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,708
We're all alone
in an empty apartment.

67
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,921
Aw, honey, come on. I have to be
at work in, like, 10 minutes and, oh....

68
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:01,092
All right. Well, it's not like
I'm employee of the year or anything.

69
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,345
Ha, ha. Whoo!

70
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,641
-There it is.
-Oh.

71
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,768
-Oh, that's what you're talking about.
-Ahem.

72
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,728
-Hey.
-Hey.

73
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,647
Do I look fat?

74
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,774
No.

75
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,943
Okay, I accept that.

76
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,903
When Janice asked me and I said no...

77
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,989
...she took that to mean
that I was calling her a cow.

78
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,077
Okay, walk us through it, honey.
Walk us through it.

79
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,745
Okay, well, Janice said, uh:

80
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,915
"Hi. Do I look fat today?"
And I looked at her-

81
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

82
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,544
You looked at her?

83
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,631
-You never look.
-Mm-mm.

84
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,970
You just answer. It's like a reflex.
"Do I look fat?" "No."

85
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,433
"Is she prettier than I am?" "No."

86
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,769
-"Does size matter?"
-No.

87
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,604
And it works both ways.

88
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,861
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?

89
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,406
You know, after about 30 or 40 fights,
you kind of catch on.

90
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,617
Okay. For instance, ahem:

91
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:12,122
Let's say Janice is coming back from a trip
and she gives you two options.

92
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,458
Option number one:
She'll take a cab home from the airport.

93
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,379
Or option two: You can meet her
at baggage claim. What do you do?

94
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,672
That's easy. Baggage claim.

95
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,757
Ehh! Wrong. Now you're single.

96
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,597
It's actually secret option number three.

97
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,058
You meet her at the gate.
That way she knows you love her.

98
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,477
-Hmm.
-Okay, this is good. This is good.

99
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,565
All right, listen, I have one.
Janice likes to cuddle...

100
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,026
-...at night, which I'm all for.
-Mm.

101
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,988
But, uh, you know, when you want
to go to sleep, you want some space.

102
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,991
So, uh, you know,
how do I tell her that without...

103
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,244
...you know, accidentally
calling her fat or something?

104
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:56,041
Oh. Honey, I'm sorry. We can't help you
there, because we're cuddly sleepers.

105
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,169
-Okay, I'm late for work.
-Oh.

106
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,839
-Are you guys gonna come down?
-Uh, yeah. I'm right behind you.

107
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,216
-Good luck, Chandler.
-Thank you, Rachel.

108
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,052
-Bye, sweetie.
-Bye, honey.

109
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,056
Okay, the sleeping thing.

110
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,559
Very tricky business
but there is something you can do.

111
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,896
-I thought you were cuddly sleepers.
-No.

112
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,525
No, not cuddly. Not me. Just her.

113
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,944
I'm like you. I need the room. Ahem.

114
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,530
Okay, come here. Ahem.

115
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,118
Okay. You're in bed.

116
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,620
Yeah?

117
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,626
-I'm gonna use the cushion.
-Yeah.

118
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:45,340
Okay. You're in bed.
She's over on your side cuddling.

119
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,551
Now, you wait for her to drift off...

120
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,221
...and then you hug her...

121
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:56,142
...and roll her over
to her side of the bed.

122
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,436
And then you...

123
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,190
...roll away.

124
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,360
Hug for her.

125
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,907
Roll for you.

126
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,743
-Okay, the old "hug and roll."
-Yep.

127
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,995
-Okay. One question.
-Shoot.

128
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,540
You're pretending
the pillow's a girl, right?

129
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,961
Remember when you were a kid...

130
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,338
...and your mom would
drop you off at the movies...

131
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,425
...with a jar of jam and a little spoon?

132
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,346
You're so pretty.

133
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,395
-Hi.
-Hey, Phoebe.

134
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:44,315
Hey, oh! You know that guy who's been
following me? I talked to him today.

135
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,152
You talked to him?
Are you crazy?

136
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,991
Okay, first, I'm not crazy.
And second, say it. Don't spray it.

137
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,746
Anyway, his name is Malcolm,
and he wasn't following me.

138
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,790
I mean, he was, but just because
he thought I was Ursula. Ick.

139
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:07,338
And that's why- That's why he
couldn't just come up and talk to me.

140
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,799
Because of the restraining order.

141
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,679
Hmm. Not feeling better about Malcolm.

142
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,391
Oh! No, no, no, he's not like a kook.

143
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,687
No, he's just this, like, very passionate,
incredibly romantic guy...

144
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,565
...that just got a teensy bit
carried away, you know?

145
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,818
And we just get along really well,
and he's so cute.

146
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:34,908
Oh, my God. You've got a crush
on your sister's stalker.

147
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,036
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know,
get "de-Ursula-ized."

148
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,122
Like, you know- Like I did for Joey
after he went out with her.

149
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,666
Yeah, but I didn't stalk her. I mean....

150
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,752
I asked for the news,
not the weather.

151
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,757
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Mon.

152
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,219
Joey, this is for you.
It's blackberry currant.

153
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,678
Aw.

154
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,224
Oh.

155
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,558
Yeah.

156
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,852
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask.

157
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,231
The girl from the Xerox place,
buck naked...

158
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,359
...or a big tub of jam?

159
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,570
Put your hands together.

160
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,244
Joey, take your time with that.
That's my last batch.

161
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,454
No more jam?

162
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,582
What happened to your jam plan?

163
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,336
Well, I figured out I'd need to charge
17 bucks a jar just to break even.

164
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,840
So I've got a new plan now. Babies.

165
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,510
Well, you're gonna need
much bigger jars.

166
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,558
-What are you talking about?
-About me having a baby.

167
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,768
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

168
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,647
The great thing about the jam plan was
I was take control of my life.

169
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,692
So I asked myself, "What is
the most important thing to me?"

170
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,570
And that's when I came up
with the baby plan.

171
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,573
Well, aren't you forgetting something?

172
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,951
What is, uh~?
What is that guy's name? Dad.

173
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,998
It took me 28 years to find one man
that I wanted to spend my life with.

174
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,169
If I have to wait another 28 years,
then I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.

175
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,337
And that's just stupid.

176
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,757
That's what's stupid?

177
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,264
I don't need an actual man.
Just a couple of his best swimmers.

178
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,810
You know? And there are places
that you can go to get that stuff.

179
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,021
Down at the docks again?

180
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,783
Night-night, Bing-a-ling.

181
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,995
Night-night...

182
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,414
...Janice.

183
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,962
<i>Look at all that room on her side.</i>

184
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,006
<i>You could fit a giant penguin over there.</i>

185
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,885
<i>That'd be weird, though.</i>

186
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,888
<i>Hug and roll time.</i>

187
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,349
<i>I'm hugging. I'm hugging.</i>

188
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,310
<i>You're rolling, and....</i>

189
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,562
<i>Yes! Freedom!</i>

190
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,148
<i>Except for this arm.</i>

191
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,068
<i>I'm stuck. Stuck arm.</i>

192
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,697
<i>Okay, time for the old tablecloth trick.
One fluid motion.</i>

193
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,699
<i>Quick like a cat. Quick like a cat.</i>

194
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,994
<i>And one, two...</i>

195
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,621
<i>...three.</i>

196
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,004
Here's my binoculars.

197
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,632
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great.

198
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,010
You know, real strong. Going strong.
Keep going.

199
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,972
These are my night-vision goggles.

200
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,351
This is the book I pretend to read
when I'm watching her in the park.

201
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,480
And these are <i>Madlibs.
</i>They're just for fun.

202
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,691
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. What's this?

203
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:59,570
Oh. This is the log I kept,
recording her every movement.

204
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,700
-You want to hear something from it?
-Urn, not even a little bit.

205
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,161
-It's about you.
-Oh, okay, then.

206
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,253
-"I met Phoebe today.
-Ha, ha.

207
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,880
She was really nice to me
even though I'm such a loser."

208
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,257
Oh.

209
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,094
"And then when I was walking home,
I thought about her a lot.

210
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,389
It was weird but kind of cool."

211
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,933
Good. Ha, ha.

212
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,728
So, what were you thinking?

213
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,732
I was thinking what it'd be like
to kiss you.

214
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,066
-Really?
-No.

215
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,484
Oh.

216
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,906
See, that's just something I said now
so that maybe I could kiss you.

217
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,326
-Oh, okay.
-Ha!

218
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,126
No, it's all right.
I just had a jar of mustard.

219
00:13:56,586 --> 00:14:01,716
Okay. Sperm donor number 03815,
come on down!

220
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,594
Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds.

221
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,805
And he describes himself
as a male Geena Davis.

222
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,058
You mean there's more than one of us?

223
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,355
You can't do this, Mon, all right?
If you do this, I'm gonna-

224
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,316
-You're gonna what?
-I'm gonna tell Mom.

225
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,779
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right.
I love you, but you're crazy.

226
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,948
-Crazy.
-What? Why? Why is this crazy?

227
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,826
-So this isn't the ideal way to do something-
-Oh, it's not-

228
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,037
Lips moving. Still talking.

229
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,831
It may not be ideal...

230
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,292
...but I'm so ready.

231
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,170
You know, I see the way
Ben looks at you.

232
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,798
It makes me ache, you know?

233
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,133
Check it out. Jam crackers.

234
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,723
Okay. All right, how's this?

235
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,935
Twenty-seven. Italian-American guy.

236
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,770
He's an actor.

237
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,688
Born in Queens.

238
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,442
Wow. Big family. Seven sisters...

239
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,196
...and he's the only boy.

240
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,911
Oh, my God. Under personal comments:
"New York Knicks rule."

241
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,621
Yeah, the Knicks rule.

242
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,669
Joey, this is you.

243
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,504
Let me see.

244
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,007
Oh, right.

245
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,177
When did you go to a sperm bank?

246
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,139
Right after I did that sex study at NYU.

247
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,933
Hey, remember that sweater
I gave you for your birthday?

248
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,519
And that's how you bought it?

249
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,481
No. That's what I was wearing
when I donated.

250
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,237
I'm kind of surprised
there's any of my boys left.

251
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,614
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive.

252
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,367
I mean, I've got an actual
rocket scientist here.

253
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,286
Hey, maybe I should call this place...

254
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,955
...and get them to put my
<i>Days of our Lives </i>gig on here.

255
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,874
You know? Juice this puppy up a little.

256
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,252
-Hey!
-Hello.

257
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,670
How's the maniac?

258
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:06,132
Oh, he's yummy.
We did a little kissing. Aah!

259
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,718
Phoebe, what are you doing?

260
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,553
Oh, no, no, no. You know what?

261
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,890
He's not into that anymore.
He quit for me. Mm-hm.

262
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,727
Pheebs, this guy has been
obsessed with your sister...

263
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,896
...for God knows how long, okay?

264
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,064
You don't just give up something
like that.

265
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,693
Look, he gave me his night-vision
goggles and everything.

266
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,656
You're taking the word of a guy
who has night-vision goggles?

267
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,702
What? He's not still following her.
You think he's still following her?

268
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,955
Pheebs, wake up and smell
the restraining order.

269
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,250
What should I do?

270
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,504
I think that if you really like this guy,
you should just trust him.

271
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,922
Thank you, Monica.

272
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,674
Or you could follow him
and see where he goes.

273
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,177
Oh, that's what I would do. Forget mine.

274
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,681
Oh, my God. What happened?

275
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,434
Oh, God. Crazy Chandler,
he spun me...

276
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,394
...off the bed.

277
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:04,273
-Wow. Spinning. That sounds like fun.
-Oh.

278
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,109
I wish.

279
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:11,405
No, you know, he was just trying
Ross' "hug and roll" thing.

280
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,493
Ross' what?

281
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,039
You know, like, where he hugs you
and then he kind of rolls you away, and....

282
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,046
Oh, my God.

283
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,540
-Phoebe?
-Yes? Yes! Oh.

284
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,792
What are you doing?

285
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,587
Oh, I was just here
looking for my, urn....

286
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,632
My part of an old sandwich.
Here it is! Oh!

287
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,177
Were you following me?

288
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,263
Um, perhaps.

289
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,224
Yes. Yes. I'm sorry.

290
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:24,103
I'm sorry. I was just afraid
that you were still hung up on my sister.

291
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,439
So you spied on me.

292
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,233
I can't believe you don't trust me.

293
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:39,535
Oh, well, what do you know?
There goes my identical twin sister.

294
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,330
Just walking along, looking like me.

295
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:47,668
What is this, just a freakish coincidence,
or did you know that she takes this train?

296
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,630
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

297
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,049
I tried to stop, but I couldn't.

298
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,468
I'm so pathetic.

299
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:59,805
No, no, it's not your fault.
You know, it's partly my fault.

300
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,350
It's because I made you quit cold turkey.

301
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,768
It's too hard, you know?

302
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,938
Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you
anymore, because you're, you know:

303
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,607
Wow!

304
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,237
But, um- But I will definitely, definitely
help you get over my sister. Okay?

305
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,449
Just stalk me for a while, huh?

306
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,870
Yeah, and I'll be like an Ursula patch.

307
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,872
Uh-huh. I don't know.

308
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,750
Yeah, just- Okay, look, I'm going.

309
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,210
Um, come on.

310
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,256
Ooh, ooh, behind the pillar.
Ooh, which way am I gonna go? Aah!

311
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,259
-Hey.
-Hey.

312
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,011
-Where you going?
-To the bank.

313
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,806
Huh. Sperm or regular?

314
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,767
Sperm.

315
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,310
So you're really doing it, huh?

316
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,855
Oh, yeah. I picked a guy, 37135.

317
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,148
He sounds nice.

318
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,276
I'd say so.
He's got brown hair and green eyes.

319
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,362
No kidding? Hmm.

320
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,281
-What?
-I figured you'd have picked a blond guy.

321
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,242
Really? Why?

322
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,285
I don't know.
I always pictured you ending up...

323
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,956
...with one of those tall, smart, blond guys,
name like...

324
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,124
...Hoyt.

325
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,002
-Hoyt?
-It's a name. Yeah.

326
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:17,800
I saw you in this- You know,
this great house with a big pool.

327
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,678
-Yeah? Is he a swimmer?
-Ha.

328
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,556
He's got the body for it. Ha, ha.

329
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,808
I like that.

330
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,564
-Ha, ha. What?
-You guys have one of those signs that says:

331
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,442
"We don't swim in your toilet,
so don't pee in our pool."

332
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,694
We do not have one of those signs.

333
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,446
Sure you do. It was a gift from me.

334
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,908
Oh! And you have three great kids.

335
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,162
-Two girls and a boy?
-Yeah!

336
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,165
And they wear those little water wings,
you know...

337
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,000
...and they're running around
on the deck.

338
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,086
And then Hoyt wraps this big towel
around all three of them.

339
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,671
Sure.

340
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,597
Uh, but, hey, you know,
this way sounds good too.

341
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,683
Yeah.

342
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,855
Oh, Monica.

343
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,364
Wow, this guy's an astronaut?

344
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,285
That would have been cool...

345
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,913
...for, like, a day. Ah-ah!

346
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,421
I called the sperm bank today.

347
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,841
They haven't sold a single unit
of Tribbiani.

348
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,885
Nobody wants my product.

349
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,014
I mean, I don't get it, you know?

350
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,520
I mean...

351
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,314
...maybe if they met me in person.

352
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,734
Uh, honey, you got a little thing on your....

353
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,070
-Oh.
-Yeah.

354
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,115
Get it?

355
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,076
Yeah.

356
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,621
Hello.

357
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,457
Hello.

358
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,629
Hey.

359
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,090
Uh....

360
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,134
Chan, can I, uh-?
Could I talk to you for a second?

361
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,387
-Sure. What's up?
-Uh, ha, ha.

362
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,348
Just one, uh-
One additional relationship thought.

363
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,476
Um, something you're probably,
uh, already familiar with.

364
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,353
Uh, women talk.
