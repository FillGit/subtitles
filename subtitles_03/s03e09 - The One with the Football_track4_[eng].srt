1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,759
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.

2
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,303
You know, instead of watching football,
you could help.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,180
We know.

4
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:17,976
Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows
in concentric circles.

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,439
No, you want to put them
in concentric circles.

6
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,650
I want to do this.

7
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,078
Every year.

8
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,711
<i>To the 10, to the 5. Touchdown, Giants!</i>

9
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:31,174
You know, for once, I am gonna try
to watch one of these things.

10
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,760
Halftime.

11
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,932
Who wants to, uh, throw the ball around?
Get a little 3-on-3 going?

12
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,810
-Oh, that would be so much fun!
-Can I play too?

13
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,396
I've never played football, ever.

14
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,023
Great! You can cover Chandler.

15
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,402
I don't- I don't really want to play.

16
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,614
You never do anything
since you and Janice broke up.

17
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,823
Not true.

18
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,535
I wanted to wear my bathrobe
and eat peanut clusters all day.

19
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,997
And start drinking in the morning.
Don't say I don't have goals!

20
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,375
You have to start getting
over her, all right?

21
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:09,338
If you play, maybe it'll
take your mind off Janice.

22
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,967
If you don't, everyone will be mad at
you because the teams won't be even.

23
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:15,969
All right, I'll play.

24
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,388
-Yay!
-Yay! Let's do it! Ross?

25
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,515
-What?
-Wanna play football?

26
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,435
Urn....

27
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,688
Monica and I aren't supposed
to play football.

28
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,900
Says who? Your mom? Ha-ha-ha.

29
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,360
Yes.

30
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:37,908
Ahem. Every Thanksgiving, urn,
we used to have a touch football game...

31
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,701
...called The Geller Bowl.

32
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,204
No, no, no. You say that proudly!

33
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,708
Anyway, Ross and I
were always captains, and, urn....

34
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,545
It got kind of competitive.
And one year, Geller Bowl VI...

35
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,965
...I accidentally broke Ross' nose.

36
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,594
It was so not an accident.

37
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,846
She saw I was about to tag her,
so she threw...

38
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,141
...her big fat grandma-arm
elbow in my face...

39
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,227
...and just kept running.

40
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,396
To score the winning touchdown,
by the way.

41
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,189
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Heh.

42
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,234
Uh, you did not win the game.
The touchdown didn't count...

43
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:17,322
...because of the spectacularly illegal,
and savage, nose-breaking.

44
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,866
I won the game.

45
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,453
Yeah? Then how come you
didn't get the Geller Cup?

46
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,915
Ahem, there was a Geller Cup?

47
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,252
Yes, the trophy you got
if you won the game.

48
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,839
But Dad said nobody won,
and he was sick of our fighting.

49
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,258
So he took the trophy...

50
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,516
...threw it in the lake.

51
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,269
And was the curse lifted?

52
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,981
Anyway...

53
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,443
...Mom said we weren't
allowed to play football again.

54
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,988
You know what?
I think we should play a game.

55
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,031
I mean, come on. It's been 12 years.

56
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,951
Can I see you for a second?

57
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,457
Wuss!

58
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,001
All right, we're gonna play.

59
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,338
Wait. How we gonna get there?
My mom won't let me cross the street.

60
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,304
Here you go.

61
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,722
All right.

62
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,515
-Let's bring it in.
-Wait.

63
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,142
Honey, throw it to me!

64
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,561
-Here you go.
-Aah!

65
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,774
That almost hit me in the face!

66
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,734
We have to pick captains.

67
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,153
And then "Tennilles."

68
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,656
So how do we decide that?

69
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,075
-Why don't we just bunny up?
-What?

70
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,328
-Bunny!
-Bunny!

71
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,164
Looks like Ross and I are captains.

72
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:53,210
Okay, so, urn, I bunnied first,
so I get to pick first. Joey.

73
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,337
-Thank you.
-Monica.

74
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,339
I'm your best friend.

75
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,716
Sweetie, don't worry, you'll get picked.

76
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,718
Chandler.

77
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,639
-Ross?
-Phoebe.

78
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,977
Sweetie, now I pick you.

79
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,564
You don't pick me.
You're stuck with me!

80
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,900
Okay. All right. So let's see.

81
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,320
Let's play from the, uh,
trash can to the light post, right?

82
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,863
Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.

83
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,741
People, listen.
I've got 28 minutes...

84
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,077
...before I have to baste again.

85
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,204
Wow, just like in the pros.

86
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,540
-Okay, huddle up! Whoo!
-Woo-hoo.

87
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,418
-Huddle up over here!
-Wait for me! Wait for me!

88
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,504
Oh, cool! My first huddle.

89
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,506
-Okay.
-Ha, ha. Okay.

90
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,801
So what do you guys really think
of Chandler?

91
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:47,097
-You know what you're doing, right?
-Yeah.

92
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,558
Okay. Joey will catch it. We'll block.

93
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,393
What's "block"?

94
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,689
-I thought you knew what you were doing.
-I thought you meant in life!

95
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,233
Break!

96
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,611
The ball is Janice.
The ball is Janice.

97
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,202
Ow! Son of a—! Ow!

98
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,413
-Come on!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

99
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,082
You know what?
We're just gonna throw it.

100
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,918
I got it!

101
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,503
Go, go, go!

102
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,473
Score! Seven to nothing!

103
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:31,975
Honey, you okay?

104
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,476
Come on, let's go.

105
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,312
Whoo. Losers walk.

106
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,148
Yeah? Losers talk.

107
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,942
No, no, actually, losers rhyme.

108
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,362
Forty-three...

109
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,614
...74....

110
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,286
-You wanna go shotgun?
-Yeah.

111
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,873
Hike.

112
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,959
-One Mississippi....
-Over here! Over here! Unh.

113
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,045
Ha! I almost caught that one!

114
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,633
Great. Now the score's
seven to almost seven.

115
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:09,804
Okay, on this play, I want you to do
a down-and-out to the right, okay?

116
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,765
-Break!
-Wait. What am I gonna do?

117
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,224
You?

118
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,434
You go long.

119
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,894
How long?

120
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,896
Until we start to look very small.

121
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,774
-Okay. Break!
-Break!

122
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,984
-Set, hike!
-One Mississippi-

123
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,861
Switch! Switch! Switch!

124
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,780
No, no, no, no!

125
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,954
Huhh....

126
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,166
Hey. Thanks for stopping our ball.

127
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,293
You are playing American football?

128
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,503
Yeah.

129
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,714
Wow, you're, like,
from a whole other country!

130
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,551
-I'm Dutch.
-Hi, I'm Joey.

131
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,261
I am Margha.

132
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,057
-Sorry, Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
-Ha-ha-ha.

133
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,893
You wanna play football or-?
Hi, I'm Chandler.

134
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,937
Hello, Chandler.

135
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,524
Her name is Dutch and also "Margham."

136
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,276
-Margha.
-Margha.

137
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,569
Margha.

138
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,447
Mahan.

139
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,784
Come on, guys! Let's go!
Second down!

140
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,788
-Uh, hello? It's third down.
-No, it's not. It's second.

141
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,999
-Wow.
-"Wow" what?

142
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,087
It just amazes me that you're
still pulling stuff like this. Heh.

143
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,717
-Pulling what? It's second down.
-Okay, it's second down.

144
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,636
Take all the second downs you need.

145
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,556
-I heard that.
-Well, I said it loud.

146
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,560
It is okay if I stay and watch?

147
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,896
-Just sit right there.
-Yeah, why don't you stick around?

148
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,773
-That went well.
-I think so.

149
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,901
I was thinking about, uh,
asking her for her number.

150
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,947
Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger
statement if I ask for it myself.

151
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:57,912
I was thinking about for me, as part
of that getting-over-Janice thing.

152
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,123
Oh, yeah. That.

153
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,876
If it means that much,
I'll let you have her.

154
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,127
Thanks.

155
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,130
Wh~? "Let me have her"?

156
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,592
You mean if you didn't,
I wouldn't have a shot?

157
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,595
I don't like to say it out loud...

158
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,388
...but yeah!

159
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,143
We all have our strengths.
You're better with numbers and stuff.

160
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,897
Math? You're giving me math?

161
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,150
All right, you know what?
Forget about it.

162
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,694
You go for the girl.
We'll see who gets her.

163
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,035
I want you to run a post-pattern
to the left. And, sweetie-

164
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,536
Yeah, I know. Go long.

165
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,289
All I'm doing is running
back and forth from the huddle.

166
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,586
Well, uh, you wanna just stay out there?

167
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,255
-Can I see that for a second?
-Yeah.

168
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,469
-Okay.
-Okay, let's go.

169
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,179
-I got Chandler
-Hike!

170
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,973
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

171
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,683
Fumble!

172
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,651
What's the matter with you?
This is my favorite jersey.

173
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,278
Well, now you have two.

174
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,657
Hey, I am good at math!

175
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,868
That's it.
I was still gonna let you have her.

176
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,788
But now,
prepare to feel bad about yourself.

177
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,291
I've been preparing for that
my entire life!

178
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,169
Or something about you that's mean!

179
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,505
Come on, guys. Let's go.

180
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,590
Tie score.
We're running out of time.

181
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,259
Forty-two, 38, hike!

182
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,679
I got it! Ooh! Ugh!

183
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,139
Broken boobs! Ow.

184
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,725
-Pheebs, run!
-Run, Phoebe! Run!

185
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,937
-God! Touchdown! Touchdown!
-Yes! Touchdown! Hey, oh!

186
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,023
No, no, no.

187
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,860
Uh, the buzzer buzzed.
It doesn't count.

188
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,112
-After the snap.
-Before the snap.

189
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,488
-After.
-Before.

190
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,407
-Does it really matter?
-Yes!

191
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,286
But I made a touchdown.
It was my first touchdown.

192
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,247
Pheebs, that's great. Doesn't count.

193
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,041
-Does so count.
-Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.

194
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,712
Oh, my God!

195
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,675
That's fine. Maybe you haven't
grown up, but I have.

196
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,594
-Oh, okay.
-Dead leg!

197
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,679
Ugh, oh! Oh.

198
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,266
Okay, fine. You want to win
by cheating, go ahead.

199
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,393
The touchdown does count. You win.

200
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,687
-Whoo! Yay!
-No!

201
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,650
I won't do this again. I wanna
beat you when you can't blame it...

202
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,738
...on the broken nose or the buzzer
or the fact that you might have mono.

203
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,366
Let's just call this tie score
and it's halftime.

204
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,118
First, I don't play with cheaters.

205
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,288
Second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!

206
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,584
You know what? I think you'll play.

207
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,003
Oh, really? Why's that?

208
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,047
Because the winner gets this.

209
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,841
The Geller Cup!

210
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,347
Is everybody else seeing
a troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?

211
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,765
Mm-hm.

212
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,059
Okay, good.

213
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,524
Okay, where the hell did you get that?

214
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,985
When you went to the hospital
for your nose...

215
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,988
...I swam into the lake
and fished it out.

216
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,281
That cup is mine!

217
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,576
No, it's not. You want it,
you're gonna have to win it.

218
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,038
So are we not having dinner at all?

219
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:31,000
Come on, let's go.
It's time to get serious. Huddle up.

220
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,544
Keep your head in the game.

221
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,048
It's hard, you know?
His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.

222
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,053
If I take Chandler out of the running,
will you be able to focus?

223
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,181
-What are you gonna do?
-Just make sure he catches the ball.

224
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,349
I'll do the rest.

225
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,435
-Come on, you wuss!
-Okay, come on.

226
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,063
-Go, Cha- Chandler.
-I got it!

227
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,357
Come on! This way! Come on!

228
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,526
-Look out!
-Oof!

229
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,779
Whoa, whoa.

230
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,032
Tackled by a girl!
Bet you don't see that every day.

231
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,703
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's with the tackling?

232
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,705
What?

233
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,581
I just touched him and he went over.

234
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,752
Okay. You wanna play rough?
We can play rough.

235
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,880
<i>Let's get ready to rumble!</i>

236
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,148
Aah!

237
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,922
-Go, go, go!
-Get her! Get her!

238
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,636
I love this game!

239
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,891
Where'd you get that?

240
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,602
I went really long.

241
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,813
Forty-two to 21.

242
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,441
Like the turkey, Ross is done!

243
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,279
You got to pick first,
so you got the better team.

244
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,449
Pathetic! Why can't you
just accept that we're winning...

245
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,950
...because I'm better than you?

246
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,996
-Pfft!
-Oh, what a great argument. Exhaling!

247
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,499
All right, I'll prove it to you. Okay?

248
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,586
I'll trade you Joey for Rachel
and I'll still win the game.

249
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,130
What? The guys against the girls?

250
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,842
That's ridiculous because
I'm only down by three touchdowns.

251
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,761
Oh, then bring it on!

252
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,223
Unless you're afraid you might lose
to a bunch of girls.

253
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,812
Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica.
Joey, you're with me.

254
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,147
I can not believe you're trading me.

255
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,484
Let's see what it's like
to be on a winning team for a change.

256
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,319
You're gonna let me play?

257
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,279
All right, then!

258
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,907
The game is over? We eat now?

259
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,992
No, the game's not over.
We're switching teams.

260
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,539
Chandler finds me so intimidating that
it's better if we're on the same team.

261
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,791
Okay, let's play. Let's go.

262
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,376
Oh, uh, hold on a second.

263
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,087
Ahem.
Where do Dutch people come from?

264
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,513
Uh, well, the, uh...

265
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,933
...Pennsylvania Dutch
come from Pennsylvania.

266
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,519
And the, uh, other Dutch people?

267
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,480
They come from somewhere near
the Netherlands, right?

268
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,524
Nice try.

269
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,943
The Netherlands
is this make-believe place...

270
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,113
...where Peter Pan
and Tinker Bell come from.

271
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,866
Oh, my.

272
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,703
Enough "geography for the insane."
Let's play ball.

273
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,247
No. No, I'm not playing with this guy.

274
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:59,000
-Oh, fine with me.
-I've had enough of this.

275
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:03,087
Let's just cut to the chase.
Heidi, which of my boys do you like?

276
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,089
What are you doing?

277
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,883
-What are you doing?
-Shh, shh.

278
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,094
Which do I like?

279
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:14,015
Yeah, for dating, general merriment,
taking back to your windmill?

280
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,268
Well, if I had to choose right now...

281
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,146
...which, by the way,
I find really weird...

282
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,649
...I would have to say Chandler.

283
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,401
Yes!

284
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,572
Wait a minute.
She didn't understand the question.

285
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,950
Why don't you have Captain Hook
explain it to her?

286
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,370
I'm sorry. That is my truth.

287
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,124
You hear that? That is her truth,
Mr. "I'll Let You Have Her"!

288
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,085
I win! You suck! I rule all!

289
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,880
Mini-wave in celebration of me!

290
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,883
Woo-hoo!

291
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:55,014
I am now thinking I would like
to change my answer to "no one."

292
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,766
What?

293
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,852
I now find you shallow, and, um...

294
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,771
...a dork.

295
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,856
Bye-bye.

296
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,858
Heh. Nice going.

297
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,694
You just saved yourself
a couple months of sex.

298
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,906
It doesn't matter,
because she picked me.

299
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,158
From now on, I get the dates...

300
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,954
...and you stay home on Saturday nights
watching <i>Ready, Set, Cook!</i>

301
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,374
Save the breakthroughs for therapy.
The clock is ticking.

302
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,252
We have no time,
and we are losing to girls.

303
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,045
We're not gonna lose to girls.

304
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,797
It's 42-21!

305
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,425
This sucks! I was just up by that much!

306
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,930
Are we playing football or what?
Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!

307
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,851
We have to do this.
We're playing for women everywhere.

308
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,562
Think about every lousy date
you ever had.

309
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,774
Every guy who kept one eye
on the TV while you were making out.

310
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,194
Oh, my God. You dated someone
with a glass eye too?

311
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,992
Come on, okay? This is for
all womankind. Let's kill them!

312
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,868
Yeah! Kill them!

313
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,414
All right, I want to kill them too.

314
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,249
But they're boys.

315
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,377
You know, how are we gonna
beat three boys?

316
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,576
A minute and a half left,
and we're down by two points.

317
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:39,952
Two points, ladies.

318
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,377
Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.

319
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,920
Rachel, you go long.

320
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,841
No, don't make me go long.
Use me. They never cover me.

321
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,760
Honey, there's a reason.

322
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,764
I'm not lame, okay?
I can do something.

323
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,516
Would you let me throw?
This is my game too.

324
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,393
Let her throw the ball.

325
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,272
Sweep behind, I'll pitch it.
You throw it downfield to Phoebe.

326
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,523
Thank you.

327
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,067
-Break!
-Break!

328
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,902
All right, here we go.

329
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,363
Thirty-two, 71, hike!

330
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,948
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi!

331
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,997
Go, go, go!

332
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,124
-Catch it!
-Ow!

333
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,421
-I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
-No, I'm not okay!

334
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,217
They were coming at me,
and I didn't know what to do.

335
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,469
-Thirty seconds left on the timer.
-Woo-hoo.

336
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,764
So we get to take that, uh,
stupid troll thing home.

337
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,892
Come on! Hurry!
We're running out of time.

338
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,769
-Huddle up!
-Okay.

339
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,107
Oh! This is our last huddle!

340
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,944
All right, Phoebe, get open. Rachel...

341
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,613
-...go long.
-Okay.

342
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,490
Break!

343
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,415
Ann! I did it! Touchdown! We did it!

344
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:57,465
You know? Funny thing, actually.
The end zone starts at that pole.

345
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,675
So you're five feet short. So...

346
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,553
-...ha-ha-ha, we win!
-Whoo!

347
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,306
Yes, yes, yes!

348
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,516
Wait, explain something, though.

349
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:12,021
If nobody tagged Rachel,
then isn't the play still going?

350
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,737
-Let me in! Let me in!
-No way! Let go!

351
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,865
Let go? I'm a tiny little woman!

352
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,326
Guys, come on, it's Thanksgiving!

353
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,870
It's not important who wins or loses.

354
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,998
The important thing
is the Dutch girl picked me!

355
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,171
Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler!
Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!

356
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,718
Ow!

357
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,972
We should play football
more often.

358
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,642
Maybe there's a league
we could join.

359
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,937
Isn't there a "national football league"?

360
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,607
Yes, there is. They play on
Sundays and Monday nights.

361
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,401
Oh, shoot! I work Monday nights.

362
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,903
A ww.

363
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,950
This stuffing is amazing.
Do you think we should bring them some?

364
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,202
When they're hungry, they'll come in.

365
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,247
-Let go!
-No, you let go!

366
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,252
How come it's always us
left holding the ball?

367
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:20,256
I don't know. I guess the other
people just don't care enough.

368
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,806
Hey, it's starting to snow.

369
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,230
-Give it to me! Let go!
-Let it go! Come on, let go!
