1
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,173
Can I see the comics?

2
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,258
This is the <i>New York Times.</i>

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,595
Okay, may I see the comics?

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,766
I thought you were
taking Ross to the game.

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,269
-We are. He's meeting us here.
-No, Rachel's meeting us here.

6
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,313
Come on.
They can be in the same room.

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,483
-You should've been there last night.
-What happened?

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,360
Ross was hanging out at our place.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,071
Rachel comes to borrow
moisturizer from Chandler-

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,280
Hey.

11
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,033
How hard is it to say "something"?

12
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,536
Rachel came over to borrow "something."

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,250
Anyway, her and Ross just started
yelling at each other.

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,920
Why was he yelling at her?
He slept with someone else.

15
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,422
He says they were on a break
when it happened...

16
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,466
...so she should've
forgiven him by now.

17
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,719
He is so unreasonable. God.

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,055
Although I understand what he means.

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,976
Oh, my God.
This is like <i>60 Minutes...</i>

20
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,104
...when at first you're mad
at that pharmaceutical company...

21
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,272
...for making the drug.

22
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,149
And then, you just feel bad
for the people because...

23
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,944
...they needed
to make their hair grow.

24
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,823
You know, this is like
when my parents got divorced.

25
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,201
I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me
after Cub Scouts.

26
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:22,249
I dreamed that Ross and Rachel
were still together.

27
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,418
And we were all
hanging out and happy.

28
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,836
I had the same dream.

29
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:30,757
-And nobody slept with the Xerox girl.
-Oh, I had the opposite dream.

30
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,928
Maybe it's gonna be okay.
I mean, it's been a week.

31
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,806
It never takes me more than a week
to get over a relationship.

32
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,143
It never takes you more than a shower
to get over a relationship.

33
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:47,649
Let's go. Let's hit the road.
Let's get the show on it.

34
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,900
Let me get coffee.

35
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,153
I know the best coffeehouse.
And it's close.

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,863
Closer than here?

37
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,824
Oh, look. I found coffee.

38
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,451
Okay, let's skedaddle.

39
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,162
I'm not gonna drink
somebody's old coffee.

40
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,997
Okay, Your Highness.

41
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:14,051
"Rachel, I'm really sorry."
"Okay, Ross. Wanna get back together?"

42
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,260
"Yeah, okay."

43
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,888
Did anyone else hear that?

44
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,449
-Is he here?
-No.

45
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,451
Here's your moisturizer.

46
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,788
Hi.

47
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,083
You guys are gonna love me.
Okay, check it out.

48
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,168
Thursday night, five tickets.

49
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,756
Calvin Klein lingerie show,
and you guys are coming with me.

50
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,178
I said that out loud, right?

51
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,974
Yes, it's just that
we kind of already...

52
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,226
...made plans with Ross.

53
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,605
Oh. Well, okay.

54
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,190
Well, there you go.

55
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,776
It's just, he got this new
home-theater dealy...

56
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,903
...and he wants us to check it out.

57
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,780
He's excited about it too.

58
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,075
He even recorded showtimes
on his answering machine.

59
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,619
-We're sorry, honey.
-Oh, it's okay.

60
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,331
Rach, it's not that
we don't want to. Really.

61
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,960
Are we talking models
in their underwear?

62
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,670
And heels.

63
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,844
Ross did ask us first,
and we set that night aside.

64
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,431
Come on. If he asked you first,
it's only fair.

65
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,437
Oh, boy, do I feel bad.

66
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,314
Very bad.

67
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,357
-Chandler, what are you doing?
-Chandler.

68
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,110
Oh, my God.

69
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,404
You're smoking again?

70
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,324
Well, actually,
yesterday I was smoking again.

71
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,867
Today I'm smoking, still.

72
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,622
Why would you start again
after chewing all that quitting gum?

73
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,541
This is just like
my parents' divorce...

74
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,044
...which is when
I first started smoking.

75
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,755
Weren't you 9?

76
00:04:58,757 --> 00:04:59,799
Yeah.

77
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,306
I'm telling you something,
that first smoke after naptime....

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,685
That's great.
With my luck, that's him.

79
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,312
Him? Ross?

80
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,191
No, "Hymn" 253:
"His Eyes Are on the Sparrow."

81
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:22,572
When my parents got divorced, I started
using humor as a defense mechanism.

82
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,286
Hi. Uh, do you guys have
weekend plans?

83
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:33,625
Because my sister says we can spend
the weekend at her cabin, skiing.

84
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,255
I'm asking you first, right?
I'm playing by the rules.

85
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,673
Absolutely.

86
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,843
Chandler. You're smoking?
What are you doing?

87
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,345
Shut up.
You're not my real mom.

88
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,730
Could you close that window?
My nipples could cut glass.

89
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,528
Really? Because mine
get me out of tickets.

90
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:09,286
Look, I just wanna say I really
appreciate you spending time with me.

91
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,623
It's been a hard time right now,
so I just want to say thanks.

92
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,002
Somebody else hug him.
I have to stay by the window.

93
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,380
Oh, hey, hey.

94
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,342
How about this weekend, we have
a laser-disc marathon, okay?

95
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,637
And maybe a tournament
on my new...

96
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,266
...dart board. What do you think?

97
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,893
Two days of darts. It'll be great.

98
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,272
It'll be great for next weekend.

99
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,149
This weekend, guys.

100
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,443
It'll be great for next weekend.

101
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,321
I mean, "It'll be great."

102
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,491
What's going on?

103
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:53,747
We're, um, sort of invited to go skiing.
You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?

104
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,961
So, for the whole weekend?

105
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,882
We're really sorry,
but she did ask us first.

106
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,345
That's okay. If you
all have to go away...

107
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,431
...for the first weekend I'm
alone by myself...

108
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,475
...then I totally understand.

109
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,269
I can stay. I'm gonna stay.

110
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,981
The last time I went,
I was afraid to leave the chair lift.

111
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,858
I just went round and round.

112
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,363
We need you to drive us there
in your grandmother's cab.

113
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:31,284
-But you know what? I'll stay.
-No, I'll stay. He's my brother.

114
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,536
-What, a "pity stay"?
-No.

115
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,665
We're gonna have fun.

116
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,000
We can make fudge.

117
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,545
Pity food?

118
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,466
You know what?
I don't need any of you to stay.

119
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,093
Nobody stays.

120
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,929
Well, then I might as well
offer to stay.

121
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,229
Hey....

122
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,815
Does anybody else feel bad about Ross?

123
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,274
You think he's still mad?

124
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,696
He's probably more mad since
you called him to borrow his goggles.

125
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,531
What? Mine aren't tinted.

126
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,868
Chandler.

127
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,245
What?

128
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,539
What does the sign say?

129
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,292
"Beam me up, Jesus."

130
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,586
The "No Smoking" sign.

131
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,506
There's no smoking
in my grandmother's cab.

132
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,051
Well, then I have to go
to the bathroom.

133
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,928
Oh, please.

134
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:35,056
No unscheduled stops.
You can go when we stop for gas.

135
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:39,894
There's a rest stop right up there.
Come on, I really have to go.

136
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,023
Oh, now I have to go.

137
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,450
Here we go.

138
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,285
-Brace yourself.
-What?

139
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,580
Okay. Ow.

140
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,921
-Aren't you gonna go?
-No, thanks.

141
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,841
Rachel never pees in public restrooms.

142
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,594
They never have any paper in there.

143
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,680
So my rule is, "No tissue, no tushy."

144
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,481
Well, if everybody's going....

145
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,984
Don't close it.
The keys are in there.

146
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,569
Oh, no, no, no, no.

147
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,655
-What's going on?
-My lighter's in there.

148
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,373
Damn. The tailpipe's
not hot enough to light this.

149
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,753
I can open this.
Anybody got a coat hanger?

150
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,962
Oh, I do.

151
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,716
No, I took it out of my shirt
when I put it on this morning.

152
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,470
So if your parents hadn't divorced...

153
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,973
...you'd be able to answer a question
like a normal person?

154
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,229
Look, I just need a wire something
to jimmy it.

155
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,523
One of you give me
your bra underwire.

156
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,899
What?

157
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,277
Come on.
Who has the biggest boobs?

158
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:16,407
Whoever has the biggest boobs,
has the biggest bra and wire.

159
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,284
-No.
-It's too expensive.

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,955
To get back in the car,
we need that wire.

161
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,414
Your call.

162
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,586
Monica's are the biggest.

163
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:35,260
These tiny little non-breasts?
Please. It's gotta be Rachel.

164
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,429
No, mine are deceptively small.

165
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,433
I mean, I actually sometimes
stuff my bra.

166
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,521
Well, then your bra would
still be big.

167
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,190
No, I stuff outside the bra.

168
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,485
Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?

169
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,071
Phoebe, Rachel,
take off Monica's bra.

170
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,991
All right, forget it, never mind.

171
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,118
-You can have mine.
-Thank you.

172
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:06,124
Chandler. What are you doing?
There's a trash can right there.

173
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,920
I thought if I littered, that crying
Indian might come by and save us.

174
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:14,924
There.

175
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,887
Thank you, Phoebe.
That's very, very generous.

176
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,973
Now, let's decide
who has the nicest ass.

177
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,227
And there you go.

178
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,233
Chandler.

179
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,528
Well, at least let me smoke it
to the good part.

180
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,122
Oh, no.

181
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,959
-What's going on?
-What?

182
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,629
Yeah, this has happened before.

183
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,799
-So you know how to fix it?
-Yep. Put more gas in.

184
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,644
Hi. What are you doing here?

185
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,188
I was wondering,
when you and I split up...

186
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,525
...did you get the tape that was
half the last episode of <i>M.A.S.H...</i>

187
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,945
...and half the hostages coming home?

188
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:22,033
But now it's Susan and me in Mexico
and the hostages coming home.

189
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,534
Where's Ben?

190
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,994
-He's sleeping.
-Ah. Ooh.

191
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,123
Is this a bad time?

192
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,168
Yeah, actually.
Susan's gonna be here any minute.

193
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,545
-It's kind of an anniversary.
-Oh.

194
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,173
I thought you guys
got married in January.

195
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,092
A different kind of anniversary.

196
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,510
Oh.

197
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,345
Oh.

198
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,640
So anyway-

199
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,809
Candles, champagne....

200
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,603
Yeah, anniversaries are great...

201
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,606
...because love lasts forever,
you know?

202
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,694
There's nothing like it
in this life. Money in the bank.

203
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,696
So Rachel and I broke up.

204
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,783
God, Ross, I am so sorry.

205
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,286
You know what?

206
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,579
I wanna talk about this so much...

207
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,082
...but when we can really get into it.

208
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,584
-You free for dinner tomorrow?
-I'd love that.

209
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,752
Me too.

210
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,589
I guess it all started
when Rachel got this new job.

211
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,969
Triple A can pick us up.

212
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,138
What town are we near?

213
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,515
Freemont. Westmont.

214
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,142
Uh, Westberg?

215
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,269
Why are you answering?

216
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,188
Do you know
what route we're on?

217
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,442
We are definitely on Route 27.

218
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,653
We are at a rest stop on Route 27-

219
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,613
There is no Route 27.

220
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,366
-Either 93 or 76.
-I don't know.

221
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,119
I always slept in the back
when we drove here.

222
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:54,042
Can you just send someone up and down
76 and check every rest stop?

223
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,085
And also 93?

224
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,671
Okay.

225
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,173
No, they don't do that.

226
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,678
Somebody will come and save us.

227
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,265
Who? Have you seen a car
in the last hour and a half?

228
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,602
We should call Ross.
Maybe he can get a car to get us.

229
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,104
I am not getting in a car with Ross.

230
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,065
We will just have to...

231
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,232
...live here.

232
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,235
-But it's so cold.
-No.

233
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,906
I won't get in a car with him.
Think of something else.

234
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,657
Joey and Chandler are back.

235
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,205
-So the going-for-help went well?
-Oh, yeah.

236
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,542
Smokey Joe here got halfway
to the highway and collapsed.

237
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,045
I have the lung capacity
of a 2-year-old.

238
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,172
Then why are you smoking?

239
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,757
It's very unsettling.

240
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,846
Right? I mean,
it's pretty unbelievable.

241
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,683
They just took off
without even looking back.

242
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,896
I don't need them.
I've got you guys now as friends.

243
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,231
You and Susan.

244
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,150
Susan will be so pleased.

245
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,862
Seven-one-seven?

246
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,572
Where's 717?

247
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,411
You have more of these
for Susan, right?

248
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,121
No, but that's okay.

249
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,957
I'll just put out pickles
or something.

250
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,046
-Ross, thank God.
-<i>Pheebs?</i>

251
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,756
Why are you whispering?

252
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,217
I ate a bug.

253
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,138
Hey, Rach. The tampons here
are only a penny.

254
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,014
Let's stock up.

255
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:37,395
We're out of gas and don't know where
we are, so we can't get a tow truck.

256
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,399
-Oh. Now you want a favor?
-Yes, please.

257
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,110
I'm sorry your
car broke down, Pheebs...

258
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,572
...but I'm too busy with some of
my real friends right now.

259
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,575
But please call to let me know
you got home safely.

260
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,660
Phoebe, hang on a second.

261
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,620
Take my car.
Get your friends.

262
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,456
No, I won't pick them up.

263
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,667
We both know you'll do it
because you're not a jerk.

264
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,879
So you can sulk here for half an hour,
then go get them...

265
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,048
-...or save time and sulk in the car.
-Rachel doesn't-

266
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,468
I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark...

267
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,220
...and you're the innocent victim
in this.

268
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,265
But don't punish your friends
for what Rachel did.

269
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,894
Yeah, you're right.

270
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,230
Phoebe, hang on.
Ross wants to say something.

271
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,150
What? You slept with someone else?

272
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,778
We were on a break.

273
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,282
We were- Yeah.

274
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,577
Where are you? I'll find you.

275
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,287
You slept with another woman?

276
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,123
Oh, you're one to talk.

277
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,213
Okay, done.

278
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,508
What's "pleh"?

279
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,886
That's "help" spelled backwards...

280
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,223
...so that the helicopters can read it
from the air.

281
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,810
Ha. What's "dufus" spelled backwards?

282
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,481
Car. Car.

283
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,779
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives.

284
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,030
Hey.

285
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,533
What is he doing here?

286
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,660
He is saving your butt.

287
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,037
Unless I'm stepping on
some toes here...

288
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,081
...in which case,
I could just mosey on.

289
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,792
I have plenty of people to help
on the interstate.

290
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,378
-Come on.
-We need your help, please.

291
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,546
Fine. Fine.

292
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:35,054
Oh, no. Now it's
not gonna make any sense.

293
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,015
You guys...

294
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,519
...what do we do about Ross?
He drove all the way up here.

295
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,021
Just send him back,
then we'll go skiing?

296
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,149
This is horrible.
It's just horrible.

297
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,944
Should we ask Ross to come along?

298
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,239
But what about Rachel?
How are we gonna even ask her?

299
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,074
Ask me what?

300
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,663
If, uh, it might be okay if
Ross came skiing?

301
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,624
No, I wasn't gonna ask that.

302
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,754
You guys are unbelievable.
No, he cannot come.

303
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,132
-Excuse me?
-It's horrible.

304
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:16,595
Oh, please? Can't I come
to your special, magical cabin?

305
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,516
Why would you even want to come?
You're a horrible skier.

306
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,561
Oh. Hitting me where it hurts.
My ski skills.

307
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,771
Here we go again.

308
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,607
I can't handle this, you guys.

309
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,026
I can handle it.
"Handle" is my middle name.

310
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,863
Actually, it's the middle part
of my first name.

311
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,658
All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready.

312
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:38,868
Let's go.

313
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,578
You're welcome.

314
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,498
I'm sorry. Were you speaking
to me, or sleeping with someone else?

315
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,084
We were on a break.

316
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,880
Why don't you just put that
on your answering machine?

317
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,883
It's valid, and I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

318
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,301
Monica agrees with me.

319
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,094
What?

320
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,388
I don't know.

321
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,099
You said it last night.

322
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,770
What I said
was that I understood.

323
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,773
Joey is the one who agreed with you.

324
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,691
Really, Joey?

325
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,277
What?

326
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,490
You know what?
There is no right or wrong here.

327
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,201
I think it's very obvious
who's wrong here.

328
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,453
Obviously not to Joey.

329
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,207
What?

330
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:31,295
-Joey and Monica feel like I do.
-You and this innocent act.

331
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,340
Hey, guess who I am?

332
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,974
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

333
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,061
Look what you're doing to Chandler.

334
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:54,360
Look. We know that this is
really, really hard for you guys.

335
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,363
You don't have to love each other.

336
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,242
You don't even have to like
each other much right now.

337
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,286
But please find a way
to be around each other.

338
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,123
And not put us in the middle.

339
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:12,336
Otherwise, I mean, that's just it
for us hanging out together.

340
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,588
Is that what you want?

341
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,134
Can you be civil?

342
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,513
-Yeah.
-I can.

343
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,684
Good, let's get back in the car.
It's freezing...

344
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,728
...and my chest is unsupported.

345
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,896
Wait a second.

346
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,941
I mean, what are we doing?
Who's going with who?

347
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,698
Look, you guys should go.

348
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,201
You know,
you planned this all out...

349
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,414
...and I don't wanna ruin it.
So just go.

350
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,708
-You drove all the way up here.
-No, no, no.

351
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,210
I've gotta take
the car back anyway.

352
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,671
I'm spending all day
tomorrow with Ben.

353
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,050
It's fine, okay? Just go.
No guilt, I promise.

354
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,970
Thank you.

355
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,183
We'll call you when we get back.

356
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,061
Maybe we can, like,
go to a movie or something.

357
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,772
Or the rodeo.

358
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,609
-That would be great.
-Okay.

359
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:21,071
I was being Shelley Winters
from <i>The Poseidon Adventure.</i>

360
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,158
I know.

361
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,876
Bye.

362
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,736
-Ross.
-Hi. Sorry I'm late.

363
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,447
-Were you sleeping?
-Uh, no.

364
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,990
Oh, great.

365
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,453
I had to get you a new battery.
I got the best I could.

366
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,497
You don't want to skimp there.

367
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,831
You're a genius.

368
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,542
It came to about $112.

369
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,169
But what the hell,
call it an even 110?

370
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,631
I'll pay you tomorrow. Bye.

371
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,300
So they, uh, all took off.

372
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:26,637
It was pretty hard
watching them go, you know?

373
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,472
Yeah, okay. Bye.

374
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,770
So I'm gonna take off then.
