1
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:08,884
Welcome, everybody.
Welcome to <i>Amazing Discoveries.</i>

2
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,595
Oh, oh! It's on again.

3
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,640
-Guys, could we please not watch this?
-Shh.

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:18,185
<i>Folks, this ever happen to you?
You go to get a nice glass of milk...</i>

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,647
<i>...but these darn cartons are so
flinging, flanging hard to open.</i>

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,774
<i>Boy, you said it, Mike.</i>

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,109
<i>Aw. Aw.</i>

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,030
<i>-There's gotta be a better way.
-And there is, Kevin.</i>

9
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,450
-Can we please turn this off?
-No way, Kevin.

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,371
<i>What if I told you
there's a new product that guarantees...</i>

11
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,499
<i>...you'll never have to open up
milk cartons again?</i>

12
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,918
<i>Meet the Milkmaster 2000.</i>

13
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,503
<i>Ooh.</i>

14
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,798
-Intrigued?
-You're flinging, flanging right I am.

15
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:54,054
<i>This is his first time. He's never used this.
You're gonna see how easy this is to do.</i>

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,016
<i>-This works in any milk carton.
-Wow, it is easy. Ha, ha.</i>

17
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,602
<i>Now I can have milk every day.</i>

18
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,020
<i>Ah.</i>

19
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,241
It's official. There are no good movies.

20
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,994
So let's go to a bad one and make out.

21
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,582
Ew.

22
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:08,086
Perhaps you would like me to turn like this
so you can bunny-bump against my back?

23
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,881
-Hey.
-Hey.

24
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,925
-Hey, man. What's up?
-Maybe you can tell me.

25
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,888
My agent would like to know
why I didn't show up at my audition today...

26
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,933
...the first good thing she gets me in weeks.
How could you not give me the message?

27
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,519
I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt...

28
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,813
...but it wasn't me.

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,940
Yes, it was. It was him. Uh-huh.

30
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,235
Okay, it was me.

31
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,741
-How was it you?
-Well, it was all so crazy, you know?

32
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,994
Chandler was in the closet
counting to 10 and was up to seven...

33
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,163
...and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.

34
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,960
Look, I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all
down on my hand. See? All of it.

35
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,254
-Yep, that's my audition.
-Yeah.

36
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,424
See? Now, this is why I keep
notepads everywhere.

37
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,511
Yep. And that's why we don't
invite you to play.

38
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,099
What is the great tragedy here?
Get yourself another appointment.

39
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,395
Well, Estelle tried. The casting director
told her I missed my chance.

40
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,813
Well, that is unfair.

41
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,649
I'll call her.
I'll tell her it was totally my fault.

42
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,777
You can't.
The casting director doesn't talk to friends.

43
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,280
-She only talks to agents.
-What a sad little life she must lead.

44
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,784
Okay. Ooh.

45
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:24,579
-What are you doing? What are you doing?
-No, I know, I know. Ooh.

46
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,333
Hi, this is Caitlin
from Phoebe Buffay's office.

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,254
Um, is, um, Anne there for Phoebe?

48
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,756
She'll know what it's about.

49
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,883
Hang up. Hang up right-

50
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,972
Annie? Hi. Listen, we've got
a problem with Joey Tribbiani.

51
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,684
Apparently, he missed his audition.
Who did you speak to in my office?

52
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,270
Estelle? I don't know
what I'm gonna do with her.

53
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:52,649
So your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment. The world does not stop.

54
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,402
Is anybody else scared?

55
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,907
If Joey loses this audition,
then that is it for Estelle. I don't care.

56
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,578
Annie, you are a doll.
What time can you see him?

57
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,872
I need a pen. Pen.

58
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,590
Get the woman a pad.
Get the woman a pad. A pad! A pad!

59
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,426
Oh, now you want a pad.

60
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,055
-Hey.
-Hello.

61
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,224
Where's my boy?

62
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,518
Here's my boy.

63
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,481
And here's his Barbie.

64
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,780
What's, uh~?
What's my boy doing with a Barbie?

65
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,533
He picked it out at the toy store himself.
He loves it.

66
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,369
He carries it everywhere,
like a security blanket.

67
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,581
But with ski boots and a kicky beret.

68
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,209
Yeah, it's cute.

69
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,378
Why does he have it again?

70
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,548
So he's got a doll. So what?

71
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,928
Unless you're afraid
he's gonna grow up to be...

72
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,721
...in show business.

73
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,059
This wouldn't have to do with the fact
that he's being raised by two women?

74
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:16,066
You know what? It's fine. If you're
okay with the Barbie thing, so am I.

75
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,528
Give Daddy the Barbie.
Give me the Barbie. Okay, how about-?

76
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,072
Don't you wanna play
with a monster truck?

77
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,408
No? Okay.

78
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,328
Ooh, ooh. How about a Dino-Soldier?

79
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,502
You are so pathetic.

80
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,130
Why can't your son
just play with his doll?

81
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,097
I gotta go to work.

82
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,475
Has anybody seen my left boob?

83
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,104
I loved that movie.

84
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,277
Here it is. Joey, what are you doing?

85
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,154
I'm sorry. It just felt nice.

86
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,535
Joe. Joe. Answer the phone.

87
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,289
I only got one arm. You should do stuff
for me. Get me a sweater.

88
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,458
Just do it. It's Janice.

89
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,627
And if I get it,
I'm gonna have to see her tonight.

90
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,674
Oh, that's great.
I'm gonna have to see her tonight.

91
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,135
Why don't you wanna see Janice?

92
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,554
Last night at dinner,
when the meals came...

93
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:32,475
...she put half her chicken piccata
on my plate and took all my tomatoes.

94
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,521
And that's bad...

95
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,982
...because you hate chicken piccata?

96
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,817
No.

97
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:45,363
You didn't wanna share your tomatoes.
Tomatoes are very important to you.

98
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,490
All of a sudden, we were this couple.

99
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,327
And this alarm started going off
in my head.

100
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,662
"Run for your life!
Get out of the building!"

101
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,916
Ugh. Men are unbelievable.

102
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,709
What is it with you people?

103
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,920
The minute you feel something,
you have to run away?

104
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,340
I know. That-

105
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:09,137
That's why I don't wanna go tonight.
I'm afraid I'm gonna say something stupid.

106
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,182
Oh. You mean that guy thing
where you act mean and distant...

107
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,559
-...until you get us to break up with you?
-Mm-hm.

108
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:15,936
Hey, you know about that?

109
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,522
What do I do? I wanna get past this.

110
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,025
I don't wanna be afraid
of the commitment thing.

111
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,695
I wanna go through the tunnel
to the other side.

112
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,950
-Where there's no fear of commitment.
-Ah.

113
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,077
Do we have any--?

114
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,916
Do we have any thoughts here?

115
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,502
I've never been through
the tunnel myself because...

116
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,338
...you're not allowed through
with more than one girl in the car.

117
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,631
Hmm.

118
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,179
But it seems to me it's pretty much
like anything else. Face your fear.

119
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,391
You have a fear of heights?
Go to the top of the building.

120
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,559
You're afraid of bugs.

121
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,436
Get a bug.

122
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,064
Right?

123
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,982
You have a fear of commitment.

124
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:07,696
So I say you go in there and you be
the most committed guy there ever was.

125
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,115
Amazingly, that makes sense.

126
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,077
-Do you think?
-Oh, yeah. Go for it, man.

127
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,412
Jump off the high dive.

128
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,249
Stare down the barrel of the gun.
Pee into the wind.

129
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,461
Joe, if I'm staring down
the barrel of a gun...

130
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,715
...I'm gonna be pretty much peeing
every which way.

131
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,596
Ooh, it's your audition
from this morning.

132
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,806
-Ooh.
-Oh.

133
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,015
Can I use the phone?

134
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,811
Sure, that's what it's there for.
Emergencies and, uh, pretend agents.

135
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,815
Come on, baby. Come on.

136
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,445
Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page.

137
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,198
Okay, well, she's in her car.
I'll have to patch you through.

138
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,033
Very nice touch.

139
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,661
Okay, go ahead.

140
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,373
-Talk, talk, talk.
-Oh, oh. Um- Ahem.

141
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,333
Hi, Annie?

142
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,835
Fantastic.

143
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,337
-You got it.
-Oh! You got it.

144
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,299
Um, will he work for scale, you ask me?

145
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,675
Well, I don't know about that.

146
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,470
-Ahem.
-Except that I do and he will.

147
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,556
Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.

148
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,142
I would love to have lunch with you.

149
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,145
How about we have lunch next-?

150
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,397
Oop, went through a tunnel. Ha, ha.

151
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,690
Unbelievable.

152
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,901
-Oh, thank you so much.
-Ha, ha.

153
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:32,697
It was really fun. I mean,
I've never talked on a car phone before.

154
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,117
Oh. You are so amazing.
Could you do me this huge favor?

155
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,788
There's this one other audition I want,
and Estelle couldn't get me in.

156
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,499
Uh, I don't know.
It was fun one time, but-

157
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,168
Come on, please?
It would just be this one more.

158
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,836
Well, actually it's two.

159
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,171
-Two?
-Yeah.

160
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,881
Well, really it's three.

161
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,094
Please? You're so good at it. I love you.

162
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,763
Okay. But just these three, right?

163
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,223
No, it's four.

164
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,854
So how come you wanted
to eat in tonight?

165
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,732
Because I wanted...

166
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,526
...to give you this.

167
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:14,447
Oh. Are you a puppy!

168
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,577
Contact paper.

169
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,040
You never know what to say
when someone you're sleeping with...

170
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,959
...gives you contact paper. Ha, ha.

171
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,922
Wait, there's more.
See, the contact paper is to go...

172
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,967
...in your brand-new drawer.

173
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,388
See, the drawer actually goes
in my dresser.

174
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:42,100
Oh. You didn't have to do this.

175
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,768
Yes, I did.

176
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,479
Yes, I did. Because you're my girlfriend...

177
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,066
...and that's what girlfriends should get.

178
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,070
Oh. Well, I gotta buy a vowel...

179
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,450
...because, oh, my God. Mwah.

180
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,786
Who would've thought that someday...

181
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,081
...Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer?

182
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,459
Well, not me.

183
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,464
But that's what's happened.
And, uh, there's more.

184
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,426
We should take a trip.

185
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,094
We should?

186
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,097
Yup. We're a couple,
and that's what couples do.

187
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,808
And I wanna meet your parents.

188
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,811
We should take a trip with your parents.

189
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,321
I don't think we need to,
because you're tripping me out right now.

190
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,740
-Are you okay?
-No, I am.

191
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,326
Ha, ha. I actually am. This is amazing.

192
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,787
My entire life, I have feared this place.

193
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,749
And now that I'm here, it's like,
what was the big deal?

194
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,794
I could probably say,
"Let's move in together," and I'd be okay.

195
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,631
You probably want us
to move in together?

196
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:59,052
-It doesn't scare me.
-Yeah, well it scares me.

197
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,139
I'm not even divorced yet.
You just invited me over here for pasta...

198
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,309
...and all of a sudden
you're talking about moving in together.

199
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,561
And I wasn't even that hungry.

200
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,690
You know what? It's getting really late,
and I should just, urn-

201
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,860
Don't go. I've scared you.
I've said too much.

202
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,072
I'm hopeless and awkward
and desperate for love.

203
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,997
Hey, Janice, it's me.

204
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,332
Uh, ahem.

205
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:33,419
I wanted to apologize in advance
for having chased you down the street.

206
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,380
Bye-bye.

207
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,637
Here you go, honey. This will help.

208
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,473
So I catch up to her and she says...

209
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,101
...this relationship's going too fast
and we have to slow down.

210
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,020
-Ugh.
-Ugh. That is never good.

211
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,981
Then I got all...

212
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,692
...needy and clingy.

213
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,612
Now, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad.
How did you leave it?

214
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,822
She said she'd call me.

215
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,243
Oh, God.

216
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,746
Ugh. Welcome to our side of the tunnel.

217
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,833
This ice cream tastes like crap,
by the way.

218
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,628
Yeah, well,
it's that low-cal, nondairy, soy-milk junk.

219
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,756
We save the real stuff
for the truly terminal cases.

220
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,177
When you start getting screwed over
all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.

221
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,263
Yeah, you do.

222
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,682
So you don't think I'm terminal?

223
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:32,103
Oh, no, not at all. You're not terminal.
We just need some damage control.

224
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,147
Okay. Okay. So should I call her?

225
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,065
No.

226
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,737
It's a critical time. If you feel yourself
reaching for that phone...

227
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,406
...you go shopping,
you get your butt in a bubble bath.

228
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,160
If you want her back,
you have got to start acting aloof.

229
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,412
She has to know you're not needy.

230
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,372
So, what you have to do is...

231
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,500
...you have to accidentally run into her
on purpose...

232
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,502
...and then act aloof.

233
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,757
So I'm not gonna lose her?

234
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,509
Oh, honey, you're not a total loser.

235
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,265
I said, so I'm not gonna lose her?

236
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,060
Oh.

237
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,191
Guess who's here.

238
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,402
It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben.

239
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,656
<i>Real American hero I'm G.I. Joe</i>

240
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,326
Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.

241
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,121
G.I. Joe?
You really think he's gonna fall for that?

242
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,751
G.I. Joe? Cool. Can I play?

243
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,256
Look, Ben. It's a toy that protects
U.S. oil interests overseas.

244
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,509
Go, Joe!

245
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,969
Hello. Oh.

246
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,388
-Phoebe, there you are.
-No, it's not. Sorry.

247
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,308
But, Phoebe, wait, wait. Phoebe. Phoebe.

248
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,603
Oh, Joey. Oh, okay.
See, I didn't recognize you...

249
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,355
...in those pants.

250
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,651
That TV movie I went in for,
did you hear anything?

251
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,611
I think I got a shot at it.

252
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,530
Yes, they called. You didn't get it.

253
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,618
Okay? I mean, you didn't get it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

254
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,287
That's okay. These things happen.

255
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,290
But they shouldn't happen.
You know what?

256
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,626
You're in a terrible, terrible business.

257
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,423
I don't wanna be the person
who makes your face look like that. Ugh.

258
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,425
I'm okay. See?

259
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,846
Now you're sad and creepy.

260
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,640
You know what? I'm sorry. I quit, okay?

261
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:36,477
No, no, no, you can't quit.
You're the best agent I ever had.

262
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:40,189
Look, rejection is part of being an actor.
You can't take it personal.

263
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,027
Not personal? They said they'd never met
an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.

264
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,155
They actually said that?

265
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:51,325
Yeah. Oh, God, there's that face again.
See? I can't do this job.

266
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,744
No, this is why you have to do this job.

267
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,121
Agents always lie.

268
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,291
Estelle just says stuff like,
"They went another way."

269
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,334
But this? I can use this.

270
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,379
I can work on a new accent.

271
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,508
Yeah, okay. No.
If it helps you, okay. Yeah.

272
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:11,137
You'll never get me, Joe!

273
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,027
No, thank you.

274
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,822
Chandler.

275
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,325
Hello, Janice.

276
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,871
What are you doing here?

277
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,831
Uh, just a bit of shopping.

278
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,875
How have you been?

279
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,420
Are you being British?

280
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,088
No.

281
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,257
Not anymore.

282
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,053
Why are you shopping here?
You don't live in this neighborhood.

283
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,263
Were you here waiting for me?

284
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,183
Yuh-huh.

285
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,061
I'm just, uh, you know...

286
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,688
...picking up some things for a party.

287
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,400
Barley?

288
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,694
What kind of a party serves barley?

289
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,989
Well, I'm sorry if my friends
aren't as sophisticated as yours.

290
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,952
-Where is this party?
-Here in Chelsea.

291
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,912
Whose party is it?

292
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,456
-A woman's.
-What woman?

293
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,709
Chelsea.

294
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,422
Either you're seeing somebody
behind my back...

295
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,259
...which would make you
the biggest jerk on the planet...

296
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,678
...or you're pretending
you're seeing somebody...

297
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,515
...which just makes you so pathetic
I could just start crying right here.

298
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:41,269
So which of these two guys
do you wanna be?

299
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,480
Can I be that guy?

300
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,903
Okay, we got some more good rejections.
Lots of stuff to work on.

301
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,239
Oh. Okay. Shoot.

302
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,117
Okay. Urn.... Oh, the zoo commercial.

303
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,535
-I didn't get it?
-No.

304
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:01,664
They said that you
"weren't believable as a human being."

305
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,585
So you can work on that.

306
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,545
Great. What else?

307
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,674
Um, the off-Broadway-play people said
that you were "pretty but dumb."

308
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,176
-Oh.
-No, wait, I'm sorry. That's "pretty dumb."

309
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,014
Oh. Look, it's okay, no, no, no. Really.

310
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,515
Look, urn...

311
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,310
...I really appreciate this, Pheebs...

312
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,895
...but I'm gonna have to go back
to Estelle.

313
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,105
Oh.

314
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,691
Don't get me wrong.
You're a better agent than she is...

315
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,737
...but at least with her, I don't wanna
blow my pretty dumb brains out.

316
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,948
Yeah, no, I understand.

317
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,825
-You do? Thanks. Okay.
-Yeah.

318
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,619
Sorry.

319
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,040
-Wait a minute.
-What?

320
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,458
Wait a minute.

321
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,086
Did you just make all that stuff up
to get out of being my agent?

322
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,631
Oh, he caught me.

323
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,216
I am so busted.

324
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,596
That's what I suspected.

325
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,060
And then I just, you know...

326
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,230
...threw the bag of barley at her
and ran out of the store.

327
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,735
My God, Chandler, we said be aloof,
not a doof.

328
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,239
I've actually ruined this, haven't I?

329
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,326
It's time
for the good ice cream now, right?

330
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,828
-Yeah, it is.
-Okay.

331
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,207
You know what?
Everything's gonna be okay.

332
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,461
Hello?

333
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,047
Hi, Janice.

334
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,924
Can you hold on for a second?

335
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,759
Okay. Okay.

336
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,052
What do I do?

337
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,179
I don't know. This is unprecedented.

338
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,057
If we ever did what you did,
a man would never call.

339
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,266
Hello?

340
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,436
I got it. Pretend you just woke up.
That'll throw her off.

341
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,772
-Be sleepy.
-Yes. And grumpy.

342
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,650
What are you-? Stop naming dwarves.

343
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,780
Hello, Janice. Hi.

344
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,574
I'm so glad that you called.

345
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:06,205
I know I've been acting
really weird lately...

346
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,584
...and it's just because
I'm crazy about you...

347
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:17,425
...and I just got stupid and scared...

348
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,552
...and stupid a couple more times.

349
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:21,887
And I'm sorry.

350
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,932
Really?

351
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,436
Ha, ha. Really?

352
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,938
He's so lucky. If Janice were a guy...

353
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,941
...she'd be sleeping
with somebody else by now.

354
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,527
I love you too.

355
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,404
Ugh. It's so unfair.

356
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,789
G.I. Joe? G.I. Joe?

357
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,793
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys.
That's the doll he chose.

358
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,504
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?

359
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,132
Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.

360
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,719
And if you guys can't deal with it,
that's just your too bad.

361
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,641
What are you being such a weenie for?
So he has a Barbie. Big deal.

362
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,935
You used to dress up like a woman.

363
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,777
What?

364
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,279
The way you used to dress up
in Mom's clothes?

365
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,364
What are you talking about?

366
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,534
The big hat, the pearls,
the little pink handbag?

367
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,370
Okay. You are totally making this up.

368
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,873
How can you not remember?

369
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,750
You made us call you "Bea"?

370
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,175
Oh, God.

371
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,262
I've literally never been this happy.

372
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,556
Wasn't there a little song?

373
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,184
Oh, please, God, let there be a song.

374
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,561
There was no song. There was no song.

375
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,146
<i>I am Bea</i>

376
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,398
<i>-I drink tea-
</i>-That's enough.

377
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,983
<i>Won't you...?</i>

378
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,193
Oh.

379
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,778
<i>Won't you...?</i>

380
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,780
<i>Won't you...?</i>

381
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,867
-Won't you dance around with me?
-Ha-ha-ha.

382
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,001
<i>I am Bea</i>

383
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,879
<i>I drink tea</i>

384
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:23,634
<i>Won't you dance around with-?</i>

385
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,604
Ross!
