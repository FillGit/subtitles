1
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:05,339
-Hmm. Oh, I don't know.
-What?

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,925
Well, as old as he is in dog years...

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,678
...do you think Snoopy
should still be allowed to fly this thing?

4
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,014
-Rachel?
-Yeah?

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:18,185
Remember when you came, you spent two
weeks getting trained by another waitress?

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,104
Oh, sure.
Do you need me to train somebody new?

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,565
Ha-ha-ha. Good one.

8
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,695
Actually, uh,
Terry wants you to take the training again.

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,905
Whenever.

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,327
Do you believe that?

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,917
Yeah.

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,139
So that's two boxes
of the Holiday Macaroons.

13
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,892
On behalf of the Brown Birds of America,
I salute you.

14
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,440
Just admit it. You have no backhand.

15
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,735
Excuse me, little one.
I have a very solid backhand.

16
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,155
Shielding your face
and shrieking like a girl...

17
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,365
...is not a backhand.

18
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,368
I was shrieking...

19
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,661
...like a Marine.

20
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:06,335
All right, here, watch me execute
the three P's of championship play.

21
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,253
Power, huah...

22
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,838
...precision, shew...

23
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,131
...and panache.

24
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,721
You broke a little girl's leg?

25
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,640
I know. I feel horrible, okay?

26
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,978
It says here that a Muppet got whacked
on Sesame Street last night.

27
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,732
Where exactly were you around 10-ish?

28
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,445
Well, I'm gonna go see her.
I wanna bring her something.

29
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,281
-What do you think she'd like?
-Maybe a Hello Kitty doll?

30
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,575
The ability to walk?

31
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,373
I'm gonna get back to retraining. Ahem.

32
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,583
All right. See you guys.

33
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,585
Look out, kids. He's coming.

34
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,965
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.

35
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,551
Have fun. Oh, wait. No, don't.

36
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,013
I forgot. I am totally against that now.

37
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,600
What? Me having a job?

38
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:08,438
No, no. I am against innocent trees
being cut down in their prime...

39
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,441
...and their corpses
grotesquely dressed...

40
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,653
...in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.

41
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,822
Hey, how do you sleep at night?

42
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,575
Well, I'm pretty tired
from lugging the trees around.

43
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,370
Hey, Phoebe, listen.

44
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,372
You got this all wrong.

45
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,582
Those trees were born
to be Christmas trees.

46
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,962
They're fulfilling their life purpose
by making people happy.

47
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,296
Really?

48
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,217
Yes.

49
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,928
Yes, and, uh, the trees are happy too...

50
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:44,224
...because for most of them,
it's their only chance to see New York.

51
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,647
After you've delivered the drinks,
you take the tray-

52
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,317
Gunther, Gunther, please.
I have worked here for two and a half years.

53
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,195
I know the empty trays go over there.

54
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,282
What if you put them here?

55
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,741
Huh.

56
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,745
You know, that's actually a good idea.
They'll be closer to the mugs.

57
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,624
You know what? You should have
the other waitresses do that too.

58
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,294
-They already do.
-Huh?

59
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,796
That's why they call it "the tray spot."

60
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,967
I always heard them talk about that.
I just thought it was a club they went to.

61
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,927
Oh, God.

62
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,515
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

63
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,310
Sweetheart.

64
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,649
So this must be kind of neat
for you, huh?

65
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,402
Your dad tells me
you get a couple of days off school...

66
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,739
...and you don't have to sell
those cookies anymore.

67
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,534
Well, I kind of wanted to sell the cookies.

68
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,454
The girl who sells the most
wins a trip to Space Camp...

69
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,790
...and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.

70
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,628
Wow, you really like
all this space stuff, huh?

71
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,340
Yeah. My dad says if I'd spend as
much time helping him clean apartments...

72
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,009
...as I do daydreaming
about outer space...

73
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,929
...he'd be able to afford a trip
to the Taj Mahal.

74
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:08,350
I think you'd have to clean a whole lot
of apartments to go all the way to India.

75
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,686
No, the one in Atlantic City.
Dad loves the slots.

76
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,234
He says he's gonna double
the college money my grandma left me.

77
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,778
Huh.

78
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,239
Well, good luck to Dad.

79
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:28,912
Say, how many more boxes
would you have to sell in order to win?

80
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,416
-The girl who won last year sold 475.
-Yeah?

81
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,461
So far, I've sold 75.

82
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,299
Four hundred, huh?

83
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,178
Well, that sounds doable.
How much are the boxes?

84
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,513
Five dollars a box.

85
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,432
And what is second prize?

86
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,560
A 10-speed bike.

87
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,312
But I'd rather have something
my dad couldn't sell.

88
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,525
Well, that makes sense.

89
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,570
Could you do me one favor?
If it's not too much trouble.

90
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,198
-Yeah, Sarah, anything.
-Could you pull the curtains open for me?

91
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,285
The astronauts from the space shuttle
are gonna be on the news.

92
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,954
Since we don't have a TV,
the lady across the alley...

93
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,457
...said she'd push hers up to her window
so I can watch it.

94
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,263
Yes?

95
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,057
Yeah, hi. I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.

96
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:36,229
You're no Brown Bird.
I can see you through my peephole.

97
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,859
Um, no, hi. I'm an honorary Brown Bird.

98
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,989
What does that mean?

99
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,118
Uh, well, it means that I can sell cookies,
but I'm not invited to sleepovers.

100
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,751
I can dial 911 at the press of a button,
you know.

101
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,252
Now, go away.

102
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,213
Please, please. It's for a poor little girl...

103
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,967
...who wants to go to Space Camp
more than anything in the world.

104
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,552
-I'm pressing.
-No-

105
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,763
A policeman is on his way.

106
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,974
Okay, okay. I'm going, I'm going.

107
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,191
-I can still see you.
-All right.

108
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,487
Hey.

109
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,989
Hey. What are you doing here?

110
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,200
Well, I thought a lot
about what you said...

111
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:34,579
...and I realized, all right,
maybe I was a little judgmental.

112
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,873
Yeah. Oh, but, oh. Ugh.

113
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,501
Now, now, Phoebe, remember, hey...

114
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,962
...they're just fulfilling their Christmas-

115
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,588
-Destiny. Yes.
-Sure.

116
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,466
-Right.
-Okay.

117
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,970
Yikes. That one doesn't look
very fulfilled.

118
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,390
Oh, that's one of the old ones.
He's just taking it to the back.

119
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,934
You keep the old ones in the back?

120
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,395
That is so ageist.

121
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:03,817
-We have to make room for the fresh ones.
-So, what happens to the old guys?

122
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,860
Well, they go into the chipper.

123
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,323
Why do I have a feeling
that's not as happy as it sounds?

124
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,869
No. No!

125
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,420
Hey, hey, hey.

126
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,135
And these come in the shapes
of Christmas characters.

127
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,971
Santa, Rudolph and Baby Jesus.

128
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,639
Oh.

129
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,517
All right.
I'll take a box of the cream-filled Jesuses.

130
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,564
Wait a minute, one box? I'm trying to send
a poor little girl to Space Camp.

131
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,692
I'm putting you down for five boxes.
Chandler, what about you?

132
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:50,196
All right, do you have any, uh,
coconut-flavored deities?

133
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,534
No, but there's coconut
in the Hanukkah Menorah-eos.

134
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,163
I'll put you down for eight boxes,
one for each night.

135
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,372
<i>Okay.</i>

136
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,500
-Mon?
-I'll take one box of the Mint Treasures.

137
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,794
One, and that's it.

138
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,547
I started gaining weight
after I joined the Brown Birds.

139
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,593
Remember Dad bought every one
of my boxes and I ate them all?

140
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,555
No, Mon, Dad had to buy every one
of your boxes...

141
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,682
...because you ate them all.

142
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:24,856
But, you know,
I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time.

143
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,650
Why don't I just put you down
for three Mint Treasures...

144
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,611
...and just a couple of the Rudolphs?

145
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,279
No.

146
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,451
Oh, come on, now.
You know you want them.

147
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,037
Don't do this.

148
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:43,708
I'll tell you what, Mon.
I'll give you the first box for free.

149
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,669
Oh, God, I gotta go.

150
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,964
Come on.
All the cool kids are eating them.

151
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,345
And later I wanna show you
why we don't just trap spiders...

152
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,306
...under coffee mugs
and leave them there.

153
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,022
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate.
My life officially sucks.

154
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:10,068
But wasn't this supposed to be temporary?
I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff.

155
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,570
Well, yeah, I'm still pursuing that.

156
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,740
How, exactly, are you pursuing that?

157
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,828
You know, other than sending out resumes,
like, what, two years ago?

158
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,706
Well, I'm also sending out...

159
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,376
...good thoughts.

160
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,921
If you ask me,
as long as you got this job...

161
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,799
...you got nothing pushing you
to get another one.

162
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,218
You need The Fear.

163
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,053
-The Fear?
-He's right.

164
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,472
If you quit this job,
you then have motivation...

165
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,975
...to go after a job you really want.

166
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:46,855
How come you're still at a job you hate?
Why don't you quit and get The Fear?

167
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,400
Because I'm too afraid.

168
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,902
God. I don't know.

169
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,323
I mean, I would give anything to work
for a designer, you know, or a buyer.

170
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,660
Ugh. I just don't wanna be 30
and still work here.

171
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:05,707
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28
and still working here.

172
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,792
-Rachel?
-Yeah?

173
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,171
Remind me to review with you
which pot is decaf and which is regular.

174
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,092
Can't I just look at the handles on them?

175
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,011
You would think.

176
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,807
Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what?
I am a terrible waitress.

177
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,895
Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?
Because I don't care.

178
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,648
I don't care. I don't care which pot
is regular and which pot is decaf.

179
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,650
I don't care where the tray spot is.

180
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,070
I just don't care.
This is not what I wanna do.

181
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,158
So I don't think I should do it anymore.

182
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,953
-I'm gonna give you my week's notice.
-What?

183
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,330
Gunther, I quit.

184
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,044
Does this mean we're gonna have to start
paying for coffee?

185
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,800
Okay, 12.

186
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,844
Twenty-two.

187
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,013
Eighteen.

188
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,103
-What?
-I spelled out "boobies." Ha, ha.

189
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,528
Ross, put me down for another box
of the Mint Treasures, okay?

190
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,073
Where are the Mint Treasures?

191
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,034
Uh, we're out. I sold them all.

192
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,078
What?

193
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,664
Monica, I'm cutting you off.

194
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,961
No. No.

195
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,213
Just a couple more boxes.

196
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,592
It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.

197
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,138
You gotta help me out
with a couple more boxes.

198
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,725
Mon, look at yourself.
You have cookie on your neck.

199
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,227
Oh, God.

200
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:55,400
-Whoa. So how many you sold so far?
-Ah? Check this out.

201
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,821
-Five hundred and seventeen boxes.
-Oh, my God. How did you do that?

202
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,282
Ahem. Okay, the other night,
I was leaving the museum...

203
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,869
...just as <i>Laser Floyd </i>was letting out
of the planetarium.

204
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,789
Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes.

205
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,626
That's when it occurred to me.
The key to my success: the munchies.

206
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:20,008
So I started hitting the NYU dorms
around midnight.

207
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,138
I am selling cookies by the case.

208
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,389
They call me...

209
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,975
..."Cookie Dude."

210
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:34,689
Okay, stop what you're doing.
I need envelope stuffers, stamp lickers....

211
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,066
Oh, hey. Who did these resumes for you?

212
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,651
Me, on my computer.

213
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,778
Well, you sure used a large font.

214
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,531
Uh, yeah.
Well, "Waitress at a Coffeehouse"...

215
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:47,327
...and "Cheer Squad Co-captain"
only took up so much room.

216
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,413
Heh, hen. Hey, that's funny.

217
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,249
You're funny, Chandler.
You're a funny guy.

218
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,293
You know what else is really funny?

219
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,504
Something else I might have said?

220
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,548
I don't know, I don't know.

221
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,009
Weren't you the guy
that told me to quit my job...

222
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,261
...when I had absolutely
nothing else to do?

223
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,430
Ha-ha-ha. Huh? Huh?

224
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,351
Sweetie, calm down. It's gonna be okay.

225
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,102
No, it's not gonna be okay, Ross.

226
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,190
Tomorrow is my last day,
and I don't have a lead.

227
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,692
Okay, you know what?
I'm just gonna call Gunther...

228
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,861
...and I'm gonna tell him I'm not quitting.

229
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,447
You don't wanna give in to The Fear.

230
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:28,034
You and your stupid Fear.
I hate your Fear.

231
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,661
I would like to take you and your Fear-

232
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,164
Hey. I got great news.

233
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,917
Run, Joey. Run for your life.

234
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,422
What? Rach, listen, have you ever heard
of Fortunata Fashions?

235
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,217
-No.
-My old man's doing a plumbing job there...

236
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,094
...and he heard they have an opening.

237
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,388
Want me to see
if he can get you an interview?

238
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,433
Oh, my God, yes. I would love that.
Oh, that's so sweet, Joey.

239
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,437
Not a problem.
And now for the great news.

240
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,358
-What, that wasn't the great news?
-Only if you think it's better than this.

241
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,486
Snow-in-a-Can.

242
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,656
I got it at work.
You want me to decorate the window?

243
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,868
-Give it kind of a Christmas looky?
-Christmas cookie?

244
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,501
Okay, and this one here's a Douglas fir.

245
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,296
Now, it's a little more money,
but you get a nicer smell.

246
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,966
Looks good. I'll take it.

247
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,635
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
You don't want that one. Uh-uh.

248
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:32,223
No. You can have
this cool brown one. Ooh.

249
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,725
It's almost dead.

250
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,688
But that's why you have to buy it,
so that it can fulfill its Christmas destiny.

251
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,607
Otherwise, they're gonna throw it
into the chipper. Tell him, Joey.

252
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,109
Uh....

253
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:47,029
Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill
their Christmas destiny, heh...

254
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,490
...are thrown in the chipper.

255
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,619
I think I'm gonna look around
a little bit more.

256
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,416
Pheebs. Heh. You gotta stop doing this.
I'm working on commission here.

257
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,336
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick
out my Christmas tree.

258
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,965
Well, look no further. This one's yours.

259
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,009
Ah.

260
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,470
Is this the one that I threw out last year?

261
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,641
All right, you know what? Never mind.
Everybody wants to have a green one.

262
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,604
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get so emotional.

263
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,107
I guess it's just....
The holidays are just hard.

264
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:27,028
Oh, honey, is that because
your mom died around Christmas?

265
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,530
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.

266
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,866
Oh.

267
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,084
Hi there. How many did you sell?

268
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,839
I'm not gonna tell you.
You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.

269
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,801
Hey, now. That was an accident, okay?

270
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,178
You're a big scrud.

271
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,890
What's a scrud?

272
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,142
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud?

273
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,439
I don't have to. I can just look at you.

274
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,275
All right, girls...

275
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,612
...and man.

276
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,156
Let's see your final tallies.

277
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,117
Oh.... Debbie.

278
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,330
Three hundred and twenty-one boxes
of cookies. Very nice.

279
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,124
Not nice enough.

280
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,918
Charla.

281
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,128
Two hundred and seventy-eight.

282
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,214
Sorry, dear, but still good.

283
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,967
Good for a scrud.

284
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,386
Let's see.

285
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,263
Ooh. Yes, Elizabeth.

286
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,808
Eight hundred and seventy-one.

287
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,935
That's crap.

288
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,399
Sister Brown Bird.

289
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,734
Good going.

290
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,197
Who's next?

291
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,787
-Hi there.
-Hi.

292
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,374
And batting for Sarah...

293
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,876
...Ross Geller.

294
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,130
Eight hundred and seventy-two.

295
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:14,760
Although it looks like you bought
an awful lot of cookies yourself.

296
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:21,183
Ahem. That is because my doctor
says that I have a very serious...

297
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,686
...nougat...

298
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,398
...deficiency.

299
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,569
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.

300
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,071
Well, I lost.

301
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,199
Some little girl loaned her uniform
to her 19-year-old sister...

302
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:42,246
...who went down to the <i>USS Nimitz
</i>and sold over 2000 boxes.

303
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,418
-Hey. How'd the interview go?
-Oh, I blew it.

304
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,712
-I wouldn't have even hired me.
-Oh.

305
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,756
-Ugh.
-Come here, sweetie.

306
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:58,512
Listen, you're gonna go on like
a thousand interviews before you get a job.

307
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,436
That's not how that was supposed
to come out.

308
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,064
This is just the worst Christmas ever.

309
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,400
Rach, maybe you should just, you know,
stay here at the coffeehouse.

310
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,655
I can't. It's too late.
Terry already hired that girl over there.

311
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:20,368
Look at her.
She's even got waitress experience. Ugh.

312
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,495
Last night she was...

313
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:27,792
...teaching everybody
how to make napkins into...

314
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,335
...swans.

315
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,755
That word was "swans."

316
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,715
<i>"Swans."</i>

317
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:42,473
Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet himself
really perked up my Christmas.

318
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,233
Ah! Oh, my God.

319
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,360
Merry Christmas!

320
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,197
You saved them. You guys.

321
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,366
Oh, God, you're the best.

322
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,119
Looks like <i>Night of the Living Dead
Christmas Trees.</i>

323
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,374
Hello?

324
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,376
Yeah, this is she.

325
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,588
Oh! You're kidding. You're kidding.

326
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,216
Oh, thank you. I love you.

327
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,677
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.

328
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,512
I got the job.

329
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,848
-Oh, hey. All right!
-That's great.

330
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,435
Oh! God bless us, every one.

331
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:33,149
Here we go.
I'm serving my last cup of coffee.

332
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,285
There you go. Enjoy.

333
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,036
Yay!

334
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,914
-Should I tell her I ordered tea?
-No.

335
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,083
-No.
-No.

336
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,460
Um, excuse me, everyone?

337
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,046
Uh, this is my last night working here...

338
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:01,635
...and I just wanted to say
that I made some really good friends here.

339
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,472
And it's just time to move on.

340
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,437
And no offense to everybody
who still works here...

341
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,065
...but you have no idea
how good it feels to say...

342
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,777
...that as of this moment...

343
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,823
...I will never have to make coffee again.

344
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,826
Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr.
likes his coffee strong.

345
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,413
So you're gonna use two bags
instead of one, see?

346
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,374
Now, pay attention
because this part's tricky.

347
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,961
See, some people use filters just once.

348
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,348
I'm sorry you didn't get to go
to Space Camp...

349
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:53,103
...and I'm hoping that maybe somehow,
this may help make up for it. Okay?

350
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,730
Presenting...

351
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,984
...Sarah Tuddle's Private,
Very Special Space Camp!

352
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,324
Really, Mr. Geller,
you don't have to do this.

353
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,617
Oh, come on. Here we go.

354
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,122
Stand by for mission countdown.

355
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,707
Ten, ten, ten.

356
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,125
Nine, nine, nine.

357
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,461
Eight, eight, eight. Ow.

358
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,547
Okay, blast off.

359
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,767
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.

360
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,937
Oh, no, an asteroid!
