1
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,797
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,717
<i>"Say, Rachel...</i>

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,720
<i>.../ was wondering if you'd like to go
to a movie with me sometime...</i>

4
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,513
<i>...as my lover."</i>

5
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,143
<i>Mm. Too out there.</i>

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,104
<i>"Maybe you'd just like to get
something to eat with me sometime...</i>

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,482
<i>...as my lover."</i>

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,611
-Hi.
-Hi.

9
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,530
All right, let's go shopping.

10
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,407
You know, before we go, uh,
there's something I need to say.

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,910
-Oh. Okay.
-Okay.

12
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,624
I've kind of had this, uh-
This crush on you.

13
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,670
But since you were with Ross,
I didn't do anything about it.

14
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,799
Now that you're not, I'd really
like to ask you out sometime.

15
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,345
So that's what I'm doing now.

16
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:57,933
Wow. Urn....

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,362
I dropped a cup.

18
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,915
So that's why within a few years,
that voice recognition...

19
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,251
...is gonna be pretty much standard
on any computer.

20
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:11,131
You know, so you could be, like,
"Wash my car. Clean my room."

21
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,383
It's not gonna be able to do
any of those things...

22
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,469
...but it'll understand
what you're saying.

23
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:20,057
-Oh, this was so great.
-Yeah, it was.

24
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,809
All right, then.

25
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,395
Bye.

26
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,695
Hello, people who do not live here.

27
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,947
-Hi.
-Hello.

28
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,327
I gave you a key for emergencies.

29
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,579
We were out of Doritos.

30
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,958
Hey, how'd the date go
with Mr. Millionaire?

31
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,212
"Mr. Millionaire.
New, from Snooty Playthings.

32
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,131
Third wife sold separately."

33
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,843
He's great. I mean,
we have such a good time together.

34
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,099
He's so funny and so sweet.
And I'm not attracted to him at all.

35
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,309
-Still?
-No.

36
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:08,271
It's driving me crazy. I mean, in every
other way, he's like the perfect guy.

37
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,359
He has everything.
Plus, he actually has everything.

38
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:16,279
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers
from Sharper Image?

39
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,823
Two.

40
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,575
Wow. Can Joey and I
put them on and fight?

41
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:27,290
<i>Oh, Mommy. Oh, Daddy.
I am a big old baddy.</i>

42
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,795
<i>Oh, Mommy. Oh, Daddy.
I am a big old baddy.</i>

43
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,093
I guess he must've gotten the part
in that play.

44
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,221
-Oh.
-Either that or Gloria Estefan was right.

45
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,807
Eventually, the rhythm
is going to get you.

46
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,274
-Joe, how's it going?
-Good.

47
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,613
-Hey.
-Hi.

48
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,074
Ah, so you're playing Adrianne, huh?

49
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,785
Yes. Are you one
of the retarded cousins?

50
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,666
No, no. Uh, I'm playing your husband,
Victor. I'm Joey Tribbiani.

51
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,043
Hi. Nice to meet you. Kate Miller.

52
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,595
Heh. So the, uh, play's pretty great, huh?

53
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,347
Oh, yeah.
I love Jennifer Banberry's work.

54
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,766
She's so brilliantly incisive...

55
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,643
...when it comes to deconstructing
the psyche of the middle class.

56
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,855
Oh, forget about it. She rocks. Ha, ha.

57
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,862
Where do I know you from?

58
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,532
Dr. Drake Ramoray?

59
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,160
<i>Days of our Lives?</i>

60
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,079
Voted most datable neurosurgeon
by <i>Teen Beat?</i>

61
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,291
No, that's not it.

62
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,835
So you're a soap actor.

63
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,297
Well, this must be exciting for you,
being in a real play. Hmm?

64
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,300
Hey, I've done plays before.
I'm a serious actor.

65
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,844
That infomercial.

66
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,015
For the milk-carton-spout thing.

67
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,935
You're the guy who doesn't
know how to pour milk.

68
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,898
See, I actually can pour milk.
But I got you believing that I couldn't.

69
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,567
Ha, ha. Now, see, that's acting.

70
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,071
Right. At the end, you choked
on a cookie.

71
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,948
Yeah, that was real.

72
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,994
-Wow. I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
-I know.

73
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,955
Well, So, what are you gonna tell him?

74
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,167
Well, I told him I would think about it,
but I'm gonna tell him no.

75
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,627
Huh.

76
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,422
I mean, I think I'd say no
to anybody right now.

77
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,679
Oh, but it was so strange.
I mean, I'm standing there...

78
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:50,100
...with this charming, cute guy
who's asking me to go out with him...

79
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,018
...which I'm allowed to do...

80
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,481
...and I felt guilty, you know,
like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.

81
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,193
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means...

82
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:04,322
...that you're not over Ross yet
and you have issues with your father.

83
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,122
-I don't have any issues with my father.
-Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing.

84
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,418
I hate this woman. I hate her.

85
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,212
She told everyone in the company
about that infomercial...

86
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,465
...and now they all keep asking me
to open their drinks.

87
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:27,012
Okay? And whenever I can't do it,
they're all, like, laughing at me.

88
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,309
-Hello.
-Hey.

89
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,436
So Rachel called.

90
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,147
Wants to see me.

91
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,025
Going over in a minute.

92
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,071
-Wow. What do you think she wants?
-Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted...

93
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,491
...and she realizes that life without me...

94
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,659
...sucks.

95
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:55,832
It's possible. You are very lovable.
I'd miss you if I broke up with you.

96
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,668
Just trying to be supportive.

97
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,671
Well, be supportive like a guy.

98
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,050
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.

99
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,514
-Hi.
-Hi.

100
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,727
You, uh, wanted to see me?

101
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,856
Yeah.

102
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,443
Uh, here's a box of your stuff.

103
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,616
-What?
-Uh, it's just like hats and a shirt and CD's.

104
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,035
Just sort of stuff that you've left here.

105
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,288
What are you doing? Are you trying
to hurt me or something?

106
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,749
No.

107
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,293
Ross.

108
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:45,548
It just seems that, you know,
it's time we, you know, move on.

109
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,217
I mean, don't you think?

110
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,637
-Yes.
-Yeah.

111
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,389
-Yes, I do.
-Good.

112
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,641
Yeah, I really do.

113
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,560
Hey....

114
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,480
This was a gift.

115
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,650
Ross, you got that for free
from the museum gift shop.

116
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,777
It's still a gift.

117
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,488
I got it from the gift shop.

118
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,367
Okay. All right. Give me the mug.
I'll keep the mug.

119
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:16,621
No. You know, don't do me any favors.
In fact, where....

120
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,167
Where's the rest of my stuff? Huh?
Like my, urn....

121
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,671
Hey. This book is mine.

122
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:31,094
And that T-shirt you sleep in?
I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.

123
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:37,434
You know how much I love that T-shirt.
You never even wear that T-shirt.

124
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,729
I'm just trying to help you move on.

125
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,982
Oh, you are a petty man.

126
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,276
You are a petty, petty...

127
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,902
-Petty...
-...petty, petty...

128
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,362
-...small....
-...small....

129
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,577
You are so just doing this
out of spite.

130
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,579
Uh-uh. No, no, no.

131
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,874
I'm gonna wear this all the time.
I love this shirt.

132
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,420
You haven't worn that since you were 15.
It doesn't even fit you anymore.

133
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,964
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

134
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,550
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

135
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,315
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff...

136
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,859
...and relax...

137
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,945
...in my favorite shirt.

138
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,033
You have a pleasant evening.

139
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,628
So you're, like, a zillionaire.

140
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,757
And you're our age. You're our age.

141
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,010
You know what?
You should, like, buy a state...

142
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,554
...and then just name it after yourself.

143
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,515
What, like, "Pete Dakota"?

144
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,851
Or "Mississi-Pete."

145
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,689
Ooh, ooh, I got it: "Pete Chicago."

146
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,276
That's not a state, Joe.

147
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,112
Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?

148
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,535
I gotta go, so, uh,
I'll see you guys later.

149
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,037
-Okay. You're our age.
-Okay.

150
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,958
So, uh, are we on for tomorrow?

151
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,793
Absolutely.

152
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,672
Now get out of here, you.

153
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,806
Okay, I'm running out of places
I can touch him.

154
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,058
Is there something wrong with me?

155
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,019
I mean, why am I only attracted to guys
where there's no future?

156
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,814
Either they're too old
or they're too young.

157
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,149
And there's Pete,
who's crazy about me...

158
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,736
...and he's absolutely perfect,
and there's, like, zip going on.

159
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,281
Seriously. Does it sound like
something's wrong with me?

160
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,241
Yeah, kind of.

161
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,913
Happy? Is that what
I'm supposed to be, Vic?

162
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,456
Happy?

163
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,209
Well, why don't you tell me
what you're supposed to be? Huh?

164
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,837
Because I sure as hell can't figure it out.

165
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,423
I talk to you, and nothing.

166
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,050
You look at me, and it's nothing.

167
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,430
Nothing.

168
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,184
Tasty.

169
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,023
I'm really starting to feel like
you guys have a history. It's nice.

170
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,525
-I have a question about this scene.
-Yes.

171
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:37,113
Well, I don't understand
why Adrianne's attracted to Victor.

172
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,782
Peel the onion.

173
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,201
First of all, he's good-looking.

174
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,745
Yeah.

175
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,956
I think my character is gonna need
a bit more of a reason than that.

176
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,376
Oh, hey, how about this one?
Uh, it says so in the script.

177
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,299
You know, I don't know why
my character likes you either.

178
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,469
I mean, it says in the script here
that you're a bitch.

179
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,931
-It doesn't say that in the script.
-It does in mine.

180
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,312
I can blow-dry it, I can put gel on it.
It doesn't matter.

181
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,315
I still wind up with this
little cowlick-y thing...

182
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:16,069
...on the middle part of my head.
It's so annoying.

183
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,238
-Does it bug you?
-You bug me.

184
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,504
Is there any chance you didn't see that?

185
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,218
Ross, you gotta stop, okay?

186
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,346
You can't just stare through
the peephole for three hours.

187
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,684
You're gonna get peep-eye.

188
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,688
I knew it. I knew it.
I always knew she liked him.

189
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,023
She'd say no, but here we are, right?

190
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,651
We just broke up,
first thing she does.

191
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,403
You didn't just break up.

192
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,530
Hey, it's been, like, three weeks.

193
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,075
You slept with somebody three hours
after you thought you broke up.

194
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,245
I mean, bullets have left guns slower.

195
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,748
Here they come. Here they- Oh.

196
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,668
If she kisses him good night,
I'm gonna kill myself. I swear.

197
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,878
I can't watch.

198
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,673
Come on. Date over. Date over.

199
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,218
-Here we go. She's going in.
-Okay.

200
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,096
She's going in. Ha, ha.
Wait. He's going in.

201
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,558
He's going in.

202
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,562
The door's closed. I can't see
anything with the door closed.

203
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,566
And the inventor of the door
rests happily in his grave.

204
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,444
Okay, I have to do something.
I mean, I have to stop it.

205
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,195
-Stop what?
-I don't know.

206
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,407
But I have a feeling
that my being there will do it.

207
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,160
I'll go over and I will borrow something.

208
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,078
-Juice. I need juice.
-No.

209
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,580
-You can't.
-A little help.

210
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,583
-They must be stopped.
-I am your friend...

211
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,793
...and I am not gonna let you do this.

212
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,504
You are surprisingly strong.

213
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,759
-I need juice. People need juice.
-Look, man....

214
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,845
-People need juice. Juice. They need-
-Listen to me.

215
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,978
She's moving on, okay? If it's not
this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.

216
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,481
And unless you're thinking about
subletting my peephole...

217
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:20,651
...you are gonna have to get used
to the fact that the relationship is over.

218
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:24,072
Okay, man? It's over.

219
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,244
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay.

220
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,955
It's just I miss her so much.

221
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,666
I know.

222
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,380
Why do all your coffee mugs
have numbers on the bottom?

223
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,424
Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.

224
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,387
That way, if one of them is missing,
she can be like, "Where's number 27?"

225
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,522
You know what?

226
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,316
No, and I don't think
I'm gonna want to.

227
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:01,859
I can't do this.

228
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,570
Yep. Yep.
That's what I didn't want to know.

229
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,408
Yeah. Oh, Mark, I'm just doing this
for the wrong reasons, you know?

230
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,119
I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.

231
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,497
I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.

232
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,626
Ah. Fair, shmair. You know?

233
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,712
Look, you wanna get back at Ross,
I am here for you.

234
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,424
Really.

235
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,595
No, no. I say we get back at him right here
on this couch. Right here.

236
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,474
Oh, my God.

237
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,394
I'm sorry about this.

238
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,480
That's okay.

239
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,693
-You sure?
-Yeah.

240
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,489
I can just go home
and get back at him by myself.

241
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,121
<i>-and should become
the penicillin of the 21st century.</i>

242
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:59,292
And so today, this hospital
is about to take major steps...

243
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,170
...toward leading that revolution.

244
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,381
-It is truly ironic.
-Hey. Can I ask you something?

245
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,094
Where are we?

246
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,432
Well, with all these doctors and nurses...

247
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,601
...I'm gonna say, Midget Rodeo.

248
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,061
Just tell me the truth.

249
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,898
Okay.

250
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,485
Um, you know, I don't think
I told you this...

251
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,907
...but, um, I just recently got out
of a really serious relationship.

252
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,409
Oh, right. Wasn't that like a year ago?

253
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,121
So I did tell you.

254
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,957
Okay, well, you know,
that's not really the thing.

255
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,085
The thing is, is that right now
I'm just in a place in my life...

256
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,713
-...where I just need to focus on me.
-Mm.

257
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,798
-Do you know what I mean?
-Oh, yeah, I know.

258
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:54,430
-I so want to be attracted to you.
-But you're not. Okay. Good.

259
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,349
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,103
You know what? Don't be.
This is not-

261
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,397
Don't be, because it's not so bad.

262
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,777
-It's not?
-Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

263
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,615
Or someone you find attractive.

264
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,826
I just think, you know...

265
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,580
...that you might end up
feeling differently.

266
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,919
Well, look, I don't want this
to come out wrong...

267
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:30,174
...but, uh, you seem awfully confident
for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted to.

268
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,843
Yeah, stupidly charming, isn't it?

269
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,681
Uh, listen. Let's-
You wanna get something to eat?

270
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,183
Because this place is kind of depressing.

271
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:45,231
Now the man who made
this possible, Mr. Peter Becker.

272
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,941
One second.

273
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:59,370
I don't think this town is big enough
for the both of us to relax in.

274
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,083
Draw.

275
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,297
I wasn't doing anything.

276
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,264
Uh-oh. What did she do now?

277
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:23,311
Just because she went to Yale Drama,
she thinks she's, like, the greatest actress...

278
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,188
...since sliced bread.

279
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,900
Ah, Sliced Bread.
A wonderful Lady Macbeth.

280
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,363
God, I just- I hate her. I hate her
with her "Oh, I'm so talented"...

281
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,451
...and "Oh, I'm so pretty,"
and "Oh, I smell so good."

282
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,829
I think somebody has a crush
on somebody.

283
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,874
Hey, Chandler, can we please try
and stay focused on my problem here?

284
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,083
You know?

285
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,670
I'm talking about you, you big, big freak.

286
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,257
Oh.

287
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,843
Oh. You're out of your mind.

288
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,763
Hey, you've done nothing
but talk about her for the last 48 hours.

289
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,222
If you were in school yard...

290
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,684
...you'd be pulling her pigtails
and pushing her down now.

291
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,354
Oh, yeah? Then how come
I keep thinking about her...

292
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,357
...in all these sexual scenarios
and stuff, huh?

293
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,867
Happy? Is that what I'm
supposed to be, Vic? Happy?

294
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,995
Well, why don't you tell me what
you're supposed to be, huh?

295
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,581
Because I sure as hell
can't figure it out.

296
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,209
I talk to you, and it's nothing.

297
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,087
You look at me, and nothing.

298
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,309
Nothing.

299
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:51,565
You guys make me fly.

300
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,944
High.

301
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,948
Okay, we're gonna pick it up here
tomorrow.

302
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,619
-Well, that was, uh....
-Better?

303
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:07,164
Yeah, yeah, it was definitely...

304
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,041
...an improvement.

305
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,293
-Good night.
-Uh, Kate.

306
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,795
Yeah?

307
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,673
You, uh.... You forgot your shoes.

308
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,803
I'm probably gonna need those, huh?

309
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,351
-Okay.
-Hey, listen...

310
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,479
...you, uh, feel like getting
a cup of coffee?

311
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,065
-Urn- Yo.
-Kate.

312
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,151
-You ready to go?
-Yeah.

313
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,905
Very nice. Very nice.

314
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,367
So, um....

315
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,370
-See you tomorrow, huh?
-Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

316
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,038
-Right.
-Good night.

317
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,341
Hey.

318
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,554
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?

319
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,598
You know, like Goldman, Silverman?

320
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,809
Because it's not his last name.

321
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,188
-It isn't?
-No, it's not, like....

322
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,023
Like Phil Spiderman.

323
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,444
He's a spider...

324
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,154
...man.

325
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,408
You know, like, uh-
Like Goldman is a last name.

326
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,911
But there's no gold man.

327
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,371
Oh, okay.

328
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,207
There should be a Gold Man.

329
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,419
-Hey.
-Hey, Rach.

330
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,213
-How was work?
-Oh, great.

331
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,382
Although I did sit down
where there wasn't a chair.

332
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,719
By the way, Ross dropped by
a box of your stuff.

333
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:47,223
Oh. Well, I guess I had that one coming.

334
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,393
I'm just gonna throw it out.
It's probably just a bunch of shampoo and-

335
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,146
Something wrong?

336
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,241
Hmm. No. Nothing.

337
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,793
So, uh, what kind of powers
would Gold Man have?

338
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,214
Okay. Well, he would turn things to gold.

339
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,927
-What about things that are already gold?
-Ah. His work is done.

340
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,846
Okay, let's play my game.

341
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,098
Okay.

342
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,977
All right, you yellow-bellied,
lily-livered-

343
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,478
Draw.

344
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,774
Yeah, it's fun.
