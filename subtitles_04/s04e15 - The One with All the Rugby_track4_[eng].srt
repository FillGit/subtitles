1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,713
I'm can't believe
I'm getting my nails done.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,424
And you said it was gonna be fun.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,801
Which it kind of is.

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:14,181
You said there were gonna be other guys.
There are no other guys.

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:18,852
-Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
-That's a mailman.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,188
That's our mailman.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,774
Hi, how are you?

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:32,032
Chandler, don't worry.
This doesn't make you any less of a guy.

9
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,034
That does.

10
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,704
What am I sitting on?

11
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:43,377
Heh. I'd hate to think what this woman
was scratching when this broke off.

12
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,963
-Know who used to have nails like that?
-No.

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,050
Oh, my God.

14
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,814
Joey, let me ask you a question.
This has been driving me crazy.

15
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,317
-What does this light switch do?
-Oh, nothing.

16
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,445
Didn't it drive you crazy
to not know what it did?

17
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,655
I know what it did. Nothing.

18
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,035
They wouldn't have put it there
if it didn't do something.

19
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,996
-How can you not care?
-Like this:

20
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,834
Well, here's another question for you.

21
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,754
Do you know what that little silver knob
on the toilet does?

22
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,089
-Sure. It flushes it.
-Okay, good.

23
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:15,761
Now, since you know, when you come over,
would you mind actually using it?

24
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,765
-Hello.
-Hey. Aah!

25
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,853
-Oh, my God. Wow.
-Guess who we ran into today?

26
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,691
-Janice.
-Is this amazing?

27
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,028
-How have you been?
-Well, um, I'm divorced.

28
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,030
-Wow.
-Really?

29
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,491
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.

30
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,995
And there it is.

31
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,916
I just came up to say hi. Hi.

32
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,419
-You, sweetie, I'll see you later.
-Okay.

33
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,129
Mwah. I'll see you tonight.

34
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,756
-Bye. Bye.
-Bye. Bye.

35
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,342
-Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye.
-Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Oh.

36
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,135
I can't stand the woman.

37
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,973
What?
I thought you were crazy about her.

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,519
You know all those little annoying things
she did before we fell in love?

39
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,980
You know, like her voice and her laugh
and her personality?

40
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,692
Well, they're all back, you know.

41
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,611
And she's picked up like nine new ones.

42
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,823
So, what are you doing bringing her here?
There's people here.

43
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,285
Don't worry about it.
I'm taking care of it tonight.

44
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,580
You are not. You have never been able
to break up with her.

45
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,624
Well, I don't have to break up with her.

46
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,460
We're not involved.
I'm gonna do a preemptive strike.

47
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,588
I'm gonna end it with her before it starts.

48
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,258
My ass is, like, frozen.

49
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,470
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer
for 20 minutes.

50
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,392
I'm telling you.

51
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,527
I can't believe
you really walk alone here at night.

52
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,155
I mean,
you hear such stories about New York.

53
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,115
No, it's really not that bad.

54
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,367
I mean, I, for one, feel perfectly safe.

55
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,290
Help! Help! Help!

56
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,835
No, no, no, Ross.
Ross, these are friends of mine from home.

57
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,005
-Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
-Oh. Heh.

58
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,214
-Hi, mate.
-Hey.

59
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,632
-How are you, man?
-Ha, ha.

60
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,344
That was a good one, huh?
I was like, "Help! Help!"

61
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,013
So how are you?

62
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,640
I've been meaning to ring you
ever since I arrived...

63
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,351
...but, um, well, I've been rather busy.

64
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,980
You realize we have not seen each other
since the night of that U2 concert?

65
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,357
-Ah.
-Oh, my God, I think you're right.

66
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,944
Well, actually, the last time you and I
saw each other was the next morning.

67
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,322
Ha, ha. Oh, Liam.

68
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,492
Heh. Oh, Liam.

69
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,162
So, what, were you guys playing soccer
or something?

70
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,580
Or should I call it...

71
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,665
..."football"? Uh....

72
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,251
We were playing rugby.

73
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,797
In fact, we're playing a game tomorrow.
You're welcome to play too.

74
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,175
Ha, ha. Ross play rugby? I don't think so.

75
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,385
Heh. What...?

76
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,012
What's so funny about that?

77
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,057
Well, I mean, you're American,
to start with.

78
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,059
You don't really have rugby here.

79
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:14,648
Heh. Well, we didn't have freedom here
until 1776 either, so....

80
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,567
So good, then.
We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2.

81
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,111
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

82
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:32,249
Oh, boy. I just love to sing.

83
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,792
Yes, I know that you do.

84
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,044
One of the reasons
people were complaining...

85
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:40,298
...was because most of the people had paid
to hear the actor sing "Old Man River."

86
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,133
Oh, look at us.

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,054
Who would've thought that Cupid
had a station at 14th Street Nails?

88
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,350
Okay, we have to talk.

89
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,564
I'm just getting out
of a very serious relationship.

90
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,608
I know.
And I'm just getting out of a marriage.

91
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,820
I mean, talk about meant to be.

92
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:06,324
Right. But I just think
this is happening too soon.

93
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,661
Oh, too soon, too schmoon.

94
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:13,290
Face it, honey,
I am not letting you get away this time.

95
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,251
-I hear you.
-Ha, ha.

96
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,300
But unfortunately, my company...

97
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,969
...is transferring me overseas.

98
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,889
Oh, no.

99
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,142
Where to?

100
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,687
-To Paris?
-No. No, not Paris.

101
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,774
To London? Oh. No, Rome?
Vienna? Ooh, ooh. Barcelona?

102
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,819
Okay, could you just stop talking
for a second?

103
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,323
Yemen.

104
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,537
That's right. Yes.
I'm being transferred to Yemen.

105
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,790
-When?
-I don't know exactly.

106
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:02,756
Well, I will just have to soak up
every ounce of Chandler Bing...

107
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,176
...until that moment comes.

108
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,138
But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.

109
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,144
-Done?
-Yep.

110
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,938
-Hey.
-Hey.

111
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,356
What's up?

112
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,524
This switch thing
has been driving me crazy.

113
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,027
So I turned it off
and checked every outlet.

114
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:28,281
Now, four don't work, which means one
of them has to be controlled by the switch.

115
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,035
So I plugged in things in all four outlets
that make noise.

116
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,746
That way, when I turn it on,
I just follow the noise...

117
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,748
...and find out which one it is.

118
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,293
I bet I stopped listening before you did.

119
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,214
You know,
you also could have used lamps...

120
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,882
...and then followed the light.

121
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:50,845
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay?

122
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,472
All right, so everybody ready?

123
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,225
Here we go.

124
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:01,398
There's something.
I hear something. Where is it?

125
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,743
It's coming from Joey.

126
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,665
Oh, my God. That's so freaky.
Turn him off.

127
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,547
<i>-with the set scrum in center field.</i>

128
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,549
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.

129
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:31,136
Could we put on the news?
I think it might be raining.

130
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,432
No, just hold on a sec.
I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN.

131
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,852
I don't know what the big deal is.
I'm man enough to play this sport.

132
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:43,023
Dude, you're not even man enough
to order the channel that carries the sport.

133
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,609
Hey there, Ross.

134
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,945
Hey.

135
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,613
Janice.

136
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:56,244
You know, uh,
you really didn't have to help me pack.

137
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,413
Oh. When you said
all you were gonna be doing...

138
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,915
...between now and the time you leave
is packing...

139
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,293
...you really didn't leave me much choice.

140
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,129
Well, I thought I did,
but I guess I did not.

141
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,967
-Hey. What's going on?
-Oh, I'm packing.

142
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,429
You know, I'm packing
because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.

143
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,931
Thanks for telling me.

144
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,480
I'm only pretend-moving to Yemen, okay?
It's the only way I can get rid of her.

145
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,857
Oh. Good one.

146
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,737
And Yemen.
That actually sounds like a real country.

147
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,989
Hey, Chandler, come on.

148
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,493
I'm gonna show you how to roll
your underwear and stuff it in your shoes.

149
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,705
-It's a real space-saver.
-I do that because it makes me look taller.

150
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,043
Hey, Chandler. Come on.

151
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,294
Okay.

152
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,088
-Joey, trade lives with me.
-Nope.

153
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,843
Man, look at this.
Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play.

154
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,805
-Look how brutal this is.
-Hey, I can handle it, all right?

155
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,098
Oh, please, Ross.

156
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,310
You got hurt playing badminton
with my dad.

157
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:06,064
That's because your mom's dog
kept looking at me.

158
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,194
Okay, Ross, look, look, look.
Right here, it's called a "scrum," okay?

159
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,323
-It's kind of like a huddle.
-And is a hum kind of like a scruddle?

160
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,160
Ross, they're gonna kill you.

161
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,914
Why are you doing this, anyway?

162
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,626
Well, you should've seen the guy
that she used to go out with.

163
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,962
I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.

164
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,340
You're kidding. And he plays rugby?
That's so funny.

165
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,511
Oh, I see. You did that. All right.

166
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,559
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me
playing rugby with him was, like, hilarious.

167
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,270
So I'm gonna show her
how tough I really am.

168
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,192
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're right.
You are a tough guy.

169
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,570
You're the toughest paleontologist
I know.

170
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,238
All right, come on.

171
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,741
Look, Ross can take care of himself.
It's not like he's Chandler.

172
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,577
Thanks.

173
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,704
Look, don't worry about me.

174
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:06,416
I'll just look real energetic
and stay away from the ball.

175
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,751
I'll be that guy, right outside the circle.

176
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,713
-Ooh.
-Oh!

177
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,215
Oh, jeez.

178
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,094
Oh. Well, maybe there was a dog
looking at him.

179
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,104
Okay, Ross, Ross, Ross.

180
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,608
You're gonna wanna stay away
from that guy and that guy and that one.

181
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,235
Dude, they're all huge.

182
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,779
They don't look any bigger than me.

183
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,781
That's because you're closer to you.

184
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,992
So you look bigger to you
from where you are.

185
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,038
I'm just gonna go and say hello
to the lads.

186
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,956
-All right.
-Okay.

187
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,377
Hi.

188
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,670
Oh.

189
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,007
I kind of liked it.

190
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,095
Okay, I know what I've gotta do.
I've gotta go Red Ross.

191
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,475
You know, Red Ross?

192
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,685
Totally don't know
what you're talking about.

193
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,980
That time that we were all waiting in line
for <i>Dances With Wolves...</i>

194
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,317
...and that one guy cut in front of us,
and I just lost it?

195
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,779
Huh? Screamed at him, turned all red.

196
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,405
Red Ross!

197
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,075
No.

198
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,494
You'll see.

199
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,330
Liam, do me a favor.

200
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,667
Tell the lads to go easy on Ross.
It's his first time.

201
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,585
You don't say?

202
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,094
-Thanks.
-Okay.

203
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,846
Good luck, babe.

204
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,391
Ross. Ross, come on, get in here.

205
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,353
Ross, come on.

206
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,527
Ross.

207
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,779
Ross, come on, get in the bloody scrum.

208
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,198
Ross, get in.

209
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,461
Joey!

210
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,926
Oh. You are not gonna believe it.
Joshua came in today, and guess what.

211
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,553
-He asked you out?
-No.

212
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,640
But I was showing him some cuff links,
and I felt his pulse.

213
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,519
Saucy.

214
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:36,232
-What are these?
-Oh. Electrical plans for the building.

215
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,111
Okay, okay, okay, should I be scared?

216
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,240
I know that switch has gotta do something.
So I went to City Hall and I got these.

217
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,201
All I had to do was pay $25
and wait in line for three hours.

218
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,830
Wow. If only more people knew.

219
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,679
You know, you really didn't have to take me
to the airport.

220
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,932
Oh, please. Every moment is precious.

221
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,227
Besides, somebody had to ride
in that other taxi with your luggage.

222
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,564
And your friends don't seem to care
very much that you're leaving.

223
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,067
Well, we're not really that close.

224
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,280
Okay. So I guess this is, uh,
you know, goodbye, then.

225
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,823
Oh, no, no.

226
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,993
It's not goodbye.
I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.

227
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,706
Okay, well,
I guess it's just "wait here," then.

228
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,087
Hi. I need a fake ticket to Yemen.

229
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,757
-One ticket to Yemen?
-Oh, no, no, no.

230
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,468
I just need a pretend ticket.

231
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,678
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.

232
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,848
What would you give to a kid
if he wanted a ticket to play with?

233
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,518
Are you traveling with a child?

234
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,437
No.

235
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,775
Oh. She's gonna think
that I'm handing you a credit card.

236
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,737
But what I'm really gonna do
is hand you a library card.

237
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:10,868
Uh, sir, a ticket to Yemen is $2100,
and we don't take library cards.

238
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,871
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

239
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,040
Do you have to stay?

240
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,710
American Express?

241
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,883
Ross!

242
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,179
-Oh.
-Ah.

243
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,724
I can't believe they're doing that to him.
I told them to go easy on him.

244
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,352
No offense, but sometimes it's hard
to understand you...

245
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,437
...you know, with the accent, so....

246
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,441
-That's just halftime. There's more of this.
-Oh.

247
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,651
-Hey.
-Hey.

248
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,194
Hey.

249
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,991
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh?
That is one fun game.

250
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,952
-Right.
-Do me a favor? Grab me a bottle of water?

251
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,871
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

252
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,834
-I think I'm dying. I really do.
-Oh, poor baby.

253
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,794
Tell my son that I love him.

254
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,591
Oh, excellent.
Okay, gotta have some more fun.

255
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,509
Ross, they are killing you out there.

256
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,264
-That's not true.
-She's right. You have to stop.

257
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,601
What? No. No, I'm not stopping.
I'm Red Ross.

258
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,979
Dude, you go back out there,
you're gonna be Dead Ross.

259
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,399
I don't care. I am not quitting.
I am gonna finish this game.

260
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,569
All right. If you insist on doing this,
at least let me help you.

261
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:30,781
God, no. That is no place for a woman.
Those guys will grab anything.

262
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,242
That's not what I was saying.

263
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,621
I just might know a few things
that could help you inflict some pain.

264
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,166
-I like that.
-Yeah? Listen closely.

265
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,418
-Devon has got a weak ankle.
-Huh?

266
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,670
One swift kick and he'll back off.

267
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,589
All right, bad ankle. Got it.

268
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,674
-And that big bloke with the beard?
-Uh-huh.

269
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,593
-He's got a trick hip.
-Ha, ha.

270
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,639
Yeah. And David over there,
I heard that he doesn't wear a cup.

271
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,059
Real-? I could use that.
Trick hip, no cup. Okay, okay.

272
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,811
And Liam. Liam's got bad knees.

273
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,189
You hit him right
and he'll go down like a lamp.

274
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,066
But Liam's on my team.

275
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,277
-I don't care. You just get him.
-Go get him.

276
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,489
Okay. I am going back in.

277
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,328
Red Ross. Yeah.

278
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,124
-Hi.
-Hi.

279
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,588
What are these?

280
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,133
Oh, just some pictures I made
and hung up.

281
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,512
I thought they'd brighten up the place.
They do, don't you think?

282
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,183
-Aah!
-No, no, don't, don't.

283
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,352
Oh!

284
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:46,649
I know that there's no hole there.
I just really like that picture.

285
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,696
Oh, my God. Look at this.

286
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,324
But there is a wire back there.
That switch is connected to something.

287
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,412
I don't care.
The wires have come loose in your head.

288
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,915
I thought if I could follow the wire,
I could find out what it did.

289
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,002
-And did you?
-No.

290
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,546
It disappears
back behind that baseboard.

291
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,674
For a minute there,
I thought it went downstairs.

292
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,180
But it didn't.

293
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,768
-Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.
-Oh, my God.

294
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,814
-Hello, darling.
-Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.

295
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,612
Are you sure
you don't wanna go see a doctor?

296
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,949
Oh, no, that'll just bring me down.

297
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:41,245
This was great. I mean, I was great.
This was a great day.

298
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,873
You know what?
I'm buying everyone coffee.

299
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,167
Someone just grab my wallet.
It's in my pocket.

300
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,501
-Yeah, sure.
-No, not you.

301
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,128
Okay.

302
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,882
Look, your eye's still popping out a little.
I'm gonna go get some ice.

303
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,635
-Okay.
-Ooh, ice, yeah. I'm so in the mood for ice.

304
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,598
-You were amazing out there.
-Oh.

305
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,476
-I kind of was, wasn't I?
-Oh, my God.

306
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:07,813
I made a man twice my size cry.

307
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,860
I mean, I haven't done that since I was 4
and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.

308
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,822
You really enjoyed yourself, didn't you?

309
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,742
Please, are you kidding?
I hurt three huge men.

310
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,744
I gave a guy a bloody nose.

311
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,497
I mean, I'm not proud of it...

312
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,499
...but I really am.

313
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,919
And it's all because of you.

314
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:34,840
-Yeah. Wonderful, amazing you.
-I think you've got a concussion.

315
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,593
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.

316
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,805
You're welcome.

317
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:46,143
-I'm sorry. Did that hurt you?
-It's worth the pain.

318
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,022
You know what?
You know what? It's not.

319
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:59,782
<i>This is the final boarding
call for Flight 664 to Yemen.</i>

320
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,453
Well, I guess I gotta go.

321
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,581
Oh. My Bing-a-ling.

322
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,835
I'll wait for you.

323
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,129
Do you even know
how long you're gonna be gone?

324
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:19,510
Well, just until we find an energy source
to replace fuel.

325
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,848
Oh. Well, I'll write you every day.

326
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,143
15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

327
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,063
Okay. Goodbye.

328
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,815
Goodbye.

329
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,329
-Chandler?
-No.

330
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,290
Chandler.

331
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,668
Janice. There you are. There you are.
I had to have one last kiss.

332
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:56,505
And also, also, you said you were
gonna leave right after I got on the plane.

333
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,885
No. No. I wanna see you take off.

334
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,054
Well, then I guess I'm going to Yemen.

335
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,184
I'm going to Yemen.

336
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,897
When we get to Yemen,
can I stay with you?

337
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,948
All right.
The super couldn't figure out what it did.

338
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:27,161
The $200-an-hour electrician
couldn't figure out what it did.

339
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,539
I've had seven pretty serious shocks.

340
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,418
-I officially give up.
-Thank God.

341
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,379
I guess Joey was right.

342
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,840
It does nothing.

343
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,305
See?

344
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:54,063
I'm doing it. I am totally doing it.

345
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,738
I lost it.
