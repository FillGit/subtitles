1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,674
Wow. That ripped.

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,386
That ripped real nice.

3
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:16,099
How many times do I have to tell you?
You turn and slide.

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,018
You know? Turn and slide.

5
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,103
No, you don't turn and slide.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,855
You throw it out.

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,276
I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot
every time I get dressed.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,531
Well, we're not throwing it out.
I built this thing with my own hands.

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,907
All right.

10
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,867
How about we sell it?

11
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,204
All right.

12
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,165
But you're gonna have to tell them.

13
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,297
You mind if we stick you in a different
cabinet? They seem all right with it.

14
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,892
<i>-Monica, it's Chip.
</i>-Yes.

15
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,352
-Who's Chip?
-Shh.

16
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,104
<i>It was good running into you today.</i>

17
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,025
<i>So, uh, here's my number. 555-9323.
Give me a call. Later.</i>

18
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,485
Chip is Chip Matthews.

19
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,448
The guy who took Rachel to the prom?
Why's he calling you?

20
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:58,535
Because I ran into him at the bank.
He is still so cute.

21
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,539
Monica, you're so lucky.
He's, like, the most popular guy in school.

22
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,417
I know.

23
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,755
Chip? Hi, it's Monica.

24
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,591
Okay.

25
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,885
Okay.

26
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,596
Okay.

27
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,473
Okay. Goodbye.

28
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,976
Oh, my God.
We just had the best conversation.

29
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,568
-I was just leaving.
-Good.

30
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,820
Because I've got a product report
to read.

31
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,741
It's, like, eight pages.
I hope I don't fall asleep.

32
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,451
Why? Did you write it?

33
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,373
Whoa.

34
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,957
Look at that.

35
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,169
Chip Matthews called.
I wonder what he wants.

36
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,255
Well, uh, actually....

37
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,968
I bet he sensed that I was ready
to have sex with another guy.

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,767
Well, urn....

39
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,686
Why don't you give him a call?

40
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,861
Okay.

41
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:22,202
-Are you sure you want to hear this?
-Oh, I'm sure.

42
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,374
Chip. Hi, it's Rachel.

43
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,334
Rachel Green.

44
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,462
Yeah. Um, you left me a message?

45
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,675
Yes, you did.
My roommate wrote it down.

46
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,928
Monica Geller?

47
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,808
Oh.

48
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,562
Oh, that's right.

49
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,733
He called to ask out Monica.

50
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,612
That's got to be embarrassing.

51
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:06,329
<i>Dumb drunken bitch</i>

52
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,711
Thank you. Thanks. Ha, ha.

53
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,339
Now here's a question.

54
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,593
Where'd you guys get the "finest oak
east of the Mississippi"?

55
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,513
Uh-uh. First you tell us where you got
the prettiest lace in all the land.

56
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,432
I'm reading your ad.

57
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,143
-Looks good, huh?
-Yeah.

58
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,813
"Stunning entertainment center, fine-

59
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,525
Fine Italian craftsmanship."

60
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,030
Oh, my God. You guys are selling
the entertainment center?

61
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,115
-Why? I love that thing.
-You want it?

62
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,201
-Oh, no.
-No.

63
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,204
Uh, Gepetto?

64
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,457
Five thousand dollars?

65
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,417
Are you insane?

66
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,545
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks.

67
00:04:55,712 --> 00:05:00,759
All right, look, I'm changing it to $50
or your best offer.

68
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:05,096
What kind of profit is that?
And you call yourself an accountant?

69
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,225
No.

70
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,646
Oh.

71
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,649
What do you do?

72
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,152
I can't believe you don't know
what I do for a living.

73
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,239
-I actually don't know.
-Yeah, something to do with numbers?

74
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,037
Oh, my God, no. Shoo, kitty. No.

75
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,541
No, no. Shoo. Come on, you. Come on.

76
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,084
Crazy.

77
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,795
-Oh, my God.
-What?

78
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,214
Nothing. Nothing.

79
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,674
What? What's wrong?

80
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,884
I just....

81
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,890
I just have this really strong feeling
that this cat is my mother.

82
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,936
You mean, the mom you met in Montauk?
She was a cat?

83
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,314
No. No, no. She was a human lady.

84
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:00,193
This is the spirit of my mom, Lily.
The one that killed herself.

85
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,820
Are you sure she's in the cat?

86
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:05,073
Or have you been taking your grandma's
glaucoma medicine again?

87
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,326
No, Dr. Skeptismo.

88
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,497
I'm sure. First of all,
okay, there's the feeling.

89
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,086
Okay, and for another, how about the fact
that she went into my guitar case...

90
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,547
...which is lined with orange felt.

91
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,636
My mother's favorite fish
was orange roughy.

92
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,559
Cats like fish.

93
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,814
Hi, Mommy.

94
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,570
Oh. I haven't seen this smile in 17 years.

95
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,409
-Dude, Phoebe's mom's got a huge pair of-
-Let it go.

96
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,997
Hey.

97
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,251
Um, when were you gonna tell me
that you're going out with Chip Matthews?

98
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,378
Now?

99
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,842
-Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
-No. It's not okay.

100
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,720
I can't believe you'd want to
after what he did to me.

101
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,263
What, that thing at the prom?

102
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,268
Monica, I couldn't find him for two hours.
He was having sex with Amy Welsh.

103
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,898
Come on, that was back in high school.
How could that still bother you?

104
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,859
I mean, why of all people
do you have to go out with Chip?

105
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,778
Look, you and I went to different schools.

106
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,948
Okay, that doesn't help because
we went to the same high school.

107
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,200
You went to one
where you were popular.

108
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,535
And you got to ride off
on Chip's motorcycle...

109
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,496
...and wear his letterman jacket.

110
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:38,917
I went to one where I wore a band uniform
that you had to have specially made.

111
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,754
They had to have that specially made?

112
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,300
It was a project
for one of the Home Ec. classes.

113
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,722
Oh, my God.
They told us that was for the mascot.

114
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,436
Back then I thought
that I'd never, ever get the chance...

115
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,397
...to go out with a Chip Matthews.

116
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,483
And now he's called me up
and asked me out.

117
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,737
And the fat girl inside of me
really wants to go. I owe her this.

118
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,656
I never let her eat.

119
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,076
-Oh, you go out with him.
-Oh, really?

120
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,285
Yeah.

121
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,579
If it's possible,
could you leave him somewhere...

122
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,707
...and go have sex with another guy?

123
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,792
I'll try.

124
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,257
So you guys having any luck
getting rid of the entertainment center?

125
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,050
There were a couple calls last night...

126
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,761
...but, uh, I don't think any of them
are gonna work out.

127
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,056
Yes, Joey has a very careful
screening process.

128
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,518
Apparently not everyone is qualified
to own wood and nails.

129
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,688
Stop it. Stop it.

130
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,566
She keeps squirming
and trying to get away.

131
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,693
Just like when she was alive.

132
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,281
So, Pheebs, how long is your mom
gonna be with us?

133
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,199
Well, I'm not sure.

134
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,286
I mean, I guess until she, you know,
gets used to the fact that there's...

135
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,663
...you know, a new mom.

136
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,543
You know, I think she's worried
that she's gonna be replaced.

137
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,504
Well, that's not gonna happen, is it? No.

138
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,382
Okay, I have to return a call
in the other room.

139
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,342
Why can't you use the phone in here?

140
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:16,222
Well, I'm returning a call from
a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.

141
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,725
I just spelled the wrong word.

142
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:26,441
So, guys, am I crazy or does Phoebe's mom
remind anyone else of a cat?

143
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,236
-Ross, don't start.
-Come on.

144
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,657
You can't tell me you actually believe
that there's a woman inside that cat?

145
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,993
I believe it.

146
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,830
-No, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

147
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,582
No, you-

148
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,335
You know what?

149
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,837
You're not gonna suck me into this.

150
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:52,175
Oh, sure I am.
Because you always have to be right.

151
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,469
I do not always have- Okay, okay.

152
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,141
<i>Jurassic Park </i>could happen.

153
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,405
Wow. That's, uh- That's pretty nice.

154
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,491
"Pretty nice"?

155
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,619
You'll have to pardon my roommate.
He wanted to marry this.

156
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,165
We don't have 50 bucks.
But would you be willing to trade for it?

157
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,375
We got a canoe.

158
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,718
You know,
I really don't think we need a canoe.

159
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,262
You gotta take the canoe.

160
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,890
All right, just....

161
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,309
Just take the entertainment center.

162
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,354
And then when you get home,
throw the canoe away.

163
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,566
We're not throwing it away.
I built that canoe.

164
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,402
Good for you.

165
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,619
You guys, you're never gonna believe
what I just found on a telephone pole.

166
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,371
Looks kind of familiar?

167
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,500
Apparently Phoebe's mother
also goes by the name Julio.

168
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,380
You guys, there's a little girl
in SoHo looking for this cat.

169
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:16,593
-I mean, you know what that means?
-Yeah, 200-dollar reward split five ways.

170
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,889
Do we have to tell her?

171
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,059
-Yes, we have to tell her.
-Oh, but it's made her so happy.

172
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,104
Little girl misses her cat.

173
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:32,192
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.

174
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,528
Okay, ha, ha, you know what?
I have to go have dinner with my son.

175
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,615
Can I trust that when you see Phoebe,
you will tell her?

176
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,617
Yeah.

177
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,160
Thank you.

178
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,456
Ugh. I hate it when Ross is right.

179
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,833
-He is right, isn't he?
-You know what?

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,877
This might be one of the times
when he's wrong.

181
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,213
-You think?
-Oh, no, he's right.

182
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,219
-Hi.
-Hi. Hey.

183
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,181
Uh, Pheebs, ahem....

184
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,226
-About your mom, heh.
-Yeah?

185
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,939
How's that going?

186
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,275
So great.
Oh, we took a nap together today.

187
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,819
My mom fell asleep on my tummy
and purred.

188
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,074
That's so sweet.

189
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,078
I'm gonna get some coffee.

190
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,504
Huh? What'd you say, Joe?
I'll be right there.

191
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,261
-Pheebs....
-I just feel so....

192
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,638
-All right.
-I'm coming already.

193
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,647
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

194
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,863
-Hello, Chip.
-Hey, Rach. How you doing?

195
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,532
I'm great. I'm great.

196
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,827
Got a great job at Bloomingdale's.
I have wonderful friends.

197
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,954
And even though I'm not
seeing anyone right now...

198
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,665
...I've really never felt better
about myself.

199
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,585
So, uh, Monica ready yet?

200
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,049
She'll be out in a second.

201
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,303
So, Chip, how's, urn, Amy Welsh?

202
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,639
Amy Welsh?
Wow, I haven't seen her since-

203
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,518
So, Monica about ready?

204
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,565
This is the unit for you, my friend.

205
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,609
Sturdy construction,
tons of storage compartments.

206
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,029
Some big enough to fit a grown man.

207
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:42,905
What?

208
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,783
Oh, yeah, I got in there myself once.

209
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,244
My roommate bet me 5 bucks
that I couldn't.

210
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,913
And then he stuck a board
through the handles and locked me in.

211
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,707
Ha, ha. Yeah.

212
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,710
It was funny till I started feeling
like I was in a coffin.

213
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,215
No, you- You can't fit in that thing.
That's not deep enough.

214
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,217
Oh, yeah?

215
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,763
If I can't...

216
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,348
...I'll knock 5 bucks off the price
of the unit.

217
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,768
-All right, you have yourself a deal.
-Okay.

218
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,233
See? I told you.

219
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,906
Sometimes I come in here
just to get away from it.

220
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,951
Hey, a nickel.

221
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,582
Here we are.

222
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,834
Oh, my God, you still have the Chipper.

223
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,503
The what?

224
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,298
That's what we used to call
your, uh, motorcycle in high school.

225
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,384
You know, a motorcycle's a chopper.

226
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,469
And you're Chip.

227
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,304
Never mind.

228
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,973
No, I think it's cute.

229
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,354
Wow.

230
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,523
A lipper from the Chipper.

231
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,777
So are you still in touch
with anyone from high school?

232
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,154
Um, there's Rachel...

233
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,241
...and that's it. How about you?

234
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,618
Oh, yeah, I still hang
with Simens and Zana.

235
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,663
You know, and I see Spindler a lot,
and Levine, Kelly.

236
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,832
And I run into Goldie
from time to time...

237
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,417
...Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire...

238
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,837
...J.T., Beardsley.

239
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,463
Is that all?

240
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,675
Ah, you know, after high school,
you just kind of lose touch.

241
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,011
Oh, yeah, I ran into Richard Dorfman.

242
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,680
-Oh, how is he?
-Not so good.

243
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,307
Me and Simens gave him a wedgie.
Ha-ha-ha.

244
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,311
-Isn't he an architect now?
-Yeah, they still wear underwear.

245
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,368
Oh, my God.

246
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,539
What?

247
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,794
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

248
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,839
What happened?

249
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,968
Oh, man, he promised
he wouldn't take the chairs.

250
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,512
What the hell happened?
How were you locked in there?

251
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,056
Where the hell is all of our stuff?

252
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,517
Well, this guy came by
to look at the unit...

253
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,437
...and he said he didn't think
it was big enough to fit a grown man.

254
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,732
So you got in voluntarily?

255
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,610
I was trying to make a sale.

256
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,113
Oh, man. If I ever run into that guy again,
you know what I'm gonna do?

257
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,240
Bend over?

258
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,873
And then Zana just let one rip.

259
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,465
Look, not that I don't enjoy talking about
people who we went to high school with...

260
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,675
-...because I do.
-Ha, ha.

261
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,178
But, urn, maybe we can talk
about something else.

262
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,722
Like you.
I don't even know where you work.

263
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,308
-You know where I work.
-I do?

264
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,394
The movie theater.
You used to come in all the time.

265
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,942
-You still work at the Multiplex?
-Like I'd give up that job. Ha, ha.

266
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,070
Free popcorn and candy
any time I want?

267
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,948
-I can get you free posters for your room.
-Thanks, I'm set.

268
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,576
Do you live with your parents?

269
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,954
Yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.

270
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,379
Wow, they really got you guys.
Your TV, the chairs.

271
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,298
Yeah, your microwave, the stereo.

272
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,885
Oh, man, he took the five of spades.

273
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,554
Oh, no, no, here it is.

274
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,100
Oh, my God. What happened?

275
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:43,938
Oh. Um, Joey was born, and then
28 years later, I was robbed.

276
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,819
So how was your date?

277
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:53,406
Well, you know how I always wanted
to go out with Chip in high school?

278
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,827
Well, tonight, I actually went out
with Chip Matthews in high school.

279
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,246
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

280
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,332
No, it's okay. Not only did I get
to go out with Chip Matthews...

281
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,293
...I got to dump Chip Matthews.

282
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,337
-Oh, that's so great.
-I know.

283
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,132
-Hey.
-Hey.

284
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,301
So, uh,
what did the insurance company say?

285
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,510
Oh, they said, uh:

286
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:18,014
"You don't have insurance here,
so stop calling us."

287
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,810
You didn't tell her?

288
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,524
Okay, fine.

289
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,818
-Pheebs?
-Yeah. Hi.

290
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,113
Hi. Listen, uh...

291
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,658
...this cat belongs to a little girl.

292
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,120
All right?
There are flyers all over the place.

293
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,497
I'm sorry, sweetie.

294
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,751
Hey, we can take her
back with you if you want.

295
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,588
Oh. Mm-hm.

296
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:54,258
But, you know, she chose to find me.

297
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,761
I mean, I have to respect her decision,
right?

298
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,057
-That's a good call.
-That's right.

299
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,809
No, no. Hey, enough is enough.

300
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,395
Look, I'm sorry
that you feel guilty or whatever...

301
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,107
...about spending time with your new mom.
But this is not your old mom.

302
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,776
This is a cat. Okay?

303
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,570
Julio the cat.

304
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,614
Not Mom. Cat.

305
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,580
It's okay.

306
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,250
Ross, how many parents have you lost?

307
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,753
None.

308
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,632
Okay, then you don't know what it feels like
when one of them comes back. Do you?

309
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,430
I believe this is my mother.

310
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,933
Even if I'm wrong, who cares?

311
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,561
Just be a friend, okay? Be supportive.

312
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,149
I'm sorry.

313
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,735
Okay.

314
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,406
I don't know what to say. Heh.

315
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,121
You could say you're sorry to her mom.

316
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,921
I think she would like that.

317
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,727
Come here. Here, come here, come here.

318
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,689
Mrs. Buffay?

319
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,318
Sorry about what I said.

320
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:40,781
Um, it was insensitive of me to say...

321
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,284
...that you were just a cat.

322
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:50,833
When, clearly, you are also
the reincarnated spirit...

323
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,460
...of my friend's mother.

324
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,089
Thank you.

325
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,758
-We both forgive you.
-Heh.

326
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,429
What are you gonna do
about the little girl?

327
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,348
Yeah. Okay, listen.

328
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:10,853
Um, Mom, I hope you know
that you still mean a lot to me.

329
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,606
And you're welcome
to come back any time.

330
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,483
Pheebs?

331
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,236
If she could come back as a couch,
we'd really appreciate it.

332
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,781
Come on, Mom,
I'm gonna take you home.

333
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,117
-I'll go with you.
-Me too.

334
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,079
Oh, uh, you know, I got an extra futon.

335
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,167
Dude, you don't have to brag.
We got nothing here.
