1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,547
Okay, so we went to the beach because
Phoebe found out about this lady...

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:06,924
...who knew her mom and dad...

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,384
...and I don't really know
what happened with that.

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,553
-I'm your mother.
-Huh?

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,431
<i>Monica joked that she wouldn't
go out with a guy like Chandler.</i>

6
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,099
-Hi there.
-<i>He couldn't let it go.</i>

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:20,395
<i>I don't really know what happened with that.
And then Ross' new girlfriend shows up...</i>

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,773
<i>...and Rachel convinced her
to shave her head.</i>

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,566
<i>And then Ross and Rachel kiss.</i>

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,402
<i>And now Ross has to choose
between Rachel and the bald girl.</i>

11
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,405
And I don't know what happened
there either.

12
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,824
You know what? Hold on.
Let me go get Chandler.

13
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,797
Hi.

14
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,465
-Hi.
-Hey.

15
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,719
Rachel was just helping me out.
My head got all sunburned.

16
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,471
Aw.

17
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,725
-Thanks a million.
-Oh, you're welcome a million.

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,645
-Okay, I'll be in our room.
-Uh.

19
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,534
Oh, my God.

20
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,327
I know.

21
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,875
-Okay, I gotta go.
-Whoa. What? Why?

22
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,920
Uh, I gotta go break up with Bonnie.

23
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,089
Here? Now?

24
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,466
Well, yeah, I can't stay here all night.

25
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,720
And if I go in there,
she's gonna want to...

26
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,929
...do stuff.

27
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,766
Can't you just tell here
that you are not in the mood?

28
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,435
No, she likes that.

29
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,938
Ha, ha. Yeah, faking sleep
doesn't work either.

30
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,357
I can't tell you how many mornings
I woke up with her-

31
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,026
-Oh.
-Oh, okay.

32
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:54,281
-Ha, ha. Yeah, why am I telling you?
-I don't know. Ha, ha.

33
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,539
Uh, uh....

34
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,125
-It wasn't every morning-
-Oh, making it worse.

35
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,585
Okay.

36
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,763
So I guess you'd like to know
how it all happened.

37
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,474
I mean, well, I think I can figure it out.

38
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,934
I guess, you know, I was born...

39
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,478
...and then everyone
started lying their asses off.

40
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,773
No, no, it wasn't like that.

41
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,443
I mean, remember how I told you
how Lily and Frank and I, we were close?

42
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,363
Well, we were very close.

43
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,989
How close?

44
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,868
Well, the three of us,
we were kind of a, urn- A couple.

45
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,039
-I don't even know how that would work.
-Well, we-

46
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,332
I'm not asking.

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,920
Well, anyhow, somehow I got pregnant...

48
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,630
...and I was...

49
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,592
...scared. I was stupid and selfish and....

50
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,511
I was 18 years old.

51
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,764
I mean, you remember what it was like
to be 18 years old, don't you?

52
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,809
Yeah. Let's see, my mom had killed herself
and my dad had run off.

53
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:49,980
And I was living in a gremlin with a guy
named Cindy, who talked to his hand.

54
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,692
Oh, I'm so sorry.

55
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,611
I thought I was leaving you
with the best parents in the world.

56
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,990
I didn't even hear about your mom and dad
till a couple of years ago.

57
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,075
And by then, you were already grown-up.

58
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,828
I don't know. You're here
and I would really-

59
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,872
I would like to get to know you.

60
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,125
Yeah, well, everybody does. Ha, ha.

61
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,335
I'm a really cool person.

62
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,754
And you know, you had 29 years
to find that out...

63
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,423
...but you didn't even try.

64
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,802
You know what? You walked out on me,
and I'm gonna do the same to you.

65
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,389
-Wait.
-Okay? I don't ever want to see you again.

66
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,103
Where's my purse?

67
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,274
Shoot. We're out of soda.

68
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,193
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.

69
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,279
-Really?
-No, because I'm not your boyfriend.

70
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,533
Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,619
Huh. Well, ahem....

72
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,247
My mom's friend, Phoebe,
is actually my birth mom.

73
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,003
I found a dried-up seahorse.

74
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,380
Sweetie, what are you talking about?

75
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,634
Oh, my new mom,
who's a big fat abandoner.

76
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,052
Oh, wait, Pheebs.

77
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,388
Wait a second. Don't you want to stay here
and talk about it?

78
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,474
No. I just- I wanna-

79
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,643
I need to be alone.

80
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,314
-Monica.
-Oh.

81
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,908
It's over.

82
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,121
-Oh. Was it awful?
-Well, it was long.

83
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,332
I didn't even realize how late it was...

84
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,043
...till I noticed the five o'clock shadow
on her head.

85
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:45,387
Anyway, she didn't want to stay.
I called a cab. She just left.

86
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,646
I wrote you a letter.

87
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,691
Oh, thank you. Ha, ha.

88
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,235
I like mail.

89
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,825
There's just some things
I've been thinking about.

90
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,577
You know, things about us.

91
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,663
And before we can even think
about the two of us getting back together...

92
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,375
...I just need to know
how you feel about this stuff.

93
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,672
-Okay. Hen.
-Okay.

94
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,719
Well, it's....

95
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,054
It's 5:30 in the morning. Heh.

96
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:35,312
So I'd better get cracking on this baby.

97
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,482
So I'll be waiting for you.
Just come up when you're done.

98
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,652
Okay. I'll be up...

99
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,905
...in 18 pages.

100
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,366
Front and back.

101
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,120
Very exciting.

102
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,222
Oh, oh.

103
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:17,979
Hey.

104
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,482
What happened to you?
Why didn't you come up?

105
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,692
Done.

106
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,447
-You just finished?
-Well, I wanted to be thorough.

107
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:33,244
I mean, this is clearly
very, very important to you. To us.

108
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,248
And so I wanted to read
every word carefully.

109
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,458
Twice.

110
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,711
So, um....

111
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,297
Does it?

112
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,972
I'm sorry?

113
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,141
Does it?

114
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,852
Does it?

115
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,771
Does it?

116
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:07,821
Yeah, I wanted to give that whole
"Does it?" part just another glance.

117
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,157
What are you talking about, Ross?
You just said that you read it twice.

118
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,744
Look, you know what? It either does
or doesn't. And if you have to think-

119
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,498
No, Rach.
No, I don't have to think about it. I don't.

120
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,999
Uh, in fact...

121
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,753
...I've decided. I have decided...

122
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,922
...that it...

123
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,512
...does.

124
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,198
-Are you sure?
-Oh, sure, I'm sure.

125
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:03,585
All right. There's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.

126
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,128
Would you go out with me?

127
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,090
Ehh.

128
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,761
I've got canned goods.

129
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,390
Hey, you guys, take a look at this.

130
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,518
Check this baby out. Dug me a hole.

131
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,814
Excellent hole, Joe.

132
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,526
Oh, no, no. My hole.

133
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,820
Ow! My foot. Ow!

134
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,405
What? What is it?

135
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,076
Jellyfish sting.
Ow, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

136
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,286
Well, can we help you,
take you back to the house?

137
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,704
Oh, it's, like, two miles.

138
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,207
Yeah, and I'm a little tired
from digging the hole.

139
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,627
Damn the jellyfish.

140
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,421
Damn all the jellyfish.

141
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,714
We've gotta do something.

142
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,424
There's only one thing you can do.

143
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,717
What? What is it?

144
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,219
You're gonna have to pee on it.

145
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,056
What? Gross.

146
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,475
Don't blame me.
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

147
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:04,646
You know what? He's right.
There's something like ammonia in that...

148
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,356
...that kills the pain.

149
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:10,360
Well, forget it. It doesn't hurt that bad!

150
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,404
If you want some privacy,
you can use my hole.

151
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,453
Well, I'm ready
to get the hell out of here.

152
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,539
Oh.

153
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,748
Are you-?

154
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,375
Are you?

155
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,418
Oh, that's so great.

156
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,878
Ooh, not for Bonnie.

157
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,423
But for you, yay, aah.

158
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,802
-Hey.
-How was the beach?

159
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,221
-Nothing. I don't know.
-Uh, let's not worry about it.

160
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,600
-What happened?
-Nothing.

161
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,311
-I'm gonna take a shower.
-Me too.

162
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,063
Me too.

163
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,732
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.

164
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,902
Oh, I have to go pack. Oh!

165
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,989
-And it really does?
-It does.

166
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,283
It really and truly does.

167
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,868
Oh.

168
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,517
It so does not.

169
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,941
She wants me to take responsibility...

170
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,069
...for everything that went wrong
in our relationship.

171
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:40,325
I mean, she goes on for five pages
about how I was unfaithful to her.

172
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,369
We were on a break!

173
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,665
Oh, my God. If you say that one more time,
I'm gonna break up with you.

174
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,500
All right, fine.

175
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,046
But this breakup was not all my fault.
And she says here:

176
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,716
"If you accept full responsibility-"
Full responsibility.

177
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,843
"-I can begin to trust you again.

178
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,513
Does that seem like something
you can do? Does it?"

179
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,559
No?

180
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,189
Look, Ross, you have what you want.
You're back with Rachel.

181
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,359
You're gonna wreck the best thing
that ever happened to you.

182
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,820
Yeah, I know. I know, you're right.

183
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,448
Yeah, I guess I'll let it go.

184
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:24,035
But you understand how hard it is
to forget about this?

185
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,745
Sure, it's hard to forget...

186
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,123
...but that doesn't mean
you have to talk about it.

187
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,334
A lot of things happened on that trip...

188
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,505
...that we should never, ever talk about.

189
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,218
What the hell happened on that beach?

190
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,889
It's between us and the sea, Ross.

191
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,068
-Hi, Ursula.
-Hey.

192
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,321
Okay, well, um, I know that
we haven't talked in a long time.

193
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,491
But, urn, okay, our mom
is not our birth mom.

194
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,952
This other lady is our birth mom.

195
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,247
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montauk.
Mm-hm.

196
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,790
You know her?

197
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,794
No. I, urn--1 read about her
in Mom's suicide note.

198
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,255
There was a suicide note?

199
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,299
Well, do you still have it?

200
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,884
Hang on.

201
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,307
I can't believe you didn't tell me
there was a suicide note.

202
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,726
Yeah, so how have you been doing?

203
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,103
I.... Shut up.

204
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,444
"Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.
I'll miss you.

205
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,405
P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk."

206
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,782
You just wrote this.

207
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,953
Well, it's pretty much the gist.

208
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,332
Except for the poem.
You read the poem, right?

209
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,168
No.

210
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,754
All right. Hang on.

211
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,886
Pass the cheese, please.

212
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,598
Ugh.

213
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,727
My God, you can't even look at me,
can you?

214
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,354
No.

215
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,149
Yay, it's Phoebe. We can talk to Phoebe.

216
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,445
No, I'm too depressed to talk.

217
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,655
I'll give you $1000 to talk to us.

218
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,033
Hey, you guys...

219
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,119
...what do you think about making
that beach trip an annual thing?

220
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,121
No.

221
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,707
All right, that's it, you guys.
What happened out there?

222
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,252
What? We took a walk.
Nothing happened.

223
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,463
I came back with nothing all over me.

224
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,133
-Come on, what happened? Joey?
-What does that mean?

225
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,260
-All right.
-No.

226
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,471
Joey, we swore we'd never tell.

227
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,807
They'll never understand.

228
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,645
But we have to say something.

229
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,772
We have to get it out.
It's eating me alive.

230
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,195
-Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
-All right.

231
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,741
All right.

232
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,871
I got stung.

233
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,958
Stung bad.

234
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,670
I couldn't stand. I-

235
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,547
I couldn't walk.

236
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,133
We were two miles from the house.

237
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,886
We were scared and alone.

238
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,347
We didn't think we could make it.

239
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,854
I was in too much pain.

240
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,273
And I was tired
from digging the huge hole.

241
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,486
And then Joey remembered something.

242
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,906
I'd seen this thing
on the Discovery Channel.

243
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,658
Wait a minute, I saw that.

244
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:55,371
On the Discovery Channel.
Yeah, about jellyfish and how if you-

245
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,792
Ew.

246
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,502
You peed on yourself?

247
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,504
Ew.

248
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,216
You can't say that. You don't know.

249
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,677
I thought I was gonna pass out
from the pain.

250
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,890
Anyway, I tried, but I couldn't...

251
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,141
...bend that way.

252
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,395
So....

253
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,732
Ew.

254
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,904
That's right. I stepped up.

255
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,075
She's my friend and she needed help.

256
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,037
If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you.

257
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,253
Only, uh, I couldn't.

258
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,842
I got the stage fright.

259
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,096
I wanted to help,
but there was just too much pressure...

260
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,224
...so I, uh- I turned to Chandler.

261
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,441
Joey kept screaming at me,
"Do it now. Do it. Do it. Do it now."

262
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:10,112
Sometimes, late at night,
I can still hear the screaming.

263
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,619
That's because, sometimes, I just do it
through my wall to freak you out.

264
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,958
<i>And fuchsia and mauve</i>

265
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:26,629
<i>Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom</i>

266
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,090
Thank you. Thank you.

267
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:33,886
Oh, and I invite all of you
to count the colors in your bedroom.

268
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,265
Except for you. You go away.

269
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,229
I'll go in a second.

270
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,481
I just want to tell you...

271
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,443
...that there hasn't been a day
when I didn't regret giving you up.

272
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,779
Okay, bye.

273
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,615
No, I'm not done.

274
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,244
I just want you to know, the reason
I never looked you up was because...

275
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,496
...well, I was afraid that you'd react...

276
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,083
...just, well, like the way
you're reacting now.

277
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,545
Can't we just, you know, start from here?
Please?

278
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,673
No.

279
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,428
Okay.

280
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,680
Sorry.

281
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,309
But just one last thing.

282
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,187
You know, you came looking for family.

283
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,190
I'm family.

284
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,985
I'm it.

285
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,615
Well, now I'm done.

286
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:42,121
Yeah, but it's not like
we're losing anything, you know?

287
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,333
Yeah, I guess you're right.

288
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,920
It's not like we know each other or anything
or that have anything in common.

289
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:55,384
Oh, I don't know. I mean, it's not like
we don't have anything in common.

290
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,221
I mean, I like, uh, pizza.

291
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,682
I— I like pizza.

292
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,601
You do?

293
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,187
Wait, I like, um, the Beatles.

294
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,855
Oh, my God. So do I!

295
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,066
I knew it. Wow.

296
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,109
Wait, wait, wait. Puppies. Cute or ugly?

297
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,320
-Oh, so cute.
-Oh!

298
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,156
-Well? Ha, ha.
-You see?

299
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,867
But I'm still- I'm mad at you.

300
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,660
I know.

301
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,580
I'm mad at me too.

302
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,584
Well, um, do you want to get
something to eat?

303
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,586
Because I'm kind of hungry.

304
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,546
Hey. Me too.

305
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,966
All right, stop it. Now you're just
doing it to freak me out.

306
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,141
Aw, I missed you.

307
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,394
I missed you too.

308
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,274
Oh, I was so nervous about that letter.

309
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,279
But the way you
owned up to everything...

310
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:02,243
...it just showed me
how much you've grown, you know?

311
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,955
I suppose.

312
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:11,210
No. You have, Ross. You have.
You should give yourself credit.

313
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,713
I mean, my mom never thought
this would work out.

314
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,717
Heh. She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

315
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,556
-Mm-hm.
-Oh.

316
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,642
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.

317
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:32,440
But if time was what you needed
just to gain a little perspective....

318
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,485
We were on a break!

319
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,947
-Coffeehouse?
-You bet.

320
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:44,535
And for the record, it took two people
to break up this relationship.

321
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,829
Yeah, you and that girl
from the copy place...

322
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,582
...which yesterday
you took full responsibility for.

323
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,668
I didn't know what I was taking
responsibility for, okay?

324
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,628
I didn't finish the whole letter.

325
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,797
-What?
-I fell asleep.

326
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,175
You fell asleep?

327
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,928
Yeah, it was 5:30 in the morning.

328
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:08,517
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

329
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,395
Front and back!

330
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,440
Oh, oh, oh. And by the way.

331
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,194
"Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E" means "you are."

332
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,112
"Y-O-U-R" means "your."

333
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,325
I can't believe I even thought
of getting back together with you.

334
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,076
We are so over.

335
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,246
Fine by me!

336
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,790
Oh, and hey, hey, hey.

337
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,169
Those spelling tips will come in handy
when you're at home on Saturday nights...

338
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,796
...playing Scrabble with Monica.

339
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,006
-Hey.
-Sorry.

340
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:43,427
I just feel bad about all that sleep you're
gonna miss, wishing you were with me.

341
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,013
Oh, no, no.
Don't you worry about me falling asleep.

342
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,766
I still have your letter!

343
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,729
And hey, just so you know,
it's not that common.

344
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:57,817
It doesn't happen to every guy
and it is a big deal!

345
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,819
I knew it!

346
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,284
Gin.

347
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,246
We were playing gin?

348
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,251
You know, if we were a couple,
we could play this game naked.

349
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,087
-Ha, ha. Would you stop?
-Okay.

350
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,755
All right.

351
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,259
Okay, all right. I think you're great.

352
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,637
I think you're sweet and you're smart...

353
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:27,888
...and I love you.

354
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,685
But you will always be the guy
who peed on me.
