1
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:09,593
Oh, man.

2
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,555
-What is that?
-Treeger's snaking the shower drain.

3
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:18,227
What in the name of hell?

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,939
Maybe he found your flip-flop.

5
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,610
-Hey.
-Whoa.

6
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,445
Is this porn?

7
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,032
What did I do? I must have
hit something on the remote.

8
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,617
Do we pay for this?

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,246
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill.

10
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,748
Maybe this is how they punish us.

11
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:43,669
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill.
Free phone sex.

12
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:47,130
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.

13
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,719
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.

14
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:57,349
Yeah, Joey just pressed something
on the remote and it just came on.

15
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,979
It happened to me once. I was flipping
through the channels and, bam.

16
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,149
-It was like finding money.
-Finding money with naked people on it.

17
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,486
Then I made the mistake
of turning off the TV.

18
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,989
I never got it back again.

19
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,282
And I'm sad.

20
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,914
Why would he turn off the TV?

21
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,553
All right, you know what? Do we really
have to watch this while we eat?

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,513
No, no, no.

23
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,309
We don't know
what could make this go away.

24
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:27,230
Yeah, so no one touches the remote,
and no one touches the TV.

25
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,567
And no one touches the air
around the TV.

26
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:36,573
Imagine a protective porn bubble,
if you will.

27
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,535
-I'm at least going to mute it.
-No, no, no.

28
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,750
-We still have porn.
-Yeah.

29
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,212
-Hi.
-Hey.

30
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,505
Honey, what are you doing?

31
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,091
-That's too heavy. Give it here.
-Yeah.

32
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,260
Oh, God.

33
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,304
Okay.

34
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,639
Ugh.

35
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:05,310
I'm getting too pregnant for this—
Lugging around a stupid massage table.

36
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,813
I have to find a job
where I carry a smaller table.

37
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,940
Or a job where you don't
have to carry a table.

38
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,025
You mean, like a doctor?

39
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,696
Pheebs, you're blocking the porn.
Look out.

40
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,197
Oh!

41
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,949
Oh, my.

42
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,619
Oh, that reminds me.
I have to see my ob-gyn today.

43
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,960
-Hi.
-Hi.

44
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,671
So, uh, Emily just went to the airport.

45
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,548
Aw. Why didn't you take her?

46
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,466
Ehh, her uncle had planned on doing it.

47
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,303
And you know, we said
our goodbyes this morning, so....

48
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,433
You must feel horrible.
Hey, the guys have free porn.

49
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,562
No.

50
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,731
Hey, cheer up.
You're gonna see her again, right?

51
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,609
Well, that's the thing. I don't know.

52
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,028
I mean, whenever I brought it up with her,
she said:

53
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,615
"This is so fantastic. Why do we
have to talk about the future?

54
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,160
-Let's enjoy-"
-Don't do the accent.

55
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,872
You've got to see her again.

56
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,665
Why do you care?

57
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,167
Because.

58
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,544
You could get to live out my fantasy.

59
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,172
You've had fantasies about Emily?

60
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,676
No. You know, the fantasy.

61
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,511
Meet someone from a strange land...

62
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,306
...fall madly in love
and spend the rest of your lives together.

63
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,391
Is that why, in junior high...

64
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,603
...you were the only one who hung out
with that Ukrainian kid?

65
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:35,442
Yeah, that, but plus his mom used to put
sour cream on everything.

66
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,069
Do you love her?

67
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,365
We said it was only gonna be
two weeks, you know?

68
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,202
You love her.

69
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,371
What is love, really?

70
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,832
I knew you loved her.

71
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,335
You need to go to the airport
and tell her.

72
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,379
You're probably gonna catch her
just as she's about to go to the gate.

73
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,549
You're gonna call out her name
and yell, "I love you."

74
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,968
She's gonna say, "I love you too."

75
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,263
Then you guys are gonna have
the most amazing kiss.

76
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,766
Everyone at the gate will applaud.

77
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,852
I am a good kisser.

78
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,066
Then you two can sneak into the cockpit.

79
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,402
Things will start to heat up.

80
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,239
And then a stewardess comes in....

81
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,909
I've been watching too much porn.

82
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,832
-Is that the heartbeat?
-That's it.

83
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,168
Oh, my God.

84
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,212
Oh, wow. This is so cool.

85
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,550
Have we talked about the possibility
of multiple births?

86
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,386
Why don't we just take care of this one?

87
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,430
And should I get pregnant again,
I'll hold onto your card, okay?

88
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,519
No, I'm getting three
separate heartbeats.

89
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,231
Three? You guys were worried
I wouldn't even have one.

90
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,151
-Doctors are wrong all the time.
-Well....

91
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,155
Well, so are you sure
that there are three?

92
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,908
-Definitely.
-Oh, my God.

93
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,496
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Ha, ha.

94
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,790
So in a few months...

95
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,210
...I'm gonna have three full-grown babies
just walking around inside me?

96
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,423
Oh, oh. And it's gonna be like
one of those log rides...

97
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,134
...when they just come shooting out.

98
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,597
Giving birth to three babies is not
that different than giving birth to one.

99
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,348
What do you know?

100
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,316
-Phoebe.
-Oh! Hi.

101
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,236
So how'd it go at the doctor's?

102
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,905
Oh, well, okay. Hey.

103
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,991
You know how, when you're,
um, walking down the street...

104
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,952
...and you see three people in a row.

105
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,164
And you say "Oh, that's nice."

106
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,501
-Yes.
-Okay.

107
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:03,006
Yeah, well, good news.
You're gonna have three babies. Aah!

108
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,384
-Three babies?
-Uh-huh.

109
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,595
Oh, oh!

110
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,264
I've finally got my band.

111
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:16,353
We're gonna have a big family!
I always wanted a big family!

112
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:21,942
Oh, God. I'm so glad you guys are happy.
I was so afraid you we're gonna be freaked.

113
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,694
-Oh.
-Why would we be freaked?

114
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,074
No, because maybe it's harder to raise them
and the added expense. Ugh!

115
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,037
-Oh.
-Right.

116
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,916
No, back to happy. Back to happy!

117
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,920
No, no, no. It's gonna be fine...

118
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,546
...because, urn....

119
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,548
Because I teach Home Ec.

120
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:50,428
And I can have 30 kids making
baby clothes all year long.

121
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:55,183
You know, it'll be like
my very own little sweatshop.

122
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,895
You know, I've been thinking...

123
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,231
...ever since you said
that we're gonna have triplets.

124
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:08,071
The best thing for me to do is
drop out of college and get a job.

125
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,949
-Frank.
-No, you can't quit college. No.

126
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,450
You're in college? Really?

127
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,495
-Yeah, refrigerator college.
-Yeah.

128
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,916
Yeah, you know, when we found out
we were gonna have a baby...

129
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:24,963
...I figured, you know,
I should have, like, a career, you know?

130
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,965
-And I love refrigerators.
-Yeah.

131
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,593
You can't give up on your dream. Ugh.

132
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,723
No, it's okay.
We're gonna have three kids.

133
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,101
And that's a different kind of dream.

134
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,019
Three kids and no money.

135
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,779
<i>This is the boarding call for Flight 009.</i>

136
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,781
Emily.

137
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,616
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

138
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,787
I just- I had to see you one more time
before you took off.

139
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,957
You are so sweet.

140
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,754
That's a big candy bar.

141
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,884
I had the most amazing time with you.

142
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,803
Me too.

143
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,640
<i>This is the final boarding call
for Flight 009.</i>

144
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,977
Well, that's me.

145
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,320
Here, have this.

146
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,489
I'm only allowed one piece
of carry-on anyway.

147
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,161
Wait, uh....

148
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,956
Listen, I have to tell you something.

149
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,042
I've been thinking.

150
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,837
I'm just going to come out and say it, okay?
Uh....

151
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,256
I think...

152
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,675
...I love you.

153
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,013
Oh.

154
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,354
Thank you.

155
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,781
It's no problem.

156
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,208
What is that song
that has been in my head all day?

157
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,044
It's the theme from <i>Good Will Humping.</i>

158
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,883
You know who doesn't even like
dirty movies?

159
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,387
-My new boyfriend Joshua.
-Yeah, right.

160
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,934
No, he told me he prefers to leave
certain things to the imagination.

161
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,771
Oh, oh, yeah. Did he also say that he
thought some of the dialogue was corny?

162
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,315
And that he actually found it funny,
not sexy?

163
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,733
Yes.

164
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,404
Yeah, he likes porn.

165
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,491
Where you going?

166
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,953
I'm gonna find out if he really thinks
supermodels are too skinny.

167
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,122
-Hey, Pheebs.
-Hi.

168
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,749
-Hi. Hey.
-How'd it go with Frank and Alice?

169
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,418
Frank has to quit college...

170
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,213
...because his super-fertile sister
is having three babies. Ugh.

171
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,632
I need to make a lot of money really fast.

172
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,093
And I had an idea
that I wanted to talk to you about...

173
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,262
...because you work for a big company.
Okay.

174
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,597
Insider trading.

175
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,809
What information is there
that you can give me?

176
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,604
Well, actually, they don't really talk to us
about that stuff.

177
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,772
I can get you some free White-Out,
though.

178
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,361
Huh! Did you do what I said?
Did you tell her?

179
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,405
-I did.
-And what did she say?

180
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,073
"Thank you."

181
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,661
You're totally welcome. What'd she say?

182
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,624
She said, "Thank you."

183
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,251
I said, "I love you."

184
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,463
And she said, "Thank you."

185
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,759
Oh, wait. Did you say you love her?

186
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,803
Yeah, what were you trying
to get her to do?

187
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,806
What do I do now?

188
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,226
You play hard-to-get.

189
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,646
She already lives in London.

190
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,191
So you go to Tokyo.

191
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,985
All right, look, forget it.

192
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,030
Okay, forget it.
You told her you love her. It's over.

193
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,283
It is not over. You're over.

194
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,994
What?

195
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,665
You know.

196
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,460
Okay.

197
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,338
Good one.

198
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,176
It's not over because she's gonna call you
and tell you she loves you.

199
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,805
The reason why she couldn't is because her
feelings were so strong that it scared her.

200
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,057
Now, you go home
and you wait for her call.

201
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,685
She could be calling you from the plane.
Come on, go.

202
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:53,106
Okay, okay. But if she doesn't call,
it is definitely over.

203
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,986
No, wait, wait. Unless, eventually, I call her,
you know, to see what's going on...

204
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:02,532
...and she says she'll call me back,
but then she doesn't.

205
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,618
Then it's over.

206
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,745
Way to be strong, man.

207
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,090
-Hi.
-Hey.

208
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,342
Listen, can we watch cartoons
on your television?

209
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,012
We need a porn break.

210
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:28,141
We spent the last two hours watching
<i>In and Out and In Again.</i>

211
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,978
Well, so why don't you just turn it off?

212
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,023
Because then we'd be the guys
who turned off free porn.

213
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,735
Oh, good, you're here.

214
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,944
Hey.

215
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,404
What you got there?

216
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,574
Oh, this? Well, I'm glad you asked.

217
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,204
Now, don't you hate it
when you have to cut a tin can...

218
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,707
...with an ordinary steak knife?

219
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,044
Ha.

220
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,962
Now, I know what you're thinking.

221
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,006
Pregnant woman slays four?

222
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,385
They didn't make you pay
for those knives, did they?

223
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,095
-No.
-Are you sure?

224
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,014
No.

225
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:12,101
You're not gonna make enough money
to help Frank and Alice by selling knives.

226
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,352
No, no. I know that.

227
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,481
But I just need to make enough money
for the second part of my plan.

228
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:20,068
-What's the second part of your plan?
-My Saturn dealership.

229
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,453
Hello?

230
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,330
Ross?

231
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,332
Emily. Hi.

232
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,544
Uh, how was your flight?

233
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,004
<i>It was dreadful.</i>

234
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:44,634
Uh, I felt terrible about how I acted
when you said those wonderful things.

235
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,554
No, no, that's all right. Urn....

236
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,140
I'm just glad you called.

237
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,811
<i>Ross, urn, there's something
that I've got to tell you.</i>

238
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,065
There's someone else.

239
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,657
Does that mean the same thing
in England as it does in America?

240
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,245
She doesn't know
which one of us she wants.

241
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,330
Me or this "Colin" guy.

242
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:18,000
This isn't how it was supposed to go.
I mean, there can't be another guy.

243
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,669
Well....

244
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,713
Of course there's another guy.

245
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,924
Heh. This is even more perfect.

246
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,344
Now you have to prove your love.

247
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,682
I'm not proving anything, okay?
I'm done listening to you.

248
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,893
If I hadn't let you talk me
into going to the airport in the first place...

249
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,937
...I wouldn't have put my fist
through the wall.

250
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,689
You put your fist through the wall?

251
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,233
No, I missed and hit the door.

252
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,528
But it opened really hard.

253
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,532
-You have to go to London.
-What?

254
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,367
Yep. You have to go fight for her.

255
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,369
Oh, yeah, sure. That makes sense.

256
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,581
Because you already told her you loved her,
and she didn't say it back.

257
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,125
Then she called you and told you
there was another guy.

258
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,210
So yeah. Go to London.
That will scare her.

259
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,465
When Rachel was with Paolo,
what did you do?

260
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,593
I made fun of his accent.

261
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,472
You sat back and let him have her.
You didn't fight at all. Am I right?

262
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,932
You want the same thing
to happen with Emily?

263
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,225
-No.
-All right, then.

264
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,061
Go fight for her. Go to London.

265
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,731
I mean, that could be you and Emily.

266
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,986
That, but nicer.

267
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,571
Just go to London.

268
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,282
-Really?
-Come on.

269
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:35,328
Surprise her. Show up at her doorstep.
Don't let her go without a fight.

270
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,582
-All right. All right. I'm going to do it.
-All right.

271
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,044
I'm gonna go to London,
and I am gonna fight for her.

272
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,962
Okay. Good luck.

273
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,341
Ross, Ross. If you're going to the airport...

274
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,510
...can you pick me up another one
of those Toblerone bars?

275
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,772
Oh, oh, I did it. I did it.
I figured out a way to make money.

276
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:06,067
I'm gonna open up my own massage place
and Frank's gonna help me.

277
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,403
And we can work it around his schedule,
so he doesn't have to quit school.

278
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,030
La-la-la.

279
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,367
That sounds great.
But how can you afford it?

280
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,035
We were walking down the street...

281
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,037
...and we saw that van
you used for catering.

282
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,623
-And we realized-
-I'm telling it. I'm telling it.

283
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,502
Okay, you know how people
need transportation...

284
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,921
...but they also need massages to relax?

285
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:31,717
So I just figured we could combine the two.
Okay, I give the massages and Frank drives.

286
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,721
I can fix up the van, bolt the table
in the back and you know what I've got?

287
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,849
A place that no one
will ever get out of alive?

288
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:45,314
No, think about it. It's a taxi that
people take when they need to relax.

289
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,525
It's a Relaxi-Taxi.

290
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,612
The name was my favorite part.

291
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,283
-Well, I came up with it.
-You did not!

292
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,076
Oh!

293
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:02,456
No. You came up with Relaxi-Cab.
That's not good.

294
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,545
-Hello?
-<i>Hey.</i>

295
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,215
Oh, my God. Ross, are you in England?
Was Emily surprised?

296
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,426
No, because she hasn't come home yet.

297
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,636
And she hasn't been home all night.

298
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,389
She's obviously staying
with that other guy.

299
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:22,143
And I'm the stupid moron who spent
the whole night outside her apartment.

300
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,353
All right, when is the next flight out?

301
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,813
About four hours.

302
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,692
<i>Okay, just stay there a couple more hours.
If she doesn't show up, come home.</i>

303
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,902
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.

304
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,406
And ask him if he thinks that is better
than Relaxi-Cab.

305
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,703
It's not Relaxi-Cab.
It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.

306
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,247
Ooh, that is better.

307
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,882
Are we in London?

308
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,010
Why are you doing here?
You can't be here.

309
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,262
I've come to talk to Ross.

310
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,184
What?

311
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,730
Nothing. No, nothing.

312
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,732
I was gonna call him-

313
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,902
Oh, you came to tell him you love him.
I knew it!

314
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,404
I was right! I'm right, right?

315
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:17,990
I'd really rather talk to him.

316
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,620
I've been to his apartment
and he's not there.

317
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,622
And I need to talk to him.

318
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,333
So do you have any idea where he is?

319
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,178
<i>Ross, are you there?</i>

320
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:46,477
<i>Ross, I don't know if you can hear this,
but I'm gonna talk anyway.</i>

321
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,855
I'm in the States
with your sister and your friends.

322
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,316
And it's all over with Colin.

323
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,196
<i>I came here to tell you that
and to tell you-</i>

324
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,533
<i>Yes, Joey, you can have
all the chocolate you want. Just take it.</i>

325
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:08,374
I came here to tell you that I love you.

326
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,668
I love you too.

327
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,422
I'm gonna call you right now
from the phone booth.

328
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,716
You can't hear me.

329
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,636
I wish I could know
if you'd heard any of that.

330
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:24,223
I suppose I've either told you that I love you
or given my neighbors a good laugh.

331
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,728
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening,
bugger off. This is none of your business.

332
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,440
Suppose there's not much chance
you did hear that.

333
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,817
And there's the call waiting...

334
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:38,195
...so I should go.

335
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,698
Oh, well.

336
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,368
Hello?

337
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,328
<i>Hi.</i>

338
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,958
Ross, I love you.

339
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,752
Oh.

340
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,297
Thank you.

341
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,432
-Hey.
-Hey.

342
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,186
I was just at the bank and there
was this really hot teller.

343
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:14,440
And she didn't ask me
to go do it with her in the vault.

344
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,067
Same kind of thing happened to me.

345
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,111
Woman pizza delivery guy comes over...

346
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,822
...gives me the pizza,
takes the money and leaves.

347
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,326
What, no "Nice apartment,
bet the bedrooms are huge"?

348
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,453
No, nothing.

349
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,457
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.

350
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,959
I think you're right.

351
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,171
All right, ready?

352
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,672
-One.
-Two.

353
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,257
-Three.
-Three.

354
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,846
That's kind of nice.

355
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,308
-Yeah, that's kind of a relief.
-Yeah.

356
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,067
-You want to see if we still have it?
-Yeah.

357
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,488
Free porn! We have free porn!
