1
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,308
What the hell is that?

2
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,022
What the hell is that? Is that you?

3
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:32,282
-Boy, you're really not a morning person.
-Just back off!

4
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,538
Get up! Get up! Get up!

5
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,711
What is that noise?

6
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,255
You.

7
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,967
It's the chick.

8
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,220
She's going through some changes.

9
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,806
What kind of changes?

10
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,726
Well, the vet seems to think
that she's becoming a rooster.

11
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,232
We're getting a second opinion.

12
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,369
Hey, what are you doing shopping
at 8 in the morning?

13
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,746
Well, I've been up since 6...

14
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,874
...thanks to somebody's
dumb-ass rooster.

15
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,210
You guys,
you really should get rid of those animals.

16
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,795
They shouldn't be in an apartment.

17
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,299
Yeah, especially not with all these
knives and cookbooks around.

18
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:18,013
All right, I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor
and, uh, see if I'm ready...

19
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,183
...to have Frank and Alice's embryo
transferred into my uterus.

20
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,853
Now, how will they know if you're ready?

21
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,398
Oh, they're just gonna look and see
if my endometrial layer is thick.

22
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,068
Oh, I can check that for you.

23
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,320
Okay, everyone, think "thick."

24
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,405
Good luck.

25
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,658
-Hey. Wish me luck.
-Hey.

26
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,868
-Oh, good luck.
-Good luck.

27
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,330
-And I'm still right.
-That is so not true.

28
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,748
What?

29
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,250
She's mad because I know
today's her laundry day...

30
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,128
...and that means she's wearing
her old-lady underpants.

31
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,341
I can check that for you.

32
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,595
I just can't believe that you think that you
and Chandler know me and Rachel...

33
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,846
...better than we know you.

34
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,058
Well, we do.

35
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,478
You can only eat Tic Tacs
in even numbers.

36
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,605
Yeah, what's that about?

37
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,192
And you. Ross,
I believe if you check Rachel's bag...

38
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,237
...you will find a half-eaten box
of cookies in there.

39
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,159
You're good.

40
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,204
These are not.

41
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,666
I'm so not impressed.
Everybody snacks when they shop.

42
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,875
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah?

43
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,336
Ross, how many items left in that bag?

44
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,213
-Five.
-Okay.

45
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,009
Ten bucks says that we can name
every item in that bag.

46
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,762
-How many guesses do you get?
-Six.

47
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,556
Challenge extended.

48
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,853
-Deal.
-Challenge accepted.

49
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,897
All right, we'll start with...

50
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,732
...apples.

51
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,986
We'll be starting with apples.

52
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,031
Stop that now.

53
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,076
Yes.

54
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,495
Okay. Uh, tortilla chips.

55
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,205
-Yogurt.
-Diet soda.

56
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,958
Yes, yes, yes.

57
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,171
-Orange juice.
-No, there's no orange juice in there.

58
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,714
-We win.
-Ha, ha.

59
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,591
They have another guess.

60
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,719
Okay, well, we won that one.

61
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,555
Okay. The last thing is—

62
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,807
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

63
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,562
No, no. Not for, like, another two weeks.

64
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,777
I got it. Scotch...

65
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,445
...tape.

66
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,452
How did you know
she would buy Scotch tape?

67
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,829
Well, we used up theirs last night
making scary faces.

68
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,500
Oh, man.

69
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,544
All right. Ten bucks. Fork it over.

70
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,881
Cough it up. Pay the piper.

71
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,758
Give me it.

72
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,386
That does not mean you know us better.
I want a rematch.

73
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:07,057
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery
questions. Real personal questions.

74
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,559
Yeah. And the winner gets 100 bucks.

75
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,686
Serious?

76
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,647
Are you scared?

77
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,525
No.

78
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,903
Okay, who makes up the questions?

79
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,571
Ross will do it.

80
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,241
Oh, sure, Ross will do it.

81
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:28,328
It's not like he has a job
or a child or a life of his own.

82
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,372
Well, fine. We'll ask Phoebe.

83
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,831
No, no, no, I wanna play.

84
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,423
Looks like your uterus
is ready for implantation.

85
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,301
Oh, I knew it. I knew it.
I felt really thick this morning.

86
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,887
-Ha, ha.
-Okay, so, what's now?

87
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,515
Go get the eggs. Put them in there.

88
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,435
Okay. It'll take just a little while
to prepare the embryos.

89
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,231
-Embryos? As in more than one?
-Mm-hm. Five, actually.

90
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,692
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth...

91
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,861
...in a hospital
or a big box under the stairs?

92
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,614
Ha, ha. We do five because
that gives you a 25-percent chance...

93
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,533
...that at least one will attach.

94
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,618
That's it? Twenty-five percent?

95
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,539
That means that it's, like,
75-percent chance of no baby at all?

96
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,749
Yeah, you know, I was thinking,
what are the odds...

97
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,711
...if, like, you stuff, like,
200 of them in there?

98
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,881
Sweetie, now...

99
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,924
...she's a woman,
not a gumball machine.

100
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,179
Okay, well, you know what? Don't worry.

101
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,349
I'm gonna do this as many times
as it takes to get it right.

102
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:35,729
Well, see, the thing is,
we kind of only have one shot.

103
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,316
Um, it costs $16,000
each time you do this.

104
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,071
So, um, we're kind of using all the money
we have to do it just this one time.

105
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,907
Whoa.

106
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,536
That's- Okay, that's a lot of pressure
on me and my uterus.

107
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,788
So- Well, okay.

108
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:58,084
So maybe there's something that I can do,
you know, just to make sure I get pregnant.

109
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,669
No, I'm sorry.

110
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,589
Wow, you guys
really don't know anything.

111
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,592
I know. Why doesn't she get drunk?

112
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,678
That worked for a bunch of girls
in my high school.

113
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,062
Hey, guys. Do you realize
that any minute now...

114
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,688
...Phoebe could be pregnant?

115
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,856
I know, I know.

116
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:24,361
-It's such a huge, life-altering thing.
-I know.

117
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,238
The test is ready.

118
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,663
Okay. Each team will answer
10 questions.

119
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,458
The first team to answer
the most questions wins.

120
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,170
The categories are
"Fears And Pet Peeves"...

121
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,339
..."Ancient History"...

122
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,007
..."Literature"...

123
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,426
...and "It's All Relative."

124
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:55,308
Now, the coin toss,
to see who goes first.

125
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,692
Okay.

126
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,736
-Somebody call it this time.
-Yeah.

127
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,822
Tails.

128
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,408
-It's heads.
-Yeah!

129
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,995
Gentlemen, pick your category.

130
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,080
"Fears And Pet Peeves."

131
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,167
"What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?"

132
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,294
-Animals dressed as humans.
-That's correct.

133
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,466
-Ladies?
-Same category.

134
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,926
Okay.

135
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,848
"According to Chandler, what phenomenon
scares the bejesus out of him?"

136
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,977
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.

137
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,479
That is correct.

138
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,526
The Irish jig guy?

139
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,864
His legs flail about
as if independent from his body.

140
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,825
Gentlemen, your pick.

141
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,410
"It's All Relative."

142
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,913
"Monica and I had
a grandmother who died.

143
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,207
You both went to her funeral.

144
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,917
Name that grandmother."

145
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,466
-Nana?
-She has a real name.

146
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,176
-Althea.
-Althea?

147
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,677
-What are you doing?
-Took a shot.

148
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:13,887
Shooting with Althea?

149
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,598
-Althea is correct.
-Nice shooting.

150
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,478
We'll take "Literature."

151
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:26,775
"Every week, the <i>TV Guide </i>comes
to Chandler and Joey's apartment.

152
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,070
What name appears
on the address label?"

153
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,530
Oh! Chandler gets it. It's Chandler Bing.

154
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,740
No.

155
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:38,078
I'm afraid the <i>TV Guide
</i>comes to "Chanandler Bong."

156
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,624
I knew that.

157
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,793
Rachel, use your head.

158
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,963
Actually, it's Miss Chanandler Bong.

159
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,890
Hello, teeny embryos.

160
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,852
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. Hi.

161
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,274
I'm hoping to be your uterus
for the next nine months.

162
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,736
You should know that
we're doing this for Frank and Alice...

163
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,155
...who you know. You've been there.

164
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,699
Urn....

165
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,244
You know, they want you so much.

166
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,872
So when you guys get in there,
really grab on.

167
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:27,043
Okay, and I promise that I'll keep you
safe and warm...

168
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,547
...until, you know, you're ready
to have them take you home.

169
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,174
So....

170
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,801
Okay.

171
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,972
Oh, and also, next time you see me,
if I'm screaming, don't worry.

172
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,558
That's what's supposed to happen.

173
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,270
-Ready?
-Uh-huh?

174
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,564
Good luck.

175
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,902
All right, the score is nine to eight
in favor of the guys.

176
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,656
Ladies, if you miss this,
the game is theirs. Pick your category.

177
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,741
"It's All Relative"!

178
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,413
-You don't have to shout everything.
-I'm sorry!

179
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:10,211
Ooh. "What is the name
of Chandler's father's...

180
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,214
...Las Vegas all-male burlesque?"

181
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,634
<i>Viva Las Gaygas.</i>

182
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,680
Unfortunately, that is correct.

183
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,515
Yes.

184
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,351
All right. We have a tie.

185
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,689
Luckily, I've prepared
for such an event.

186
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,693
-The Lightning Round.
-Ooh.

187
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,490
Thirty seconds.
All the questions you can answer.

188
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,534
You guys are dead.

189
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,162
I am so good at Lightning Rounds.

190
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,666
I majored in Lightning Rounds,
all right?

191
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,210
-We're gonna destroy you.
-Want to bet?

192
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,089
Oh, I'm so confused as to what
we've been doing so far.

193
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,802
How about we play for more money?
Say 150?

194
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,680
One hundred and fifty dollars.

195
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,017
Say 200?

196
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,811
Two hundred dollars.

197
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,480
You're doing it again.

198
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,315
Excuse me.

199
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,318
-Monica, I don't want to lose $200.
-We won't.

200
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,694
-Okay.
-Three hundred?

201
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,239
-Monica.
-I'm just trying to spice it up.

202
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,993
Okay, so then play for some pepper.
Stop spending my money.

203
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,579
I got it.

204
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,083
How about if we win,
they have to get rid of the rooster.

205
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,085
Ooh, that's interesting.

206
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,337
Hey, no way. That rooster's family.

207
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,798
-Throw in the duck too.
-What do you have against the duck?

208
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,009
-It doesn't make noise.
-Well, he gets the other one all riled up.

209
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,304
-Look, we are not-
-All right, hold on.

210
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,724
If you win...

211
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,935
-...we give up the bird.
-Aah!

212
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,356
But if we win...

213
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,692
...we get your apartment.

214
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,777
Ooh!

215
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,779
Deal!

216
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,495
Monica, betting the apartment?
I don't know about this.

217
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,248
Rachel, I have not missed
one question the whole game.

218
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,666
I own this game.

219
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,042
Look at my hand.

220
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,253
Why, do you have the answers
written on there?

221
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,841
No. Steady as a rock.
Now, are you with me?

222
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,678
-All right, let's do it. Okay.
-Come on.

223
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,055
All right. Gentlemen, you're up first.

224
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,265
Okay.

225
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,726
You have 30 seconds.

226
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,062
The Lightning Round begins-

227
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,689
Stop it.

228
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,652
Now. "What was Monica's nickname
when she was a field-hockey goalie?"

229
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,779
-Big Fat Goalie.
-Correct.

230
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,784
"Rachel claims
this is her favorite movie."

231
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,369
<i>-Dangerous Liaisons.
</i>-Correct.

232
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,205
-"Her actual favorite is...?" Correct.
<i>-Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

233
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,628
"In what part of her body did Monica
get a pencil stuck at age 14?"

234
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,088
Oh!

235
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,925
Ew, no!

236
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,346
Her ear.

237
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:13,728
All right, "Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"

238
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,271
-Okay, everyday use.
-Fancy.

239
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,856
-Guest.
-Fancy guest.

240
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,983
-Two seconds.
-Uh, eleven?

241
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,361
Eleven. Unbelievable.
Eleven is correct.

242
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,780
Yes!

243
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,408
All right.

244
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,869
That's four for the guys.
Ladies, you're up.

245
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,829
All right, all right, come on!

246
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,877
Thirty seconds on the clock.

247
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,546
Five correct questions wins the game.

248
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,384
The Lightning Round begins now.
"What is Joey's favorite food?"

249
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,010
-Sandwiches.
-Correct.

250
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,721
"Chandler was how old
when he first touched a girl's breast?"

251
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,223
-Fourteen?
-No, 19.

252
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,766
Thanks, man.

253
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,602
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.

254
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,396
-His name was..."
-Maurice.

255
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,147
-"His profession was...?"
-Space cowboy.

256
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,607
Correct.

257
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,152
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

258
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,739
Oh.

259
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,659
Oh, gosh.
It has something to do with numbers.

260
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,869
-And processing.
-And he carries a briefcase.

261
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,455
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose the game.

262
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,541
It has something to do
with transponding.

263
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,794
Oh! Oh! He's a transponster.

264
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,548
That's not even a word!

265
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,718
I can get this. I can get this.

266
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,763
No!

267
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,140
Yes!

268
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:48,030
-I call Monica's room.
-You can't just call Monica's room.

269
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,951
Sure I can. Standard Shotgun Rules.
I'm in sight of the room and I called it.

270
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,705
<i>Damn.</i>

271
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,958
Man, I feel like I'm coming down
with something.

272
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,043
-Oh.
-Yeah.

273
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,088
Bet you can't guess what color
my tonsils are. I bet the apartment.

274
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,841
Oh, I would never bet this apartment.
It's too nice.

275
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,637
-Hey.
-Ooh, Pheebs, are they in there?

276
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,639
Um, yeah, uh-huh, I'm implanted.

277
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,393
-How do you feel?
-Well, freaked.

278
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,355
Because it turns out the odds
are, like, really sucky.

279
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,233
And this is Frank and Alice's,
like, only shot.

280
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,820
I mean, they are, like, literally putting
all their eggs in my basket.

281
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,157
Yeah, but I bet it works.

282
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,576
Really? How much?

283
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,164
All right, I'm gonna go take
a pregnancy test right now.

284
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,249
Oh, wow. You can tell this soon?

285
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,543
Well, the doctor says
it takes a couple days.

286
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,006
But, I mean, my body's always been
a little faster than Western medicine, so....

287
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,347
Oh, my God. I can't believe you guys
actually think you're moving in here.

288
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,933
Well, believe it, baby.

289
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,727
Well, I'm not moving.

290
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,187
What?

291
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:05,399
No. It was a stupid bet.
We were just playing a game.

292
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,944
You just can't ignore the bet. It's a bet.

293
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,655
You bet on a bet, and if you lose,
you lose the bet.

294
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,282
Rach, we have to move.

295
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,868
If we had lost, we would have
made them get rid of the birds.

296
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,996
No.

297
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,919
All right, look, I hate this as much as you,
but if it makes you feel better...

298
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,213
...this is all your fault.

299
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,092
-What?
-Chanandler Bong.

300
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,386
Come on, we steal that <i>TV Guide
</i>every week.

301
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,471
I knew it.

302
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,849
I don't care. I'm not going anywhere.

303
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,269
Cool. Girl roommate.

304
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,440
Well?

305
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,859
Nope, not knocked up yet.

306
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,529
It's only been a couple hours,
so just give it some time.

307
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,991
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile,
I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this...

308
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:59,161
...so I'm just gonna, you know,
lie in your chair, okay?

309
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,997
You know, just....

310
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,958
Yeah, good. I'm gonna let gravity,
you know, do its jobs.

311
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,424
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand
with this box?

312
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:15,136
No. Put that box down.
We are not going anywhere!

313
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,348
This is my apartment and I like it.

314
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,684
This is a girl's apartment.

315
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:26,272
That is a boy's apartment.
It's dirty and it smells.

316
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,358
This is pretty. It's so pretty.

317
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,736
And look, and it's purple.

318
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,531
And I'm telling you, you with
your steady hand, I am not moving.

319
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,701
And now I have got the steady hand.

320
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,495
-I'll take care of it.
-That's right.

321
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,581
You do what the hand says.

322
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,970
-How'd it go?
-I lost our mattresses.

323
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,353
<i>Are you in there, little fetus?</i>

324
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,980
<i>In nine months, will you come greet us?</i>

325
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,943
<i>I will buy you some Adidas</i>

326
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,573
-Hi.
-Hi.

327
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,700
Oh, hi, Phoebe?

328
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:24,497
Um, we were just at the drugstore,
um, so we got you a little present.

329
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,918
Um, it's a lollipop
and a home pregnancy test.

330
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,339
Hey, don't mix those up.
You could really ruin that lollipop.

331
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:41,555
So, um, you feel like taking a test?
There's only one question.

332
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,560
All right. I will. No, I will.

333
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,397
But, um, you know, just remember
that it's still really early.

334
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,732
Okay, so if it says
that I'm not pregnant...

335
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,360
...that doesn't mean
I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay?

336
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,446
And just, please,
just so I don't go completely nuts...

337
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,950
...just try not to put all your hopes
on this, okay?

338
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,159
Okay.

339
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,455
Great.

340
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,967
You know what? You are mean boys
who are just being mean.

341
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,470
Hey, don't get mad at us.
No one forced you to raise the stakes.

342
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,223
That is not true. She did. She forced me.

343
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,934
We'd still be here if you hadn't
got the question wrong.

344
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,437
Well, it was a stupid, unfair question!

345
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,272
Don't blame the questions!

346
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,691
Would you all stop yelling
in our apartment?

347
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,860
You are ruining moving day for us.

348
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,654
-Would you stop calling it your apartment?
-It is ours.

349
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,325
Guys, you guys,
you're gonna have a baby.

350
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,077
They're gonna have a baby.

351
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,920
My sister's going to have my baby!

352
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,432
Okay, but this can't be good
for the baby.

353
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,529
I can't find garbage bags.

354
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,865
Oh, I think I saw some in here.

355
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,371
What is it?

356
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:34,376
I don't know. But maybe if we keep
that drawer shut, it'll die.

357
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,255
I can't believe we're living here.

358
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,179
What? What is it?

359
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,056
Did you see the size of the closets?

360
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:52,144
I can't believe we live here.
