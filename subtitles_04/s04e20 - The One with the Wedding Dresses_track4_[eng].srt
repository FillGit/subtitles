1
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,805
Are you kidding me?

2
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,142
Joey?

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:21,647
Joey? Joey, Joey, Joey,
Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey!

4
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,900
Joey. Joey. Joey.

5
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,486
Joey, Joey!

6
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,031
Yeah.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,045
Oh. Oh, did I wake you?

8
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,435
Gunther, could I get
another cup of coffee?

9
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,982
So, uh, what do you do when
you're not working here?

10
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,652
-You don't need to fill these silences.
-Okay, thanks.

11
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,990
Chandler, that's your fourth cup of coffee.

12
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,910
I'm drinking lots because I'm exhausted
because Joey started snoring.

13
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,246
He's in a different room. He's that loud?

14
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,706
Oh, you should hear me.

15
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,753
It's not something to be proud of.
Go to a sleep clinic.

16
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,589
I told you, I'm not going to any clinic.

17
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,342
I don't have a problem.
You're the one with the problem.

18
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,554
You should go to a "Quit-being-
a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.

19
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,723
-They don't have those.
-Yeah, they do.

20
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,225
Quit being a baby and leave me alone!

21
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,811
There, you just had your first class.

22
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,231
I used to go out with this guy
that was a light sleeper.

23
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,525
And whenever I'd snore,
he'd roll me over-

24
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,736
Oh, yeah.

25
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,325
He'd roll me over,
and I'd stop snoring.

26
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,244
Next time you snore,
I'm rolling you over!

27
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,665
I gotta do what I gotta do.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

28
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,959
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

29
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,590
Oh, the Olympics!

30
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,928
-Have you picked a date?
-Huh? Oh.

31
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,096
No. Not yet.

32
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,640
I still can not believe you're engaged.

33
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,436
Just because it's happening so fast.
Not because you're a loser.

34
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,607
Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?

35
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,776
Mm, she's upstairs not doing the dishes.

36
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,153
And I'll tell you,
I'm not doing them this time.

37
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,073
I don't care if those dishes
sit until they're covered-

38
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,200
I'll do them when I get home.

39
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,911
Yeah. Oh, hey.

40
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,497
Um, Emily found this
wedding dress in London-

41
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,499
-Already?
-Yeah, but it didn't fit.

42
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,086
Luckily, there's a store here
with one left in her size.

43
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,629
But I'm the groom-

44
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,715
-I'll pick it up for you.
-Thank you.

45
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,135
She's got you running errands,
picking up wedding dresses....

46
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,721
Ha-ha-ha. Wah-pah!

47
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,475
What's "wah-pah"?

48
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,477
You know. Whipped.

49
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,521
Wah-pah!

50
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,484
That's not whipped. Whipped is:

51
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,614
That's what I did.

52
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,324
Wah-pah!

53
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,661
You can't do anything!

54
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,844
Hey, Mon.

55
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,597
-I was just doing these dishes. Oh—
-Hey.

56
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,391
-Hi.
-Do you, uh, have a minute?

57
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,228
Yeah, I was just about to
take a break anyway.

58
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,690
So listen, uh...

59
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,068
...I know you and I haven't
had a chance to talk...

60
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,197
...since, uh, Emily and I
decided to get married.

61
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,991
And I was just wondering
how you were.

62
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,618
Ahem. Oh.

63
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:49,331
If you were getting married,
heh, I would feel kind of....

64
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,710
-You know?
-Yeah, yeah.

65
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,839
It def- Uh, it definitely took me
by surprise. But, you know...

66
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,300
...uh, I'm okay.

67
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,885
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

68
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,803
I just wanted to check.

69
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,556
Oh, that's sweet. Thank you.
Oh, ha, ha.

70
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,892
-You're great.
-Hmm.

71
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,479
And I know someday this will
happen for you too.

72
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,483
-You just hang in there.
-Ahem.

73
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,902
Uh, heh.

74
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,695
"Hang in there"?

75
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,614
Oh, no, I didn't mean-

76
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:27,244
You haven't heard of a serious
relationship called "me and Joshua"?

77
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,915
Oh. I thought you had
just been on four dates.

78
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,377
I didn't realize that had
become anything.

79
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,505
Oh, yeah. Oh, no, it has become.

80
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,841
Yeah. Oh, no,
those were four great dates.

81
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,261
-Oh. Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

82
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,180
I mean, and the connection!
I mean, you know.

83
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,851
Emotionally, mentally. You know?

84
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,727
Physically.

85
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,606
-Wow. That's incredible.
-I know, isn't it?

86
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,402
I'm right there with Joshua.
You are right there with Emily.

87
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,780
And it's kind of like it's a tie.

88
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,869
I gotta get back to my dishes.

89
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,038
-I gotta get to work.
-Oh, yeah.

90
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,462
You know what would
make me happy?

91
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,339
Oh, yeah, no, what's that?

92
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:25,552
If the four of us could all,
you know, hang out together.

93
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,721
Emily's coming into
town this weekend.

94
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,807
Why don't, uh, we all
have dinner Sunday night?

95
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,893
-That would be great!
-Yeah?

96
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,813
-All right. It's a date!
-Right. Yeah.

97
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,274
"Hang in there." You hang in there.

98
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,987
-Did you say something?
-No, just singing.

99
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,580
Oh, my God!

100
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,543
Oh, look at this one!

101
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,172
-It's so beautiful.
-Yeah. Oof.

102
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,591
About half of these will
end up getting divorced.

103
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,345
May I help you ladies?

104
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,014
Yes, um, I'm here to pick up
a dress on hold.

105
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,599
What's the name?

106
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,685
-Emily Waltham.
-Oh, yes, I have it right here.

107
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,361
Would you like to try it on,
Miss Waltham?

108
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,950
Okay.

109
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,335
You're the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

110
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,088
I am, aren't I?

111
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,216
Miss Waltham?

112
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,468
-Yes?
-We're closing.

113
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,847
All right.

114
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,058
And could I get my ring back?

115
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,197
All right, buddy. Time to roll over.

116
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,911
No, no! No, no, no, no, no!

117
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,749
You are going to a clinic!
You're going to a clinic!

118
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,169
And a pajama store!

119
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,801
Does she use the cups?

120
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,470
Yes, I believe she does.

121
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,600
Does she use the plates?
Yes, I believe she does!

122
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,021
Hmm.

123
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,528
Thank you. Heh.

124
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,072
Aw.

125
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,116
Thank you very much.

126
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,035
Oh, thank you for coming.

127
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,542
-Uh, just a second.
-No, no! Let me in!

128
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,918
-Phoebe?
-Yeah?

129
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,795
-Can you hold on a minute?
-No!

130
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,214
You have to let me in right now!

131
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,801
-Are you alone?
-Yes!

132
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,970
All right.

133
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,480
This sucks.

134
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:28,151
I have to stay up all night
before I go to the stupid clinic.

135
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,652
I'm so tired.

136
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,156
It's 6:00.

137
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,825
-Hi.
-Hey.

138
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,661
I hear you and Joshua
are going out with Ross and Emily.

139
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,997
And I think- I think that's really cool.

140
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,500
Yeah, I think you're handling
that really well.

141
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,919
"Handling it"?

142
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,171
What do you mean?
There's nothing to handle.

143
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,759
Maybe I'd have a problem with this
if it wasn't for me and Joshua.

144
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,513
-They're not gonna get married anyway.
-What?

145
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,683
Come on. They rushed into this thing
so fast, it's ridiculous!

146
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,645
They'll be engaged for like what?
A year?

147
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,773
Somewhere, one of them is gonna
realize what they've done...

148
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,149
...and call the thing off.

149
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,778
You'll be dancing at my wedding
before you dance at theirs.

150
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,030
You know, I don't dance at weddings.

151
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,450
-Why not?
-Weddings are a great place to meet women.

152
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,453
When I dance, I look like this.

153
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,382
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

154
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,886
So, what are you guys doing
four weeks from today?

155
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,263
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

156
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,473
I am...

157
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,643
...free.

158
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,980
Great, because we're getting
married in a month.

159
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,108
-What?
-Yup.

160
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,568
-In a month?
-Yeah.

161
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,070
-You mean 30 days?
-Yeah.

162
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,239
-From now?
-Yeah.

163
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,200
-That's great!
-Yeah, ha, ha.

164
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,954
Emily always wanted to get married
in this place her parents got married...

165
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,915
...but it's gonna be torn down, so....

166
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,836
I know it's crazy,
but everything's been so crazy...

167
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,880
...and it just feels right, you know?

168
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:16,092
Hey, that's the day after
I start menstruating!

169
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,271
This isn't mine.

170
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,616
-Ahem
-Hey, Rachel.

171
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,117
Hi.

172
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,994
-What's up?
-Oh, heh.

173
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,164
Your voice sounded
all squeaky on the phone.

174
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,791
Oh, nothing. I just wanted to see you.

175
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,501
See you and hug you.

176
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,087
Ha, ha. See you, heh.

177
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,089
-Great.
-Yeah!

178
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,258
Sit.

179
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,930
You okay?

180
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,518
I'm more than okay.
I am really, really happy.

181
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,981
Want to know why?

182
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,983
Do I?

183
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,028
Because I am really happy about us.

184
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,323
I think we are so on the right track.

185
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,243
I think we are working.
I think we are clicking.

186
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,371
-You know?
-Yeah, sure, sure.

187
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,414
-We're- We're clicking.
-Yeah.

188
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,833
If there was just one little area...

189
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,379
...where I think we need to work on,
I would think...

190
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,924
...it's that we're
just not crazy enough.

191
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,720
I got to say, I'm not too sure
I agree with that.

192
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,348
Well, yeah. You know, yeah, you're right.

193
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,517
I mean, we have our fun. Yeah?

194
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,519
But, uh--

195
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,523
We ju- I mean, like crazy! You know?

196
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,567
Okay. All right.

197
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,239
This is going to sound,
you know, a little, um, hasty.

198
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,991
But, uh, just go with me.

199
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,955
What if we got married?

200
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,707
Aah? Heh.

201
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,421
-What?
-Oh, I know. It's so totally like:

202
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,590
"Whoa, can we do this?" You know?
I mean-

203
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,885
But it just feels right.
Don't you think? It does.

204
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,139
I mean, it just feels right. Don't you-?

205
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,268
Wow. Uh....

206
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,894
Rachel, um...

207
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,187
...you're...

208
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,481
...a real...

209
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,567
...special lady.

210
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,613
But my divorce isn't final yet...

211
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,533
...and we've been on four dates.

212
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:50,538
So I'm thinking no...

213
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,415
...but...

214
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,250
...thanks.

215
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,587
You idiot!

216
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,178
-Your name, please?
-Joey Tribbiani.

217
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,307
Mm-hm. Did you stay up all night
in preparation for your study?

218
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,351
Uh, sir?

219
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,938
Yes, he did.

220
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,192
All right. We'll call you
in a few minutes.

221
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,029
Whoa. Hey.

222
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,616
Check out that girl.
She is really hot.

223
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,243
Yeah, she is.

224
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,287
Wow.

225
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,707
How you doing?

226
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,547
-What?
-You're coming on to the entire room.

227
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,181
-I'm Chandler. Hi.
-I'm Marjorie. Hi.

228
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,308
-Do you mind if I sit?
-No, please.

229
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,893
So, uh, what are you in for?

230
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,561
I talk in my sleep.

231
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,897
What a coincidence.
I listen in my sleep.

232
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,276
So why don't you
give me your number?

233
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,448
-Are you ready? Okay.
-Yeah.

234
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,703
I got it! Mine! Aah!

235
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,167
-Congratulations!
-Thank you! Ha-ha-ha.

236
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,837
-Okay, my turn, my turn!
-Okay!

237
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,090
Okay, ready?

238
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,970
Okay.

239
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,059
That was a terrible throw!

240
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,937
I won't throw it right to you.
That's not real.

241
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,650
Look at me. My big concern
is what's real?

242
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,156
Oh, my God.

243
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,491
We're really sad, aren't we?

244
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,745
Yeah, I think we are.

245
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,124
This isn't even my dress.

246
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,420
At least you didn't rent yours from
a store called "It's Not Too Late."

247
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,221
-I'm changing out of this.
-Me too.

248
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,975
-In, like, a half an hour?
-Me too.

249
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,896
-All right, now throw it straight this time.
-Okay.

250
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,816
-I'm getting married next!
-Yay!

251
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,115
I hate my regular clothes now.

252
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,202
You know? I look down and I know...

253
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,371
...this isn't gonna be the most
special day of my life.

254
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,375
Yeah. I mean,
it was kind of fun for a while...

255
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,628
...but didn't you feel kind of silly?

256
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,421
I guess.

257
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,424
Oh, my God!

258
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,677
Oh, you're such a cheater!

259
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,972
Hello, little ones.

260
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,307
-Hey.
-Hey.

261
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,309
-So is Joey going to stop snoring?
-Yep!

262
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,354
And a beautiful woman
agreed to go out with me.

263
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:05,316
Joey wanted to ask her out,
but, uh, you know, she picked me.

264
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,068
How'd that happen?

265
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,363
Because I'm cooler.

266
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,491
No, seriously.

267
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,538
She's the kind of girl-
Joey was unconscious.

268
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,126
Hey, you guys! What's happening?

269
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,962
Oh, my God.

270
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,966
-What is that?
-Oh! They gave it to me at the sleep clinic.

271
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,885
And it's going to help me not to snore.

272
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,056
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?

273
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,101
You don't have to
wear it unless you are.

274
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,103
I know I don't have to.

275
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,689
It tastes good.

276
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,900
Plus, you look cool.

277
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,242
Well, I just called Joshua.

278
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,868
Oh, how'd it go?

279
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,579
I did my best to
convince him that I'm not...

280
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,457
...some crazy girl
who is dying to get married.

281
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,419
-And I'm going through a hard time.
-What'd he say?

282
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,255
Well, uh, his answering machine
was very understanding.

283
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,261
I feel blue. Ugh.

284
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,513
-Aw.
-Sweety.

285
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,349
I bet you anything
he'll call you again.

286
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,395
Yeah, maybe. But, you know,
I don't think I even care.

287
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,524
I don't think he's
the one I'm sad about.

288
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:33,571
I know I said I'm totally okay
with Ross getting married.

289
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,656
But as it turns out...

290
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,035
...I don't think I'm handling it
all that well.

291
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,494
Yeah, maybe.

292
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,707
And I'm just trying to figure out why.

293
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,542
Any luck?

294
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,253
Well, yeah. You know how Ross and I
have always been...

295
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,672
...on-again, off-again,
on-again, off-again?

296
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,718
I guess I just figured,
somewhere down the road...

297
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,887
...we would be on-again.

298
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,388
Again.

299
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,892
You know what? I think we all did.

300
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,020
-Hey.
-Hey.

301
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,438
Hey.

302
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,526
-Ahem, hey.
-So.

303
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,862
I got us reservations for Sunday night.

304
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,822
How about Ernie's at 9:00?

305
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,409
Yeah, well, you, uh,
better make it for three.

306
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,205
See, I don't know if we're
going to be hungry at 3:00.

307
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,876
Three people.

308
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,003
Joshua's not going to be there.

309
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,882
-What happened?
-Um, well, I think he broke up with me.

310
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,134
No. Why?

311
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,180
Apparently, he scares easy.

312
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,808
Rachel, I'm sorry.

313
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,310
Eh, it's okay.

314
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,733
Sometimes things don't work out
the way you thought they would.

315
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,695
Come here.

316
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,287
Oh, hey,
don't you have to go pick up Emily?

317
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,081
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

318
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,500
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

319
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,460
I got my girls.

320
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,049
Okay.

321
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,723
Ugh.

322
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,482
Hey, you know what might
cheer you up?

323
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,443
What?

324
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,990
I got to tell you...

325
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,118
...this really does put me
in a better mood.

326
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,498
Ah, I wish there was a job where
I could wear this all the time.

327
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,501
Maybe someday there will be.

328
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,507
Oh, God, that's Chandler coming by
to borrow candles for his big date.

329
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,051
No, Rachel, don't get it!
He'll see us!

330
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,762
No, yeah!
The groom cannot see the bride.

331
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,890
I'm not going to marry Chandler.

332
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,225
Not after this!

333
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,104
Okay guys, just relax.

334
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,402
I do!

335
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,618
-I gotta go.
-Wait, Joshua!

336
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,167
Yeah, well, that ought to do it.

337
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:41,300
Food's here. Fair enough.

338
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,511
Fifteen-minute warning.

339
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,430
Late.

340
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,781
Dude, I am trying to sleep!
