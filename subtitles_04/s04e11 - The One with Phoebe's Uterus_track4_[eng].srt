1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:06,006
I can't believe
my little brother's married!

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,345
Why didn't you tell me
you were eloping?

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,264
Well, we were at court,
eating lunch-

4
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,141
Why were you at court?

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:17,976
Lunch.

6
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,854
We were like...

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:25,275
...we're here, we're having lunch.
Let's get married! Right?

8
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:29,863
A year ago, I didn't know I had
a brother. Now I have a sister!

9
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,952
Oh, it's so great.

10
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,956
Okay.

11
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,958
Okay.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,377
Stop it! Don't!

13
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,005
I'll get you a gift now.

14
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,341
Is there anything you need?

15
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,301
Uh, yeah.

16
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:57,808
We've been trying to get pregnant.
Thought we'd get a jump on things.

17
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,769
No one's getting any younger. Ha-ha-ha.

18
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:06,775
Because the thing is, um, we're not
able to, you know, uh, conceive.

19
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,278
We've seen a bunch of doctors.

20
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,572
They say that our only chance
to have a baby...

21
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:17,911
...is that if they take my sperm,
her egg, put it together in a dish...

22
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,163
...and put it into another girl.

23
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:24,084
We were wondering
if you could be that girl.

24
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,090
That's a really nice gift.

25
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,553
I was thinking of a gravy boat.

26
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,982
Check it out!
Guess what job I just got.

27
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:35,614
I don't know, but Donald Trump
wants his blue blazer black.

28
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:37,824
What?

29
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,912
Blue blazer back.
He wants it back.

30
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:46,625
You said "black." Why would he
want his blue blazer black?

31
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,212
Well, you know what I meant.

32
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,755
You messed it up.

33
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,300
You're stupid.

34
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,930
So what job'd you get?

35
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,266
Tour guide at the museum.
Ross got it for me.

36
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,686
Don't you have to be
a dinosaur expert?

37
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,272
They give you
all the information.

38
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,858
It's like memorizing a script.

39
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,530
On your left, tyrannosaurus rex,
from the Jurassic Period.

40
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,407
Very nice.

41
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,160
Yeah, actually, Joey,
it's the Cretaceous Period.

42
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,123
But I can pronounce Jurassic.

43
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,125
Hey!

44
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,211
Frank Jr. and Alice got married!

45
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,296
Oh, my God!

46
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,881
They're having a baby!

47
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:40,053
They want me to grow it
for them in my uterus!

48
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,892
-My God!
-Are you serious?

49
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,102
Yeah.

50
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,647
You're thinking of
having sex with your brother?

51
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,319
Ew! And, oh, no!

52
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,822
They want me to be the surrogate.

53
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,160
It's her egg and his sperm.
I'm the oven. It's their bun.

54
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,121
What did you say?

55
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,333
I had to think about it,
but what is there to think of?

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,837
I'll be giving someone
the greatest gift.

57
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,258
You'll carry their child,
and get them a Sony PlayStation?

58
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,262
This is an incredible thing to do.

59
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,140
But there are things to think about.

60
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,685
Yeah, you'd be pregnant.
I mean pregnant.

61
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,896
I know.

62
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,066
You'll put your body
through an awful lot.

63
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,653
I mean, morning sickness, uh, labor.

64
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,489
It's all for somebody else.

65
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,532
Yeah. What's your point?

66
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,161
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.

67
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,705
I couldn't do that.

68
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:53,710
I figure, the first time I had a baby,
it'd be with someone I love.

69
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,629
And that baby was, you know...

70
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,422
...a keeper.

71
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,636
You were more supportive when
I wanted to make denim furniture.

72
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,681
If you decide to do this,
we'll be supportive like crazy.

73
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,391
Just think it through.

74
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,728
Talk to somebody who's had a baby.
Like your mom.

75
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,816
My mom never gave birth.
Oh! But my birth mom did!

76
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:27,202
I love this tushy!
Can I take it to work with me?

77
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,540
Yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway.
It came with the pants.

78
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,213
I am so jealous.

79
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,924
You guys are just right there.

80
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,300
Yes.

81
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,761
Right where?

82
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,849
The beginning, where
it's all sex and talking...

83
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,644
...and sex and talking.

84
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,021
You got to love the talking.

85
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,524
And the sex?

86
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,067
We haven't had sex.

87
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,571
What's the big deal?
This is special.

88
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,575
I want our love to grow
before moving to the next level.

89
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,244
Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.

90
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,288
That is really nice...

91
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,956
...lying!

92
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,127
-No way is that the reason.
-Why?

93
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,297
You're not mature enough
to understand that!

94
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,674
He's right. I'm totally lying.

95
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,972
Then what is it?

96
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,266
Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.

97
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:36,813
And you're afraid you won't
be able to fill his shoes?

98
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,985
I'm afraid I won't
make love as well as him.

99
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,696
I was going for the metaphor.

100
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,781
I was saying the actual words.

101
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,995
He's had girlfriends.
It doesn't mean he's great in bed.

102
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,997
We share a wall.

103
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,629
Either he's great, or she liked
to agree with him a lot.

104
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:06,384
It'll be different. The sex will be
great because you are in love.

105
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,887
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

106
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,180
Just go for it.

107
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,848
Yeah, you should.

108
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,851
All right. I'll sleep
with my girlfriend.

109
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,480
But I'm just doing it for you guys.

110
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:26,363
Now, the mastodon is from
the semi-late Jurassic Period.

111
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,367
Isn't the mastodon
from the Pliocene Epoch?

112
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,035
Shh.

113
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,371
This is a museum. No talking.

114
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,041
Right down here we have...

115
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,293
...a large foot.

116
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,800
And over here we have Ross Geller.

117
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,094
Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.

118
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,555
Ross is one of our scientists.
Look at him hard at work.

119
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,562
Okay, moving right along.

120
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,147
Come on.

121
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,903
It's open. Come in.

122
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,823
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-That's okay.

123
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,617
I had time to finish
glazing my nipples.

124
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,080
You go all out
when you're expecting company.

125
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,582
I was working on my pottery.

126
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,584
Oh! Oh!

127
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,922
Oh! I didn't know
that you did pot.

128
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,303
Mostly nudes. It combines
my two passions: pottery and erotica.

129
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,305
Erottery!

130
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,599
Hey! Okay!

131
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,768
Thanks for coming out to see me.

132
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:44,023
I thought it'd be a good idea to
talk about this baby stuff in person.

133
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,360
I don't think it's a good idea.

134
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,196
Why not?

135
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,699
You'd be giving up a baby.

136
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,701
And I really don't-

137
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,953
I don't know if anything I say...

138
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:01,041
...would make you understand the pain
of giving up a baby.

139
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,333
So....

140
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:09,382
No, no, I understand the pain.
Don't hurt the puppy!

141
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,218
No, no. The puppy is yours.

142
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,763
I get a puppy?

143
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,639
But for only three days.

144
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,224
Why?

145
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:25,732
I realize I don't have any right
to start getting parenty on you now.

146
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:35,158
Look at me and not the puppy.
It's very important.

147
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,328
I know what I'm talking about.

148
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,414
I gave up two babies.

149
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:46,419
I only wish I had someone
who'd given up babies that told me...

150
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,546
...how terrible it is.

151
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,969
It'd be something you'd regret
every day for the rest of your life.

152
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:00,266
So however hard it is for you
to give up this puppy...

153
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,687
...it'd be a million times harder
to give up a child.

154
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,610
I shouldn't have given you
the puppy first.

155
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,952
Could you sit there? I'm saving
this seat for my friend Ross.

156
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,578
You mean Dr. Geller?

157
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,957
Doctor? I didn't know
he had a nickname.

158
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,168
Oh, he won't sit here.

159
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,462
Only people in white coats
sit there.

160
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,674
Only people in blue blazers
sit here.

161
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,759
How come?

162
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,010
That's how it is.

163
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,179
That's crazy.

164
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:43,476
It's crazy in a perfect world:
a world without lab coats and blazers.

165
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,105
But you not in a perfect world.
You in a museum now.

166
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,900
See that scientist?

167
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:56,072
He and I used to play together
in grade school, but now....

168
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,576
Peter! Hey, Peter!

169
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,830
It's me, Rhonda from P.S. 129?

170
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,250
I shared my pudding with you, man!

171
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,504
I gave you my snack pack!

172
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,718
See? He pretend
he don't even hear me!

173
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,763
Everyone's pretending
they don't hear you.

174
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,144
I don't know about your jackets
and separate tables...

175
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,854
...but Ross is my friend.

176
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,149
And if I save him a seat,
he will sit in it.

177
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,819
Ross. Ross.

178
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,738
Here! I saved you a seat!

179
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,453
I'm cool here.
I'll catch up with you later.

180
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,500
This is saved.

181
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,671
Gift shop.

182
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,141
I'm sorry about
what happened today.

183
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,811
You do what you got to do.

184
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:13,316
The scientists and the tour guides
never sit together.

185
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,280
It's like that everywhere.
Mon, back me up.

186
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,659
Where you work, the waiters
eat with the waiters.

187
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,370
And the chefs eat
with the other chefs?

188
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,999
I eat by myself in the alley,
because everybody hates me.

189
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,920
Look, Ross.

190
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,672
It's no big deal.

191
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,341
You wear a white coat.
I wear a blue blazer.

192
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,303
If that means we can't be
friends at work, so be it.

193
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,930
I understand, you know?

194
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:48,935
When I'm in a play and you're in
the audience, I don't talk to you.

195
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,188
So it's, you know, it's, uh, cool.

196
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,940
I'll see you tomorrow.

197
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:00,071
When we're in the audience,
he does wave.

198
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,207
-Hi.
-Hey.

199
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,628
Why's Phoebe singing
to Karl Maiden?

200
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,466
I think it's time for puppy
to go out again.

201
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,927
-Come on, let's go to the balcony.
-What?

202
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,347
The street.
Come on, let's go to the street.

203
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,059
Don't go on the balcony
until after I get back.

204
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,063
So did you do it?

205
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,733
Yes, yes, we had the sex.

206
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,985
Uh-oh. It was bad?

207
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:44,073
It was fine, but she didn't agree
with me as strongly as with Joey.

208
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,620
She was like, uh, "I see your point.
I'm all right with it."

209
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:55,084
There's not always a lot of agreement
the first time.

210
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,255
Yeah. Not for girls, anyway.
Guys agree like that.

211
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,258
Look, you have to help me.

212
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,634
I mean-

213
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:08,431
I know what to do with a woman.
It's always nice.

214
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,932
I need to know...

215
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,143
...what makes it go from nice to...

216
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,271
..."My God! Somebody's killing her
in there!"

217
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,442
I'll show you something
a lot of guys don't know.

218
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,445
All right.

219
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,946
Now.

220
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,992
You don't have to draw an actual-
Whoa, she's hot!

221
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,788
Everyone knows the erogenous zones.

222
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,539
You got one, two, three...

223
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,625
...four...

224
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,920
...five, six and seven.

225
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,880
There are seven?

226
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,383
Let me see that.

227
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,468
Oh, yeah.

228
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,263
That's one?

229
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,307
Kind of an important one.

230
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,393
I was looking at it upside down.

231
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,857
Well, you know sometimes that helps.

232
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:09,826
Most guys will hit one, two, three
and then go to seven and set up camp.

233
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,162
That's bad?

234
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:17,375
At Disneyland, you don't spend
the whole day on the Matterhorn.

235
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,086
You might if it were like seven.

236
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,175
The important thing is
to take your time.

237
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,010
You want to hit them all...

238
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,638
...mix them up.
Keep them on their toes.

239
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:31,973
Oh, toes!

240
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,897
For some people.

241
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,191
All right.

242
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,862
You could, uh, start out
with a little one.

243
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,405
A two.

244
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,906
A one, two, three.

245
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,783
A three.

246
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,327
A five.

247
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,329
A four.

248
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,206
A three, two.

249
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,417
Two. A two, four, six.

250
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,170
Two, four, six.

251
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,046
Four. Two.

252
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,924
Two. Four, seven!

253
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,720
Five, seven! Six, seven!

254
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,306
Seven! Seven!

255
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,391
Seven,seven,seven!

256
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,561
Seven!

257
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,119
Dr. Geller? There's a seat here.

258
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,581
Thank you, Dr. Phillips.

259
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,458
But I'm having my lunch...

260
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,836
...at this table.
Here in the middle.

261
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,755
I'm eating...

262
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,800
...right here
with my good friend, Joey.

263
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,969
If he'll sit with me.

264
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,602
I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.

265
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:05,942
You know...

266
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,612
...we work in a museum
of natural history.

267
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,365
And yet, there is something...

268
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,116
...unnatural...

269
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,119
...about the way we eat lunch.

270
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:23,000
I look around, and you know what I see?
I see division.

271
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,214
Division between people in white coats
and people in blue blazers.

272
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,675
I ask myself, "My God, why?"

273
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,846
Now, I say we shed these coats...

274
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,765
...that separate us.

275
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,978
And we get to know
the people underneath.

276
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,274
I'm Ross!

277
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,777
I'm divorced and I have a kid!

278
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,369
I'm Joey! I'm an actor!

279
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,872
I don't know squat about dinosaurs!

280
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:09,588
I'm Ted, and I just moved here,
and New York really scares me.

281
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,758
-There you go!
-Hang in there, Teddy!

282
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,511
I'm Andrew.

283
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,472
And I didn't pay for this pear.

284
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,393
Okay. Good for you.

285
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:27,440
I'm Rhonda!
And these aren't real!

286
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,571
Wow, Rhonda.

287
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,326
-I'm Scott.
-Yeah, okay, Scott!

288
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:43,581
I flip the light switch on and off
17 times when I leave a room...

289
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,249
...or my family will die.

290
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,130
My mom will be here soon.

291
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,716
I can't. I can't give him up.

292
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,510
Yes, no. I can.

293
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,387
I don't want to.

294
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,473
But I can.

295
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,266
No.

296
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,562
I can't watch this.
It's like <i>Sophie's Choice.</i>

297
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,857
You know, I never saw that.

298
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,151
Oh, it was only okay.

299
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,321
I can't do this.

300
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,700
My mom was right.
If I can't give him up...

301
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,203
...there's no way
I can give up a baby.

302
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,457
Frank and Alice
are going to be so crushed.

303
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,294
What else can I give them?
A kidney!

304
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,384
We were in the neighborhood.

305
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:40,721
We want to let you know that
there's still no pressure.

306
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,931
None.

307
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,602
If there was something you wanted
to say, we'll be right there.

308
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,229
Okay.

309
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,439
Who's this little guy?

310
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,025
Oh, um, well....

311
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,822
He's so cute! He reminds me
of my old dog, Tumor.

312
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,369
You are so precious,
I'd take you home.

313
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,913
Why don't you?

314
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,665
Are you serious?

315
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,999
Uh-huh. Yeah.

316
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,960
Thanks.

317
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,133
-What are you doing?
-I'm okay with this.

318
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,760
You know why?
Because look at them.

319
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,804
Look how happy they are.

320
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,932
And I made that, so you know...

321
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,439
...it'll be a million times harder
to give up a baby. But God!

322
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,400
It'll feel a million times
better, right?

323
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,863
I'll do this.
I want to carry your baby.

324
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,781
Oh!

325
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,908
Oh!

326
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,494
Thank you so much!

327
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,497
You don't know what this means to us.

328
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,334
I think I'm going to cry!

329
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,758
It's going to be so great.

330
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:01,969
Hi.

331
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,514
-What's going on?
-I gave them the puppy.

332
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:09,602
It made them so happy,
I decided to carry their baby.

333
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,188
-Phoebe-
-No, I know.

334
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,064
We're different, though.

335
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,567
This is a different situation.

336
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,195
I am not going to regret this.

337
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,281
I understand all that.

338
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,825
It's just, that was my puppy.

339
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,035
Oh!

340
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,000
Would you ever be a surrogate?

341
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,710
Depends who asked.

342
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,629
What if I asked?

343
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,465
Oh, Mon, sure!

344
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,926
-Really?
-Yes.

345
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,806
-You're not asking me, are you?
-No.

346
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,184
Yes. Totally.

347
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,066
Thank you! Thank you!

348
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,526
Thank you!

349
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,694
Yes, thank you!
