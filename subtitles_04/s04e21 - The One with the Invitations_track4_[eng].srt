1
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,548
It seems like all of a sudden,
so much is happening.

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,176
I know.
Ross is getting married.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,262
Phoebe's making people.

4
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,265
-Everybody's doing stuff.
-We just sit here.

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,976
If I died, the only way
people would know I was here...

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,687
...would be by the ass print
on this chair.

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,025
Look, we have to do something.
Okay? Something huge.

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,028
We could climb Mount Everest.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,740
No, no. Not something stupid.
Something huge.

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,201
No, no, no.
I saw an ad for this video.

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,079
People climb that thing every day.
We could totally do that.

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,083
Why not?
I mean, it's just climbing.

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,834
It's just steep.

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,044
Yeah.

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,257
We're going to Everest. Okay?
It'd be nice to leave an ass print on Everest.

16
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,467
-Hey.
-Hey.

17
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,719
-What's up?
-We're gonna climb Mount Everest.

18
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,554
-Yeah, baby.
-Really?

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,515
I looked into that.

20
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:02,187
Yeah, but, I mean, it costs like $60,000,
and, you know, you could die. And....

21
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,189
And you would die.

22
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,192
Oh, well.

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,736
We could get that Everest video.

24
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,532
Yeah, we could do that without,
you know, risking our lives at all.

25
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,411
While we're down at the video store,
we could rent <i>Die Hard.</i>

26
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,540
Oh. You know what?
I just remembered.

27
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,668
That Everest thing is only available
through mail order.

28
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:25,919
Oh, well.

29
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,422
So you guys will stay here
and hang out with me?

30
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,549
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

31
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,677
But I'll tell you, one of these days...

32
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,097
...we're gonna get off our butts
and rent <i>Die Hard </i>again.

33
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,890
Yeah, we are.

34
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,818
So, what did we decide?
Does your uncle Nathan get an invite or not?

35
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,029
Oh, God.
Nobody likes him.

36
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:38,325
And he's so cheap. He'd never fly
to London in a million years.

37
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,701
Yeah, invite him.

38
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,538
Hey, did I do these neat enough?

39
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,708
-Yeah, they're fine.
-Yeah?

40
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,544
If anyone asks,
we'll say that Ben addressed them.

41
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,090
Oh. So you invited Rachel then?

42
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:54,841
Sure, why not?

43
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,718
-Really?
-Yeah.

44
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:01,556
Well, I don't think I'd be comfortable
having any of my old lovers there.

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,810
Wait, wait, wait.
Do you think we shouldn't invite her?

46
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,813
Oh, no, no, Ross,
you know I absolutely adore Rachel.

47
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,858
It's just that, well, I thought
it might be a bit awkward for you.

48
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,528
But it's absolutely your decision.

49
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,446
-More tea?
-Yeah, sure.

50
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,075
-Earl Grey?
-Huh?

51
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,160
Fine, yeah,
invite whoever you want.

52
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:32,337
I don't want to be single, okay?
I just want to be married again.

53
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,636
And I just want a million dollars.

54
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,180
Rachel?

55
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,392
-Oh, God, Monica. Hi. Thank God.
-Hi.

56
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,897
Okay. Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

57
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,859
This is everybody.
This is Chandler and Phoebe...

58
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,152
...and Joey.

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,195
-Do you remember my brother, Ross?
-Sure.

60
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,489
-Hey. Oh, God.
-Hi.

61
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,076
You know, back in high school...

62
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,705
...I had a, um, major crush on you.

63
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,500
-I knew.
-You did? Oh, okay.

64
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,546
I always figured you just thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

65
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,382
-I did.
-Oh.

66
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,760
Listen, do you think-?

67
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,556
And try not to let my intense
vulnerability become a factor here.

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,519
Do you think it would be okay
if I asked you out sometime maybe?

69
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,563
Yeah.

70
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,774
Maybe.

71
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,109
Okay.

72
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,236
Okay, maybe I will.

73
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,532
See, I see, uh...

74
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,993
...big passion in your future.

75
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,995
-Really?
-I do.

76
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,916
Oh, Ross, you're so great.
Aw....

77
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,469
It's never gonna happen.

78
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,181
Okay, I have a question.

79
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,769
Well, uh, actually,
it's not so much a question...

80
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,480
...as more of a general wondering...

81
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,107
...ment.

82
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,901
-Okay.
-Okay.

83
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,907
Um, well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to, um....

84
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,493
-Oh....
-Yes. Yes. That's-

85
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,037
-Look at that little kitty.
-That's right.

86
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,956
-What?
-That little kitty.

87
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,460
<i>Top of the world looking</i>

88
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,254
<i>Down on creation</i>

89
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:42,926
<i>And the only explanation I can find</i>

90
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:48,056
Listen, missy, if you want this cart,
you're gonna have to take me with it.

91
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,144
Yes.

92
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,230
-Did you see that?
-You were incredible.

93
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,024
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

94
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,652
Thank you. I could not
have done this without you.

95
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,244
Okay, um.... Uh....

96
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,037
More clothes in the dryer?

97
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,206
-Oh.
-Oh!

98
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,666
I'm fine. I'm fine.

99
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,544
You had no right to tell me
you ever had feelings for me.

100
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,879
-What?
-I was doing great with Julie...

101
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,464
...before I found out about you.

102
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,758
I was doing great
before I found out about you.

103
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,177
You think it's easy for me
to see you with Julie?

104
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,222
Well, the point is
I don't need this right now.

105
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,141
Okay? It's too late.

106
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,311
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy. This ship has sailed.

107
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,980
All right, fine.
Go ahead and do that, all right, Ross?

108
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,523
I don't need your stupid ship.

109
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,525
-Good.
-Good.

110
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,779
Oh!

111
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,007
Oh.

112
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,285
Do you realize this is the first time
I'm doing something I care about?

113
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,538
This is the first time I'm doing
something I'm actually good at.

114
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,165
If you don't get that-

115
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,960
I get that. I get that bigtime.
And I'm happy for you...

116
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,504
...but I'm tired of having a relationship
with your answering machine.

117
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,298
-I don't know what to do anymore.
-Well, neither do I.

118
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,966
Is this about Mark?

119
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,720
-Oh, my God.
-Okay, it's not.

120
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,263
Oh, my God.

121
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,725
I cannot keep having this same fight
over and over again, Ross.

122
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,645
No. You're making this too hard.

123
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,980
I'm making this too hard?
What do you want me to do?

124
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,110
I don't know. I don't know.
Look, maybe we should just take a break.

125
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,279
You're right. Let's take a break.
Let's cool off, okay?

126
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,157
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

127
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,909
No.

128
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,662
A break from us.

129
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,254
-Do I know why we're rushing?
-You know the girlfriend I told you about?

130
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,382
It turns out that she, uh, wants
to get back together with me.

131
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,633
Oh, I found it!

132
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,969
-That's so great for you guys.
-Yeah.

133
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,390
-Good luck with your girlfriend.
-Oh, thank you- Ah, hey.

134
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,813
Rachel!

135
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,982
Hi. Oh....

136
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,193
-You got my message?
-You are right on time.

137
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,863
So, what do you say?
Can I be your girlfriend again?

138
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,614
Yes, you can very much.

139
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,033
Ah!

140
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,328
-I want you to leave. Get out.
-No. No.

141
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,372
I wanna stay.
I wanna talk about this.

142
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,875
All right. How was she?

143
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,293
Oh-oh.

144
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,007
-What?
-Was she good?

145
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,258
Don't answer that.

146
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:16,014
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Let's talk about it. How was she?

147
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,266
She was....

148
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,185
-Awful.
-She was not good, not good.

149
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,145
Nothing compared to you.

150
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,022
She was different.

151
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,607
-Ooh!
-Oh-oh.

152
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,735
Good different?

153
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,072
Nobody likes change.

154
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,365
Oh! Just stop.

155
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,952
The way you owned up to everything...

156
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:42,540
...it just showed me how much
you've grown, you know?

157
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,336
I mean, my mom never thought
this would work out.

158
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,257
She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

159
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,510
Mm-hm.

160
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,053
Oh....

161
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,681
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.

162
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:03,686
But if time was what you needed
just to gain a little perspective....

163
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,526
We were on a break!

164
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,871
You seem to really like her.

165
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,834
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?
We agreed it was gonna be a two-week thing.

166
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,794
You know? No commitment.

167
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:33,132
Ross, that girl just spent
the entire evening talking to your friends...

168
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,802
...asking to hear stories about you...

169
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,680
...looking through Monica's photo albums.

170
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,975
I mean, you don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

171
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,269
You think? Heh.

172
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,565
You've got like 14 hours
until she has to be at the airport.

173
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,109
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...

174
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,654
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

175
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,285
-Yeah, you're right.
-Yeah.

176
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,048
Oh, this is so amazing.

177
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,968
I can't believe my brother's
getting married, and in London.

178
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,220
It's so romantic.

179
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,557
Hey, pretty smart.

180
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,850
Tissue paper.

181
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,519
You're at the wedding.
You have to cry.

182
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,147
Handkerchief?
No, I got my invitation.

183
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,109
Oh, look, isn't this adorable?

184
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,112
Ross let Ben address mine.

185
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:37,989
-Hello.
-Hey.

186
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,198
-Hey.
-Hey.

187
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,951
Hey, did you get your invitation
to Ross' wedding?

188
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,078
No.

189
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,208
Don't worry, man, I get to bring a guest.
We'll show him.

190
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,376
I'm so jealous you're all going.

191
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,755
I can't believe I never knew
you can't fly in your third trimester.

192
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,214
-I never knew that.
-I didn't, either.

193
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,966
I knew that.

194
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,219
So didn't know that.
But you should see your faces.

195
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,057
-Hi, guys. What's up?
-Hey.

196
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,934
We're hanging out.

197
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,275
What's this?
Is this Ross' wedding invitation?

198
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,029
Maybe that's the one
we should have actually hidden.

199
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,866
Oh, no. No, you guys, come on.
You don't have to do that.

200
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,910
I'm happy for him.

201
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,829
I am. I really- I'm- I'm ha-

202
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,665
I'll work on it.

203
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,667
I'm sorry, honey.

204
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,919
Mm.

205
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,630
Rach, you're going to come though,
aren't you?

206
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,424
Oh, honey, I don't know. I....

207
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,262
This isn't one of those
"If she doesn't come, we don't come"?

208
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,056
Because I already bought my ticket....

209
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,354
You know what would be real weird?
If you weren't there.

210
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,359
-Just say you'll think about it, okay?
-No, I'll think about it. Yeah.

211
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,281
-Who's this from?
-That's Ross'.

212
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,532
Oh.

213
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,330
Oh, my God.

214
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,666
He remembered.

215
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,084
Remembered what?

216
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,296
It was like months ago.
We were walking by this antique store.

217
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:21,050
I saw this pin, and I told him
it was just like one my grandmother had...

218
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,636
...when I was a little girl. Oh.

219
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,139
I can't believe he remembered.

220
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,807
This must have cost him a fortune.

221
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,183
I can't believe he did this.

222
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,103
Remember back in college
when he fell in love with Carol...

223
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,398
...and bought her
that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?

224
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,692
What did you just say?

225
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,914
Oh, my God.

226
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,293
<i>Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.</i>

227
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,548
Oh, my God.

228
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,968
-We were in school together.
-We haven't seen each other since then.

229
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,597
Well, I land in China.
Guess who's in charge of the dig?

230
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,973
Julie!

231
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,018
Julie! Isn't that great?

232
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:17,190
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

233
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,320
Oh, that is so sweet.

234
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,573
No- Hen.

235
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,784
No- Okay.
No, you hang up.

236
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,953
No, you-
Okay. Okay.

237
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,998
One, two, three.

238
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,502
You didn't hang up either.

239
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,004
-She didn't hang up.
-She didn't hang up either.

240
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,884
Okay, no.

241
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,302
No, you hang up.

242
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:49,013
You. You. Y-

243
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,144
Ross, hi.

244
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,146
It's Rachel.

245
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:01,192
I'm just calling to say
that, um, everything's fine.

246
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,653
And I'm really happy for you...

247
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,072
...and your cat.

248
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,786
So obviously, I am over you.

249
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,123
I am over you.

250
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:20,378
And that, my friend,
is what they call closure.

251
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,924
Rach, I got a message from you.

252
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,593
Oh, my God, no.
Hang up the phone. Give me the phone.

253
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,140
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

254
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,730
You're over me?

255
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,732
Oh, God.

256
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,152
-What-? You're, uh...?
-Oh, God.

257
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,445
You're over me?

258
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,324
-Oh, my God.
-When were you...

259
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,201
...under me?

260
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,622
Basically, ahem...

261
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,125
...lately, I've, uh....

262
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,462
Ahem. I've sort of had feelings for you.

263
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,673
Okay, I need to lie down.

264
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,676
He broke up with Julie.

265
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,264
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes.

266
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,976
-Really?
-Really.

267
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,146
It's always been you, Rach.

268
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,106
Oh, God.

269
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,821
Oh....

270
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,950
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

271
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,369
Oh, that's okay.

272
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,372
-You're worth the wait.
-Oh.

273
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,791
And I don't just mean tonight.

274
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:48,299
<i>I never dreamed
That I'd meet somebody like you</i>

275
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,764
<i>I never dreamed
That I'd lose somebody like you</i>

276
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:05,399
<i>No, I don't want to fall in love</i>

277
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,986
Oh, God!

278
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,447
Oh. Honey.

279
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,241
Oh, that's okay.

280
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,245
Oh, no, you just rolled over
the juice box.

281
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,251
Gunther, please tell me
you didn't say anything to Rachel...

282
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,503
...about me and the girl
from the copy place.

283
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,421
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,590
Was I not supposed to?

285
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,099
You're the one who ended it.

286
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:42,311
Yeah, because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.

287
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,647
You still love me?

288
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,524
No.

289
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:52,446
What does this mean? What do you-?
I mean, do you want to get back together?

290
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,157
No. Maybe.

291
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,618
-I don't- I don't know.
-What?

292
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,871
I just- I feel....

293
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:14,385
I can't believe I even thought of getting back
together with you. We are so over.

294
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,513
Fine by me!

295
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,727
And, hey, just so you know,
it's not that common...

296
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,606
...it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!

297
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,442
I knew it!

298
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:44,040
<i>Rachel's coming up.
Doesn't she look pretty, Jack?</i>

299
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,834
Oh, my God.

300
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,754
-This is us getting ready for the prom.
-Oh!

301
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,006
You know what?
We don't have to watch this.

302
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,716
-Yeah, we do.
-Come on.

303
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:54,925
Fun.

304
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,302
<i>Get a shot of Monica.</i>

305
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,179
<i>Wait, how do you zoom out?</i>

306
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,514
<i>There she is.</i>

307
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,810
Shut up.
The camera adds 10 pounds.

308
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,688
Huh, so how many cameras
are actually on you?

309
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,691
<i>Dad, turn it off.</i>

310
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,193
-<i>It is off.
-Yeah.</i>

311
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,944
<i>Right, Ross?</i>

312
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,785
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.

313
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,124
<i>I can't go to my own prom without a date.
I can't. It's too late.</i>

314
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,628
<i>If you're not going,
then I don't wanna go either.</i>

315
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,838
<i>I have a wonderful idea.</i>

316
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,299
<i>You should take Rachel to the prom.</i>

317
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,259
We've seen enough.
Let's turn it off.

318
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,554
-I want to see.
-Fine, I'm not going to watch, all right?

319
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:41,847
<i>Come on, kid. Let's go.</i>

320
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,767
<i>Are you handsome.</i>

321
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,602
<i>Let's show them.</i>

322
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,317
<i>-Okay, Dad.
-Rachel, ready or not.</i>

323
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,653
<i>Here comes your knight in shining-</i>

324
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,946
<i>Oh, no.</i>

325
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:01,909
-<i>Bye. Don't wait up.
-Okay, Chip, let's go.</i>

326
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,829
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

327
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,664
<i>Jack, how do I turn this off?</i>

328
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,043
I can't believe you did that.

329
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,587
Yeah, well....

330
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,441
See? He's her lobster.

331
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,161
No.

332
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,164
-You're really not going?
-Yeah.

333
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,749
It's just going to be too hard.

334
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,377
You know, I mean...

335
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,421
...it's Ross.

336
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,716
How can I watch him get married?

337
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,304
You know?
It's just for the best, you know? It is.

338
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,307
Plus somebody's
got to stay here with Phoebe.

339
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,310
She's going to be pretty big by then...

340
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,521
...and she'll need someone
to help her tie her shoes.

341
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,941
Drive her to the hospital
in case she goes into labor.

342
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,486
You don't have a car.

343
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,155
-And your license expired.
-I know.

344
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,618
Yeah. See, there's so much to do,
and I have so little time to do it in.

345
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,459
Check this out.

346
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,129
It says there's a place you can go
to rent videos of all the museums.

347
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,216
"It's almost as good as being there."

348
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,136
It's better. You can't go to a museum
in your underwear.

349
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,556
Well, you could,
but probably just the one time.

350
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,810
I bet we could get videos
of all the sights...

351
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,606
...get a VCR in our hotel room,
we'd never even have to go outside.

352
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,192
If we do that,
we've got to rent <i>Die Hard.</i>

353
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,072
Oh-ho, I bet the British version is good.
