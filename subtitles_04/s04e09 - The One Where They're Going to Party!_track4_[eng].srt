1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,257
-Okay.
-Come on, no peeking.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,345
Our eyes are closed, and we're about
to cross the street. Very good.

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,305
Okay. Open up.

4
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:22,606
What do you want to show us?
Because all I can see is this bitchen van.

5
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,776
Yeah, it's for our catering business.

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,986
-Oh.
-I think I know that girl.

7
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,700
-We're not gonna keep it this way, though.
-No?

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,912
We're gonna paint over the sword
and replace it with a baguette.

9
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,747
Oh.

10
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:42,167
Um, also, we don't know what to do
with this.

11
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,214
Oh, yeah, I definitely know her.

12
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,310
Remember that guy from cooking school
that put cilantro in everything?

13
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,312
-Oh, sure, Cilantro Larry.
-Yeah.

14
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:47,607
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic
for the <i>Chelsea Reporter.</i>

15
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:52,613
Wow. Monica, what an amazing opportunity
to influence...

16
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,323
...dozens of people.

17
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,161
What about our catering business?

18
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,163
Oh, no, no, it's just one night a week.

19
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,957
Plus, I get to take all of you out
for free dinners.

20
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,292
-Hey.
-Oh.

21
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,543
Well, in that case:

22
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,008
-That was me hopping onboard.
-Oh.

23
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:18,013
Hey, guys. Hey, Ross.
Quick question for you.

24
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,681
Are you ready to party?

25
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,560
I don't know, I could maybe go out
for a couple of beers.

26
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:27,856
But there's this thing about bumblebees
on the Discovery Channel.

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,236
No, no, no, I don't think you heard me.
Are you ready to party?

28
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,531
No.

29
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,867
Gandalf? Gandalf is coming to town?

30
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,161
Kathy's with her parents,
I have nothing to do.

31
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,705
Tomorrow we are partying
with Gandalf, dude.

32
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:48,627
Dude, we are so gonna party. Yeah.

33
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,670
Wow, okay. Dude alert.

34
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,174
And who is this guy?

35
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:58,595
Mike "Gandalf" Ganderson.
Only, like, the funnest guy in the world.

36
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,389
I'm gonna call
and get off work tomorrow.

37
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,725
Oh. I'm gonna call after you.

38
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,853
This is gonna be so cool.
Dude, we never party anymore.

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,272
Whoo!

40
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,276
All right, were you guys
smoking something in the back of our van?

41
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,614
What do you mean, we never have fun?
You have fun with me.

42
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:21,910
Remember the time we saw those strippers
and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?

43
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:28,208
Joey, you are gonna love this guy.
Gandalf is like the party wizard.

44
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,003
-Well, why do you call him Gandalf?
-Gandalf the wizard.

45
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,717
Hello? Didn't you read
<i>Lord of the Rings </i>in high school?

46
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,761
No, I had sex in high school.

47
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:50,522
Oh. Uh, Joanna? I was wondering
if I could ask you something.

48
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,400
There's an opening for an assistant buyer
in Junior Miss-

49
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,610
Okay, but that would be a step down
for me.

50
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,238
No, actually, I meant for me.

51
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,949
The hiring committee
is meeting people all day and....

52
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:06,121
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but I guess
you can't stay my assistant forever.

53
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,207
Neither can you, Sophie,
but for different reasons.

54
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,128
I'm so glad
you don't have a problem with this.

55
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,630
If you did,
I wouldn't have considered applying.

56
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,840
Really? In that case-

57
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,217
And that's why I'm so glad
there's no problem.

58
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:23,847
Yeah, it's fine. I'm on the hiring committee,
so there'll be one friendly face.

59
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,432
Oh, that's great.

60
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,185
-You know, Junior Miss is where I started.
-Really?

61
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,605
I had to sleep with the ugliest guy
to get that job.

62
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,234
-Really?
-No. Ha, ha.

63
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,986
Yeah.

64
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,698
-I mean, no. No, no, no. Ha, ha.
-No. Ha, ha.

65
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,202
I'm sure with your qualifications,
you won't need to sleep with some guy.

66
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,411
Oh. Ha, ha.

67
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,705
Although, uh,
I might need some convincing.

68
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,918
-Urn- Oh.
-Kidding. Ha, ha.

69
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,255
-God, I feel wild today.
-Aah!

70
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,680
Oh, man, I am so excited, I may vomit.

71
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,602
Will you calm down?
He's just a human guy.

72
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,563
Look, you don't understand.
Gandalf is amazing.

73
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,357
You never know what's gonna happen.

74
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:19,986
You go out for a couple of beers and
end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia.

75
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,781
-Really?
-Oh, yeah, it's beautiful country up there.

76
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,200
Hey. Okay.

77
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:30,205
I got my passport, fresh socks,
and a snakebite kit.

78
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,041
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.

79
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,044
All right, I'll see you guys.

80
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,839
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

81
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,883
I have an audition,
but I'll hook up with you later.

82
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,885
-Where you gonna be around noon?
-Heh.

83
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,179
Somewhere maybe along the equator?

84
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,849
Okay.

85
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,645
Hello?

86
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:54,980
It's Gandalf.

87
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,776
So are you in town?

88
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,446
Oh, well....

89
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,074
Well, maybe next time, then.

90
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,034
What happened?

91
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,287
He's not gonna make it.
He's stuck in Chicago.

92
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,788
Oh, man.

93
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,624
Chicago's so lucky.

94
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,296
Stupid, useless Canadian money.

95
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,804
You have a very impressive resume,
Ms. Green.

96
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:32,309
I especially like what I see here
about implementing a new filing system.

97
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,977
Thank you.

98
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:38,106
Filing system? Oh, you mean those little
colored labels you put on all the folders?

99
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,651
It certainly did brighten up
the inside of the filing cabinets.

100
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,281
Well, they, uh- They did more than that.

101
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:50,493
I notice that you've been entrusted
with a lot of important responsibilities.

102
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,165
Yes. Joanna really has been
an incredible mentor to me.

103
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:59,127
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible
at getting my morning bagel.

104
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,922
It's amazing how she gets it right
almost every time.

105
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,384
Of course,
I have more responsibilities than that.

106
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:12,140
Oh, yes, of course. There's the coffee too.
Rachel can carry two things at once.

107
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,644
That's, uh, very good.

108
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,855
Now, a big part of this job...

109
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,942
...is cultivating personal relationships,
especially with designers.

110
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,654
-Yes, I realize-
-Rachel shouldn't have any problem.

111
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,532
Her only problem might be getting a little
too friendly, if you know what I mean.

112
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,410
I love working with designers.

113
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,705
With them, under them,
what's the difference, eh, Rach?

114
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,630
Hey. My first review is out.

115
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,549
Oh! Oh, the <i>Chelsea Reporter.</i>

116
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,011
Ah. These used to keep me so warm.

117
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,056
-All right, look, I'm on the back page.
-Ooh. Oh!

118
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:57,435
Okay. "Would I go back to Allesandro's?
Sure, but I would have to order two meals.

119
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,189
One for me, and one for the guy
pointing the gun to my head."

120
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,317
Wow, you really laid into this place.

121
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,654
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word
to make friends.

122
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,324
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy
who could fix up the van for catering.

123
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,702
-Oh. You want me to go with you?
-No, no, it's okay.

124
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,579
But are we sure
we don't want the waterbed?

125
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,291
-Haven't we made this decision?
-Yeah, all right.

126
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,545
-Bye.
-Bye.

127
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,885
Who is it?

128
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,847
<i>It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.</i>

129
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,516
Oh, my God.

130
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,936
-<i>I wanna talk to you about your review.
</i>-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

131
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,313
Call me on the phone.

132
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,358
<i>What, so you can hang up on me?</i>

133
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,278
I'm never gonna let you up,
so you may as well just go away.

134
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,654
<i>Just give me a chance to—</i>

135
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,115
<i>Do you need to get in? Here you go.</i>

136
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,325
-No, Phoebe!
-<i>Oh, hey, Monica.</i>

137
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,544
I want a retraction.
Our food is not "inedible swill."

138
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,754
I couldn't eat it.

139
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,424
I have five friends who couldn't eat it,
and one of them eats books.

140
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,011
Well, our service is not
"grossly incompetent."

141
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,306
The waiter carried the breadsticks
in his pants.

142
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,352
Well, you said that we accept
the Discover Card...

143
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,938
...which we do not.

144
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,816
All right, that I'll retract.

145
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,195
But I stand by my review.
I know food, and that wasn't it.

146
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,739
Your marinara sauce
tastes like tomato juice.

147
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,867
You should serve it with vodka
and a piece of celery.

148
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,369
Hey, I'm proud of that sauce.
It's delicious.

149
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,954
Oh, my God.

150
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,916
You own an Italian restaurant
and you think that tastes good?

151
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,209
Where are you even from?

152
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,754
Lebanon.

153
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,173
Hand me those tomatoes.

154
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,843
I'm gonna show you what it should
taste like. Come on, hand them to me.

155
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,515
How long is this gonna take?
I got another critic I gotta go yell at.

156
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,816
Ahem. Uh, Joanna,
I wanna talk about that interview.

157
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,235
I thought it went very well.

158
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,865
No, it didn't.
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

159
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,993
Now, just to brief you...

160
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,705
...I may cry.

161
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,627
But they are not tears of sadness
or of anger...

162
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,255
...but just of me having this discussion
with you.

163
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,132
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.

164
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,927
There's nobody here.

165
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,929
Sophie, get in here.

166
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,892
You see?
Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable.

167
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,769
She's not making me uncomfortable.

168
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:49,023
Congratulations, you've just crossed
the line into completely useless. Get out.

169
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,403
Do you want me to quit?

170
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,655
What? What would make you think that?

171
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,159
Well, all of those things you said
in the interview.

172
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,453
If you believe any of them,
I must not be a very good assistant.

173
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,665
You know what?

174
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,586
I am just going to pack up my desk...

175
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,507
...and I will be gone
by the end of the day.

176
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,681
Well, I guess there's no use me
sticking around till the end of the day.

177
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,808
Wait, wait, wait.

178
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,769
You can put your sad little muffin
back in its drawer.

179
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:32,150
If you must know the truth,
I didn't wanna lose a good assistant.

180
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,526
What?

181
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:38,364
That's why I said all those things
about your flirting and your drinking.

182
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,200
My drinking?

183
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,245
Oh. I must have said that after you left.

184
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,956
Said what, exactly?

185
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,917
That you enjoy the occasional drink...

186
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,919
...-ing binge.

187
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,797
Oh, my God. Oh. That is it. I'm leaving.

188
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,301
-You are just a horrible person.
-No, wait, wait, wait.

189
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,387
Now, if you're gonna get
all sensitive about it.

190
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,931
I don't want to lose you.

191
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,642
What if I create a position for you?

192
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,811
I'll make you assistant buyer
in this department.

193
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,732
-Say more things like that.
-Urn....

194
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,527
You can have your own office and a raise,
effective tomorrow.

195
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,906
-I'd need an expense account.
-Done.

196
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,992
-And an assistant.
-Sophie, get in here.

197
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,249
<i>Now it seems like a lifetime, doesn't it?
Starting from....</i>

198
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,000
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

199
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,837
I thought you'd be partying
with Gandoldorf.

200
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,675
It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.

201
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,178
-So you've been sitting here all morning?
-No.

202
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,847
I balanced my checkbook.

203
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,726
Yeah, and I gave first names
to all the foosball players.

204
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,022
I can't believe he didn't come.

205
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,484
So what if he didn't come?
We can still go out and party ourselves.

206
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,321
Oh, no, you know, with Gandalf,
we'd be out all night.

207
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,742
Yeah, we'd meet total strangers
and hang out with them.

208
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,369
Well, we could do that.

209
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,290
There was other stuff too.

210
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,750
We'll do it all, and better.

211
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,712
Look, after tonight,
Gandalf will wanna party with us, dude.

212
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,921
Come on.

213
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,548
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

214
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,882
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

215
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,469
-It's not like we don't know how to party.
-Yeah. All right. Let's go.

216
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,596
And maybe we could end up
on a boat again?

217
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,223
-Yeah!
-All right!

218
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,599
Ah!

219
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,145
Hey, hey, hey. When were we on a boat?

220
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,105
Remember that really cold morning...

221
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,941
...when you woke up
and those dogs were licking your face?

222
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,776
-Yeah.
-Those were seals, man.

223
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,662
Hey, how do you think this suit would look
on an assistant buyer-?

224
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,956
The owner of Allesandro's
came to yell at me...

225
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,335
...but I made him some sauce,
and he offered me the job as head chef.

226
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,544
Oh, my God.

227
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,923
You just ruined the thing I was practicing
the whole way home, but I'm so happy.

228
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,385
Can you believe it?
I finally get to run my own kitchen.

229
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,595
Oh, you've waited so long.

230
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,805
-Ha, ha, oh.
-Oh.

231
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,433
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs. Quick question for you.

232
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,979
How do you think this suit would look
on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?

233
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,941
I don't know. It would totally depend
on her coloring and....

234
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,985
-You got the job!
-Yes!

235
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,030
Oh! You got the job?
Why didn't you tell me?

236
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,328
Oh. It's gonna be so great.
I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell.

237
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,164
I'm gonna have an office
with walls and everything.

238
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,292
-I'm gonna have walls.
-Aw.

239
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,796
Is this the day of good news or what?
I got us a job.

240
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,047
The wedding reception.

241
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,673
Oh.

242
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:47,136
Um, Phoebe,
I kind of need to talk to you about that.

243
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,807
Urn....

244
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,728
Well, I think it might be time for me
to take a step back from the catering.

245
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,648
-But we've only had one job.
-Tsk.

246
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:03,569
I know, but now we have this second one,
and it just feels like it's snowballing.

247
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,197
Yeah, what are you saying?

248
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,700
I got offered the head-chef job
at Allesandro's.

249
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:14,372
-What?
-It's okay, you don't really need me.

250
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,916
You're the cook.

251
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,378
Without you,
it's just me driving up to people's houses...

252
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,547
...with empty trays and asking for money.

253
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,510
All right.

254
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:31,097
But, um, well, I'll pay you back
all the money you invested.

255
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,392
-And you can keep the van.
-For what?

256
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,438
I can't believe this.
I gotta get out of here.

257
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,732
Phoebe, wait a minute.

258
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,363
I'm an assistant buyer!

259
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:55,413
All right, we'll get a little coffee,
get energized, then we'll head back out.

260
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,874
-Yeah, all right.
-Okay.

261
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:05,047
So we're having fun, right?
We don't need that wizard guy.

262
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,217
We hit a couple of clubs,
talked to some strangers...

263
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,929
...then after this, we'll go down
to the docks and see about that boat thing.

264
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,184
I'm kind of beat.

265
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,227
Actually...

266
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,896
...me too.

267
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,063
Are you serious?

268
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,273
Yeah.

269
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,192
Thank God. I'm exhausted.

270
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,945
So you guys want coffees?

271
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,282
Yeah, but I don't wanna be up too late,
so I'll have a decaf.

272
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,242
Yeah, me too.

273
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,829
Actually, could I get some hot water
with a little lemon?

274
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:42,668
I strained my voice screaming in there.
Does it have to be so loud?

275
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,922
Oh. I can't hear a word you're saying,
my ears are ringing so bad.

276
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,675
Huh. I was glad I brought that extra pair
of socks, you know?

277
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,927
I used them as mittens.

278
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,012
I didn't wanna touch a thing
in that last place.

279
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,430
Oh.

280
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,770
How sad are we?

281
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,271
Yeah, I know.

282
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,233
You know what? We're not sad.

283
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,735
We're not sad,
we're just not 21 anymore, you know?

284
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,403
I'm 29 years old, damn it.

285
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,114
I wanna sit in a comfortable chair,
watch television...

286
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,116
...and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.

287
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,451
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

288
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,288
Yeah, and I like to hang out in a quiet place
where I can talk to my friends.

289
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,498
Yeah.

290
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:25,503
And so what if I like to go home,
throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath?

291
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,800
We're 29. We're not women.

292
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,686
Oh. There you are.

293
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,939
Hey, I'm glad that you decided
to hear me out.

294
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,191
Okay, I'm hearing.

295
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,027
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot.

296
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:55,199
And, well, I came up with a whole bunch of
businesses that you can do with your van.

297
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,867
Okay, urn....

298
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,621
-You could be a flower delivery person.
-What?

299
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,915
Or a bakery delivery person.

300
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,334
Pizza?

301
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,920
Monica.

302
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,840
All right, I got a whole bunch of stuff
in this area...

303
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,718
...but I'm getting the feeling
you don't wanna deliver.

304
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,930
-No.
-Okay.

305
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,351
I'm guessing if you don't wanna deliver...

306
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,604
...you probably don't wanna
pick up stuff either.

307
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,315
No.

308
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,820
You know what?

309
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,365
-Let's do the catering business.
-Really? Are you sure?

310
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,328
Yeah. You know,
I made a commitment to you.

311
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,539
-Know what? It'd be fun.
-Oh, it will be fun.

312
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,708
-Oh. Yay!
-Aw.

313
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,919
Okay. Ooh, let's plan
the wedding reception. Okay.

314
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,175
Wow.

315
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,429
You really wanted me
to do something with this van.

316
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,020
You know what?
I want you to take the chef job.

317
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,023
-Really?
-Yeah.

318
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,317
That's what you really want.

319
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,736
Yeah, I don't wanna be the reason
you're unhappy.

320
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,196
That would make me unhappy.

321
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,407
And I really don't wanna be the reason
I'm unhappy.

322
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,160
Thank you.

323
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,083
Besides, it might be kind of fun
to form the new A-Team.

324
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,095
Oh, hi, Mrs. Lynch. Is Joanna in already?

325
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,972
Oh, my goodness. You haven't heard.

326
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,641
Heard what?

327
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,977
Joanna passed away last night.

328
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,814
Oh, my God. How?

329
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,900
Well, she was leaving work,
and she was hit by a cab.

330
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,945
Oh, my God. Oh, I cannot believe it.

331
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,365
-I know.
-Oh, God.

332
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,617
Oh, God.

333
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,620
Oh, God.

334
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,998
I didn't realize that you were so close.

335
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,752
Yes. So close.

336
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:19,510
Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional
and difficult time for all of us.

337
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:23,514
But by any chance, did Joanna
send any paperwork your way...

338
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,642
...before it happened?

339
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,145
No, nothing.

340
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,941
Imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb
a few seconds later....

341
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:39,071
Oh. Yes, yes, just a few seconds
and she'd still be with us.

342
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,657
Nothing about an assistant buyer?

343
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,535
I'm sorry. I have to go.

344
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:47,997
Good morning.

345
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:51,125
Oh, Sophie,
I guess you didn't hear about Joanna.

346
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,793
I sure did.

347
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,844
I'm so excited about having Monica
come onboard with us.

348
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,848
Although I do feel bad
about having fired Chef Emilio.

349
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,768
It is like losing a member of the family.

350
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,105
Of course, that literally is the case
for several of you.

351
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,359
Tony, Carlos, Marie...

352
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:21,572
...please tell your father
how much we're going to miss him.

353
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:27,411
Now, I know that Monica
has a lot of great ideas for this place.

354
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,498
Well, you all read the review. Ha, ha.

355
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,000
So without much further ado...

356
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:37,296
...I present to you our new head chef.

357
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:48,224
Um, I just wanna say, uh,
that with a pinch of excitement...

358
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,727
...a dash of hard work,
and a dollop of cooperation...

359
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,854
...we can have the recipe....

360
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,568
Are you going to kill me?
