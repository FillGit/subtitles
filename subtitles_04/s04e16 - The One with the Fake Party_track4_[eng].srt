1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,631
What is it?

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,050
Nothing. I can't find anything
that I want to eat.

3
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,551
Everything makes me nauseous.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,554
I'm telling you, being pregnant
is no piece of cake. Oh, cake.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,766
No.

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,894
-Aw, honey, I'm sorry.
-God.

7
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:23,732
Ooh, what is that smell?
It's coming from the bathroom.

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,152
Wow, pregnancy does give you
some weird cravings.

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,863
-Yeah.
-It's me. It's Phoebe.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,991
Listen, there's something in here
I want to eat. What...?

11
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,119
What smells so good?

12
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,373
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,749
No.

14
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,918
-Ugh.
-Oh, wait, wait.

15
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,963
Is it my bologna sandwich?

16
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,175
Yes, yes, yes.

17
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,345
I can't believe it. The baby wants bologna.
The baby wants me to eat meat.

18
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:56,265
-I can't eat meat.
-Uh, wait, wait.

19
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,059
Maybe it's the pickle.

20
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,529
What are you writing?

21
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,156
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow...

22
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,867
...and since I don't have the guts
to ask him out...

23
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,703
...I'm gonna sell him a coat
and put this note in the pocket.

24
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,330
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh.

25
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:05,751
"Joshua, give me a call sometime.
Guys like you...

26
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,337
...never go out of style."

27
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,506
What did you throw away?

28
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,553
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, what have you guys been up to?

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,807
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian
doorknobs at the Cooper-Hewitt museum.

30
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,434
Without me?

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,230
My uncle dragged us there,
but actually it turned out to be interesting.

32
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,733
-Yeah.
-They were so ornate and beautiful.

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,942
I mean, look at that.

34
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,778
I don't know how museums work
in England...

35
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,530
...but here,
you're not supposed to take stuff.

36
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,450
I, uh- I got it from the gift shop.

37
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,494
They have really lax security there.

38
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,664
It's a joke.

39
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,375
Bye.

40
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,296
Right, I've got to be off. I'll see you.
Bye-bye, then.

41
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,131
Bye.

42
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,301
Wow. Hey, you guys seem
to be having a good time.

43
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,764
Oh, yeah, she is amazing,
and she's so much fun.

44
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,643
And you know what?
When I'm with her, I'm fun.

45
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,897
I even signed up for helicopter classes.

46
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,317
She's leaving in two days.
I don't have to do it.

47
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,737
-Aw, two days? You must be bummed.
-Yeah.

48
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,489
She's got to go back to London.

49
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,325
But you know what?
I've been prepared for this from the start.

50
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:24,037
We both knew we had two weeks
together and then that's it, you know?

51
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,790
Hey, that's what all
my relationships are like.

52
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,919
Yes, but in Ross' case,
they both know in two weeks that's it.

53
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,090
Pheebs, hey.

54
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,843
-Hello, hello.
-Yeah, I know. Yeah.

55
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,055
So the baby is totally craving meat.

56
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,765
This afternoon, I tried tricking it.

57
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,810
I made it a soy burger
so that maybe it'd think it was getting meat.

58
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,187
You know? And I got nauseous.

59
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,524
Well, maybe that's because
soy burgers suck.

60
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,777
Being pregnant is hard on your tummy.

61
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,822
Hey, but at least you got
that cool, pregnant-lady glow.

62
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,284
Oh, that's sweat. You throw up all morning,
you'll have that glow too.

63
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,795
-Okay.
-Uh, here's that trench coat you wanted.

64
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,839
Oh, great. Great.

65
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,800
-Wow, yeah, it's comfortable.
-Yeah.

66
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,304
Man, you could really
flash somebody in this thing.

67
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,056
Ha, ha. They don't want you to put
your hands in the pockets...

68
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,350
...until you are out of the store.

69
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,478
Why not?

70
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,480
Well, because...

71
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,899
...we get a lot of—

72
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,903
You know, they ruin it for everybody.

73
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,446
I know.

74
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,073
You know, I wore that cashmere sweater
on a date last night.

75
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:46,244
-Oh.
-It was the first date since the divorce.

76
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,332
Well, congratulations.
So do you love her?

77
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,752
No, no, no. She's nice,
but, you know, it made me realize...

78
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,005
...I'm just not ready to be dating,
you know?

79
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,382
Huh.

80
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,927
Well, uh....

81
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,179
That's, uh- That's interesting.

82
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,722
Hey, whoa, hey.

83
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,934
-What was that?
-Oh, that's just an antitheft device.

84
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,311
Then what's this?

85
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,732
Well, you need that too, because
obviously a thief could just tear this up.

86
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,656
Listen, we have to have a party tonight.

87
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,867
We have to have one in five minutes,
so everybody cancel your plans.

88
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,245
-What?
-Yeah, what's going on?

89
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,498
We have to have a surprise
bon-voyage party for Emily.

90
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,875
But it's actually for Joshua.

91
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,295
Look, he said he's not ready to date.

92
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,632
So I had to invite him to a party
if I wanted to see him outside work.

93
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:45,637
And now I have created
the perfect opportunity to seduce him.

94
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,641
Well, as much as I'd like
to meet Josh and warn him...

95
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,562
...Emily and I aren't gonna be here,
all right?

96
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,689
She's gonna come by first
to say goodbye.

97
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,943
And then I've got a whole special
evening planned. So sorry. No party.

98
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,736
Aw.

99
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,532
-Hello?
-Surprise!

100
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,785
Surprise!

101
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,039
No one's ever thrown me
a surprise party before.

102
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,167
Well, it was all Ross' idea.

103
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,838
You're so sweet.

104
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,299
And I'm so surprised.

105
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,929
You really didn't know?

106
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,438
<i>There's dancin'</i>

107
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,106
<i>Behind movie scenes</i>

108
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,067
Why are you over here
if Joshua's all the way over there?

109
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,987
Uh, because I'm trying to play
hard-to-get.

110
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,074
Oh, quick. He's looking over here.
Say something funny.

111
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,285
-Like what?
-Ha-ha-ha.

112
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,496
What's so funny?

113
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,541
I said, "Like what?"

114
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,337
Now that's a thinker.

115
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,424
Okay, you know what? This
playing-hard-to-get thing is not working.

116
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,594
Uh, hand me those cherries. Okay.

117
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,928
Okay.

118
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,809
-Hi.
-Hey.

119
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,312
-Care for a cherry?
-No, thanks.

120
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,691
You know, I can tie one of these into a knot
using just my tongue.

121
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,206
You okay?

122
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,249
You all right?

123
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,465
So we should probably get going soon.

124
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,301
Oh, but the party's only
just getting started.

125
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,097
Yeah, but we have to be at The Four
Seasons for drinks in, oh, 15 minutes.

126
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,474
And then, uh, you know,
then the Plaza for dinner.

127
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,394
So why did you plan a party
at the same time?

128
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,605
No, no, no. Ha, ha.

129
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:06,486
Actually, American surprise parties
are very short.

130
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,991
It's usually, "Surprise!" Then,
"Oh, my God, I'm so surprised. Goodbye."

131
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,370
Ross, I'm having such a great time.

132
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:19,249
Your sister has just been telling me that
you used to dressed up like old ladies...

133
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,876
...and host make-believe tea parties.

134
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,674
Monica said that, did she?

135
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,928
Oh, yeah. Then what are you going
to put on top of that?

136
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,432
-A little salami.
-Ooh, yeah. Yeah.

137
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,977
Then, um, what goes on top
of the salami?

138
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,563
-Pastrami.
-Oh, yeah.

139
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,609
You're a genius.

140
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,989
Can someone give me a hand
with the zipper.

141
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,118
Up.

142
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,541
-You changed?
-Yeah, I just needed my lucky dress.

143
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,335
-And "lucky" means "more cleavage"?
-Does for me.

144
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,016
Oh, God, look at him. He's so cute.

145
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,852
I just want to go over there and grab him
and kiss him.

146
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,480
How could I kiss him
without letting him know that I like him?

147
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,900
Hey, I know how you can get him.
Take off your bra.

148
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,860
What?

149
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,070
-There was a scene in <i>Footloose-
-Flashdance.</i>

150
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,824
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah, with that plumber girl?
-She was a welder.

151
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,162
Were you, like, in the movie?

152
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,709
Anyway, she takes off her bra
under the shirt...

153
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,419
...and pulls it out the sleeve.

154
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,130
Very sexy. And classy.

155
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,553
Or if you wanna kiss him,
urn, you could use mistletoe.

156
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,805
It's not Christmas.

157
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,807
-Or spin the bottle.
-And he's not 11.

158
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,688
Thank you so much for this.
It was really so thoughtful of you.

159
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,106
You're leaving?

160
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,110
-Yes, we have something we have to get to.
-Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna take off too.

161
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,197
No, you guys, you can't leave yet.
You have to stay.

162
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,033
We've got the whole big thing planned.

163
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,743
What big thing?

164
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,037
So, Spin-The-Bottle
works like this.

165
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,705
I spin the bottle.

166
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,625
Lands on Gunther,
so I would have to kiss Gunther.

167
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,419
All right.

168
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,464
Who wants to go first?

169
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,924
I'll go.

170
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,265
Welcome to America.

171
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,643
Oh.

172
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,020
All right.

173
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,523
Oh, my God.

174
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,360
Oh, my gosh. Two in a row.
You gotta use your tongues now.

175
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,784
All right.

176
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,121
What are the odds? What are the odds?

177
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,542
Okay, that's enough, you know. Ha, ha.

178
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,753
Let's let someone else play.

179
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,924
Hey, if you didn't want to play,
then why'd you come to the party?

180
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,428
Okay, my turn.

181
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,683
Oh! Look at that.

182
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,476
Oh, my God.

183
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,732
Oh, my God. The baby just kicked.

184
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,944
It's okay, it's okay.
If it kicked once, it'll kick again.

185
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:43,286
All right, well, everybody just remember
where they were sitting.

186
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,047
It was a bug.

187
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,593
It doesn't matter
how much I'm craving it.

188
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,222
You know why I'm never gonna eat meat?
Because it's cold-blooded murder.

189
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,557
Okay.

190
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,357
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich.

191
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,526
Phoebe, what are you doing?

192
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,946
I can't help it.

193
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,032
I need the meat.
The baby needs the meat.

194
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,242
You know how when
you're dating someone...

195
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,996
...and you don't want to cheat on them
unless it's with someone really hot?

196
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,001
-Yeah, totally.
-All right, okay.

197
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,753
Well, this is the same kind of deal.

198
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,673
If you're gonna do something wrong...

199
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,384
...do it right.

200
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,642
Feel better?

201
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,978
Yeah, but at what cost?

202
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,981
Six more months, three meals a day?

203
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:57,110
I'm gonna eat like, you know,
millions of cows.

204
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,573
Hey, what if I said I could even things out
for you, meat-wise?

205
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,951
-What?
-Well, I eat a lot of meat, right?

206
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,037
-Yeah.
-But suppose, until the baby's born...

207
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,414
...I laid off it.

208
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,959
No extra animals would die.
You'd just be eating my animals.

209
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,504
Joey, I can't believe
you'd do that for me.

210
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,675
Absolutely. I could be a vegetarian.

211
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,344
There's no meat in beer, right?

212
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,431
Okay, we can still make dinner
if we skip the appetizers...

213
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,766
...and ask for our check right away.

214
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,982
We can't go now. Looks like Rachel
is going to put on a skit.

215
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,778
Oh, my God. Have you lost your mind?

216
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,282
No, no, no. I am finally thinking clearly.

217
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,202
My lucky dress wasn't working out
too well for me.

218
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,789
But for four years,
this baby never missed.

219
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,001
Rachel, wait, I can't let—

220
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,462
Actually, I kind of want to see
what happens.

221
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,132
-Hey.
-Hey.

222
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,217
Nice, uh, costume.

223
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,677
Oh, yeah.

224
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:09,182
Well, I wanted to give Emily
a big American goodbye cheer.

225
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,602
So okay. Whoo!

226
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,065
Ready. Okay.

227
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,858
-Give me an "E."
-E.

228
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,651
-Give me an "M."
-M.

229
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,445
-Give me an "I."
-I.

230
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,780
-Give me an "L"
-L.

231
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,615
-Give me a "Y."
-Y.

232
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,617
What do you get?

233
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,161
Oh! Emily.

234
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,163
Whoo! Emily.

235
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,377
Okay. That's me as a cheerleader. Ta-da!

236
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,256
-You all right?
-I just loosened a tooth.

237
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,300
It's no big deal. I have a dentist, you know?

238
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,220
I'm gonna go put some ice on it.
Excuse me.

239
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,849
-What do I do now? What do I do now?
-I think you're done.

240
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,144
Okay, time to take off the bra.

241
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,318
Uh, that was really great.

242
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,946
But I got to take off, actually.

243
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,074
Take the bra off.

244
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,329
All right, come on,
let's go get your coat.

245
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,622
Okay.

246
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,376
Rachel's my girlfriend.

247
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,382
So this was really fun.

248
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,259
Oh, yeah, it was real fun.

249
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,307
You know, this bra...

250
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,271
...is really bothering me.

251
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,482
You know, this used to be my bedroom.

252
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,151
Yeah.

253
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:47,697
A lot of memories in here. Lot of memories.

254
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,241
If these walls could talk,
you know what they'd say?

255
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,743
"Want to hear some memories?"

256
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,585
Need a-? Need a little hand there?

257
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,795
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I got this all under control.

258
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,300
You really don't seem like you do.

259
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,726
God. Forget it! Oh, this is-

260
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,106
This is not how
this was supposed to happen.

261
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,691
What was supposed to happen?

262
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,612
Can you not look at me when I say this?

263
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,369
I thought that if I could get you here...

264
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,748
...I could seduce you.

265
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:48,299
Uh, I don't wear suits to work...

266
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,010
...and I bought six of them from you.

267
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,931
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought you needed them.

268
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,519
My point is, I kept coming back
because I wanted to see you.

269
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,856
-Why?
-Because I like you.

270
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,567
You like me?

271
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,110
Yeah.

272
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:13,032
I mean, you're beautiful
and smart and sophisticated.

273
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,326
A lot of this isn't, you know,
based on tonight.

274
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,664
But you like me?

275
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,001
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
All this time, I liked you and you liked me.

276
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,211
Oh!

277
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,047
-But-
-No don't say "but."

278
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,677
"But" is never good. Let's leave it
at "I like you and you like me."

279
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,137
Okay, uh....

280
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,140
-However—
-No, that's a fancy "but."

281
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,480
My marriage, like, just ended.

282
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:48,859
And I'm really not ready
to get into anything yet.

283
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,779
But....

284
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:57,118
I'm sorry. I just need a little time.

285
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,456
Okay.

286
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,338
Oh, there you are.
I was looking for you before.

287
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,550
Joshua's gone,
so you and Emily are free to go.

288
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,468
It's okay.

289
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,513
She's still in there
enjoying her fake party.

290
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,809
And, uh, it's too late to do
any of the stuff I had planned, so....

291
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,186
Ross.

292
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,606
I'm sorry.
I completely ruined your evening.

293
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,649
Ahem. Yeah.

294
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:34,238
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I made a fool of myself.

295
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,074
Helps a little.

296
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,038
Is there a room on that step
for a pathetic loser?

297
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,206
Yeah, have a seat.

298
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,715
I'm so sorry.

299
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:53,924
It's okay.

300
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,094
I mean, it was just a two-week thing
anyway.

301
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,722
I just didn't want it to end this way,
you know.

302
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,308
Or maybe you didn't want it to end?

303
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,144
What do you mean?

304
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,730
You seem to really like her.

305
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,776
Yeah, I really do.

306
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,029
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?

307
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,782
We both agreed it was gonna be
a two-week thing.

308
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,784
You know? No commitment.

309
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,079
Ross?

310
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:28,918
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...

311
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,671
...asking to hear stories about you...

312
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,423
...looking through
Monica's photo albums.

313
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,676
I mean, you don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

314
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,970
You think?

315
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,893
You've got, like, 14 hours
until she has to be at the airport.

316
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,521
And you're sitting here in a hallway...

317
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,899
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

318
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,780
-Hey, you're right.
-Yeah.

319
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,036
Thanks.

320
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,376
What photo album was it?

321
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,921
I don't know. It was you
and a bunch of albino kids.

322
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,760
Oh, my God. Those weren't albino kids.

323
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,012
That was computer camp. Rach.

324
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,768
-Hey.
-Hey.

325
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,439
-You're a pathetic loser, right?
-Oh, yeah.

326
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,816
Sit.

327
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,198
Hi.

328
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,826
Oh, my God. Joshua.

329
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,703
Look.

330
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,290
All those things I said
about not being ready-

331
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,042
-They're not true?
-No, they're all true.

332
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,502
Oh.

333
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:55,880
But....

334
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,339
Oh.

335
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,760
Oh, I love that "but."

336
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,647
Um, do you want to go inside
and get some coffee?

337
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,858
-Yeah.
-Okay.

338
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,034
Every time.

339
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,708
-Ooh, what do you got there?
-Pastrami.

340
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,668
Yeah.

341
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,839
-Hey, you know what goes good with that?
-Mm-hm. Corned beef.

342
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,719
Ooh, I was going to say bologna.
But that's better.

343
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,389
-How about a little of that smoked turkey?
-Okay.

344
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,227
Oh, Mama.

345
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,022
-When is the baby due?
-Six months.

346
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,776
Hey, now, if a cow should die
of natural causes...

347
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,028
...I could have one of those, right?

348
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,280
Not if I get there first.
