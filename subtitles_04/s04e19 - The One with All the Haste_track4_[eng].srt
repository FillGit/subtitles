00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:11,678
<i>Morning's here</i>

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,097
<i>The morning's here</i>

3
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,683
<i>Sunshine is here</i>

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,310
<i>The sky is clear</i>

5
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,938
<i>The morning's here</i>

6
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,272
<i>The morning's here</i>

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,774
Hey!

8
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,529
Do you have to do that?
It's Saturday!

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,531
Oh, come on!

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,449
Morning's here!

11
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:36,161
<i>Morning's here</i>

12
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,539
<i>The morning's here</i>

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>Sunshine is here</i>

14
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,421
I hate this apartment!

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52,094
I hate the color of these walls!
I hate that this place still smells like bird!

16
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,014
I hate that singing guy!

17
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,601
Are you kidding? I love that guy!

18
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,188
<i>Morning's here, morning is-</i>

19
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,148
Stop it!

20
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,567
I will kill you.

21
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,739
I hate that my room is so small.

22
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,617
I have all the space I need.
Just do what I did.

23
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,663
Monica, you don't even have a bed.
You sleep in a ball on the floor!

24
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,750
You know what?
I am tired of your bellyaching.

25
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,254
I've worked really hard at making this
a nice place for us to live.

26
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,715
I know. I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,758
I'm sorry, okay?

28
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,260
This is a great apartment.

29
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,345
Shut up. This place is a hole.

30
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,154
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe
you've got an earring!

31
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,407
I know, I know.
Who am I? David Bowie?

32
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,827
He does that?

33
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,080
-I don't know. Whatever.
-Ha, ha.

34
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,291
Well, I think it makes you look
really dangerous.

35
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,752
-Oh, I know.
-Ha-ha-ha.

36
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,545
You know what?

37
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,548
I never would've gotten this
if it weren't for you.

38
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,260
No, really. When I'm with you, I'm like...

39
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,180
...this whole other guy.
I love that guy!

40
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,516
I mean, I love you too. A lot.

41
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,935
But that guy!

42
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,520
I love that guy!

43
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,522
-I love both of you.
-Ah, heh.

44
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,694
I wish I didn't have to go.

45
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,779
Then don't.

46
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,657
Stay here. Don't go so soon to London.

47
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,200
-Just one more day.
-Oh, Ross.

48
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,619
-One more day.
-Please don't do this to me again.

49
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:27,499
You know I'd stay, but I've already missed
so much work. They'll fire me.

50
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,877
So? Then you could stay
as long as you want.

51
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,296
I wish I could.

52
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,467
Oh, no, don't- Don't-
Don't start packing.

53
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,428
Come on.

54
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,974
I don't think you understand packing.

55
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,103
I don't want to leave it
till the last minute.

56
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,897
Last time I packed in a rush,
I left my knickers here.

57
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,984
Yeah, I know. I, uh, tried them on.

58
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,027
You didn't!

59
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,738
No, I didn't.
I didn't want to be "that guy."

60
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,458
Hello.

61
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,294
Ho, ho, ho.

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,423
-Excuse me?
-Your pants.

63
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,842
Oh, yeah! You like them?

64
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,471
I went to a used-clothes store
and got maternity stuff.

65
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,515
These are so comfortable.

66
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,605
Uh, Pheebs, those are,
uh, Santa pants.

67
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,900
-What?
-Santa pants.

68
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,611
Santa Claus' pants.

69
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,448
Nuh-uh. They're maternity pants.

70
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,993
They even came with
a list of baby names. See?

71
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,246
These names are good,
and these are bad.

72
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,750
Oh.

73
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,586
-Hey!
-Hey.

74
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,046
Hey, Pheebs.

75
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,882
So, how are the elves?

76
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:04,387
I don't know.
How are the, uh, you know?

77
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,016
Your clothes aren't funny.

78
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,145
Hey, guys,
what should I wear to a Knicks game?

79
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,148
Uh, a T-shirt that says,
"I Don't Belong Here"?

80
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,485
You have tickets?

81
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:23,031
Mom got Dad's season tickets in
the divorce, so she gave them to me.

82
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,408
Apparently, they're good seats.

83
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,953
Oh, my God!
Those are almost on the floor!

84
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,829
Do you guys want these?

85
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,374
-Yeah!
-Yeah, we do!

86
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,292
Well, you got them!

87
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,670
-All right!
-Just give us our apartment back.

88
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,717
Whoa, I didn't see that coming.

89
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,637
Are you serious?

90
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,599
Come on. We know what these are worth.

91
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,851
Do you think we're stupid?

92
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,397
Not stupid. You're meaner
than I thought.

93
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,941
-What do you say?
-Forget it.

94
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:02,028
Okay? I'm not giving up my
bachelor pad for basketball seats.

95
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,614
Your "bachelor pad"?

96
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,783
Have you even had a girl here?

97
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,954
No.

98
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,208
But Joey has, and I usually
talk to them in the morning time.

99
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,170
Yeah, you do.

100
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,887
Come on!

101
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,223
Gunther, can I get
two cups of chino, please?

102
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,808
Good one.

103
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,686
Come on. Season tickets.

104
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,063
Season tickets!
You know what that means?

105
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,274
Forget it.
I'm not giving up the apartment.

106
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:43,194
When I was a kid, my dad's company
gave season tickets...

107
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:48,283
...to the Number 1 salesman every year.
All right? My dad never won.

108
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,621
Of course, he wasn't in sales.
But still, I never forgot that!

109
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,790
-Hey guys!
-Hey.

110
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,127
Oh, my God.

111
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,213
We don't make enough
fun of you already?

112
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,759
Oh, yeah. Emily convinced me to do it.

113
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,095
You do know that Wham broke up?

114
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,723
Ah! Ha, ha.

115
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,518
I like it. And Emily likes it.
And that's what counts.

116
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,731
So, uh, how are you guys doing?

117
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:23,318
Don't try and talk all normal
with that thing in your ear.

118
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,862
Where's Emily?

119
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,198
Ugh, she's saying goodbye
to her uncle.

120
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,077
-Didn't she, like, just get here?
-Yeah! Yeah.

121
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,411
Easy, tiger.

122
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,039
I just hate this so much.

123
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:40,126
Every time I go pick her up at
the airport, it's so great.

124
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:45,131
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back
in a couple of days, dropping her off."

125
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,884
-So, what'll you do?
-There's nothing to do.

126
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,761
She lives there. I live here.

127
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,597
She'd have to move here.

128
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,474
She should move here.

129
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,476
What?

130
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,145
-I can ask her to live with me.
-Are you serious?

131
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,565
-Why not? I mean, why not?
-You've only known her six weeks!

132
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,778
I've got a carton of milk in my fridge
I've had a longer relationship with.

133
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,032
Look, guys, when I'm with her,
it's like....

134
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,036
Uh, she brings out this great side of me.

135
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,622
I mean, I love her, you know?

136
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,749
And I love the milk!

137
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,878
But I won't ask some British girl
to move in with me.

138
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,802
Joey, you say things now.

139
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,806
Look, Ross. He's right.
Emily's great.

140
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,266
She's great!

141
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,185
But this is too soon.
You're only gonna scare her.

142
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,521
-I don't wanna do that.
-No.

143
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,816
You don't want to wreck it.
Don't go too fast.

144
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,652
No. You're right.
I know, you're right.

145
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,654
I'm not going to do it.

146
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,366
-Thanks guys.
-No problem.

147
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,827
Just remember to wake us up
before you go-go.

148
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,924
It's too hard. Too hard!

149
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,678
All right, boys.
Last chance for the tickets.

150
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,432
Otherwise, I give them to my
new boyfriend, Joshua.

151
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,643
No, thank you.

152
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,230
Wait, wait. Come on, come on!
Let's trade.

153
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,858
The timing's perfect!
I just clogged the toilet!

154
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:34,032
I want those seats as much as you.
But we can't live in the small apartment...

155
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,118
...after we've lived here!
Ever read <i>Flowers for Algernon?</i>

156
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,995
Yes.

157
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,080
Ever read <i>Sports Illustrated?</i>

158
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,168
No, I didn't read yours!

159
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,920
We can go to the game tonight!

160
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,672
The only way I'll consider this...

161
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,133
...is if they offer more
than just season seats.

162
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,760
-It's the Knicks!
-Screw the Knicks.

163
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,553
Whoa!

164
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,602
I didn't mean that. I just meant...

165
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,772
...that the apartment is worth
so much more.

166
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,149
Huh.

167
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,985
And the Knicks rule all.

168
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,612
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!

169
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,949
Hey, so? Are you going to do it?

170
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,411
No, we're not going to
because it's not an even trade.

171
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,704
All right, look.

172
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,916
What if you could keep the apartment
and the tickets?

173
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,126
Done!

174
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:30,296
Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet.
Winner takes all.

175
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,714
Ooh, we could get nothing.

176
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,801
-Or you can end up with everything.
-Oh, I like that.

177
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,512
What do you say?

178
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,514
-No!
-Just do it!

179
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,307
Oh! Oh, I'm convinced!

180
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,646
Come on, man!
You know I'd do it for you.

181
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,149
Because you're my best friend.

182
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,570
All right. But you can't
use that again for a whole year.

183
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,446
I'm in.

184
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,576
This is so exciting!
What are you going to bet?

185
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,786
Okay. Well, we should
let Phoebe decide...

186
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:06,040
...because she's the only one
who's impartial, and she's so pretty.

187
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,169
Okay. Ha, ha. Um....

188
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,379
Ooh, ooh. Oh, I have a game!

189
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,173
-This is great!
-Okay. What's the game?

190
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,760
Um, well, it doesn't have a name.
No, okay. Phoebe Ball!

191
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,223
No, it doesn't have a name. Urn-

192
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,475
Okay, Monica.

193
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,396
What is your favorite thing
about trees?

194
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,859
-They're green?
-Good! Good, five points!

195
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,240
All right, Joey....

196
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,326
Same question.

197
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,786
Uh....

198
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,873
-Oh! Heh. They're tall.
-Ooh, three points.

199
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,963
Both fine answers, but we were
looking for leafy. Leafy.

200
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,717
That's not even a game.

201
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,969
Shut up. We're winning!

202
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,349
You want to finish this?
We get a deck of cards.

203
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,226
High card wins.
What do you say?

204
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,311
-Let's do it!
-Oh, I have cards!

205
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,480
-Oh, good.
-Yeah. Here.

206
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,148
No, these are the trick deck.

207
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,651
Okay. Here, yes.

208
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,818
-Ahem.
-Okay.

209
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,403
Okay, you guys, uh, you pick first.

210
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,030
-Okay.
-Okay?

211
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,786
-Four.
-That's a low one!

212
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,329
Okay.

213
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,291
Phoebe, you look. I can't do it.

214
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,336
-What makes you think I can?
-That's okay.

215
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,504
Ace!

216
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,010
Why are you hugging?

217
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,929
Because we won our apartment back!

218
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,266
What? Ace is high!
Jack, queen, king, ace!

219
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,185
No! Ace is low!
Ace, two, three, four!

220
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,278
I don't know.

221
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,698
Ooh! Oh.

222
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,075
Look it! Aah!

223
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,247
-All right, come on, pick again!
-Okay, give me.

224
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,165
-Okay.
-Okay.

225
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,960
Come on, apartment!
Come on, apartment!

226
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,590
Aah! I know queen is high!

227
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,175
Not as high as....

228
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,803
It worked! King!

229
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,933
We pick again!
We pick again!

230
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,601
-Why?
-I don't know.

231
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,273
-Tickets, please.
-Ugh!

232
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,319
-That's courtside, baby!
-Yeah, ha, ha.

233
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,238
Seriously, good game, though.
Good game.

234
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,452
What are they so mad about?
They got the apartment back.

235
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,620
No, they didn't.

236
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,380
Hey.

237
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,008
Packed while you were gone.

238
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,635
I left some knickers under your pillow.

239
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,181
Move in with me.

240
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,891
What?

241
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:14,771
Don't be scared. It sounds crazy,
and people will say it's too soon...

242
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:19,817
...but just think.
Think how great it would be.

243
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,195
Oh....

244
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,988
I don't know.

245
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,700
Uh, oh, leaving London.

246
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,786
-My whole family lives there....
-I know.

247
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,914
-My job.
-You'll get a job here.

248
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:37,126
I always hear about them foreigners
stealing American jobs.

249
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,337
That could be you.

250
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,131
Yeah, but it's my whole life.

251
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,883
You come to England.

252
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,095
I can't. I would. I really would.
But my son is here.

253
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,265
I can't leave him.
You don't think there's any way?

254
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,268
Oh, I don't think so.

255
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,273
It would be different if it was
way into the future...

256
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,943
...and we were getting married
or something.

257
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,194
What?

258
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:07,156
Uh, no, right.
I shouldn't have said "married."

259
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,033
Uh, please don't go freaky on me.

260
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,620
I didn't mean it.
I didn't say it. I take it back.

261
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,122
No. Don't.

262
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,292
Why don't we?

263
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,503
Why don't we what?

264
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,006
Get married.

265
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,551
You are mad!

266
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:31,639
No, I'm not! It's perfect.
It's better than you moving here.

267
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,934
It's us together forever,
and that's what I want.

268
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,687
-We've known each other six weeks!
-Yeah, I know.

269
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,649
So what? Who's to say?
Does that mean we can't do it?

270
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:46,028
Look. I was with Carol for
four years before we got married...

271
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,449
...and I wound up divorced
from a pregnant lesbian.

272
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,411
I mean, this....

273
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,539
This makes sense for us.

274
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:02,336
Come on. Our first date, we ended up
spending the whole weekend in Vermont.

275
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,715
I mean, last night
I got my ear pierced. Me!

276
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,968
This feels right.

277
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:10,887
Doesn't it?

278
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,016
My parents are gonna be really mad.

279
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,977
Is that--? Are you saying "Yes"?
Is that "Yes"?

280
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,396
Yes.

281
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,609
-Yes!
-Yes?

282
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,944
-We're getting married!
-Oh, my God!

283
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,406
-Yes! Ha, ha.
-We're getting married!

284
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,241
Come here, come here.

285
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,749
Ow!

286
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,170
Emily, will you marry me?

287
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,256
Yes.

288
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,720
Oh, it's a bit small.

289
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,933
Damn! I thought that'd be
romantic as hell.

290
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,437
It was.

291
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,204
-Those were, like, the best seats ever.
-Oh, yeah.

292
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,958
Hey, should we give these to the girls?
Like a peace offering?

293
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,419
That's very nice.
Plus, they were free and too small.

294
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,468
Oh, God.

295
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,518
Hey, you want a beer?

296
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,565
-Whoa!
-I know!

297
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,153
Open up! Open up! Open up!

298
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,574
We'll discuss it in the morning.

299
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,250
What the hell is going on?

300
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,920
We took our apartment back!

301
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,217
I had nothing to do with it.

302
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:20,308
Okay, it was my idea.
But I don't feel good about it.

303
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,518
Oh, oh!

304
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,106
We are switching back right now.

305
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,191
No, we're not. We're not leaving!

306
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,319
You'll have to. You both have jobs.

307
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,156
As soon as you do, we're switching back!
There's nothing you can do to stop us.

308
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:36,741
Right, Joe?

309
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,950
I don't know.

310
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,039
What?

311
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,958
I don't want to move again, with....

312
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,838
I don't care! This is our apartment
and they stole-

313
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,257
You stole!

314
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,552
Our apartment!
We won it fair and square. Twice!

315
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,556
And I am getting it back right now!
I'm getting it back right now!

316
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,601
All right.

317
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:08,856
We figured you might respond
this way, so we have a backup offer.

318
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,068
Oh, no more offers.
You can't offer anything to us!

319
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:16,614
-Let us keep the apartment and-
-As a thank you...

320
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,411
...Rachel and I will kiss
for one minute.

321
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,627
-Totally worth it.
-That was one good minute.

322
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,712
-Good night.
-Good night.

323
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,428
-Men are such idiots.
-I know.

324
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:44,266
Can you believe something that stupid
actually got us our apartment back?

325
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,728
It's funny. If you had just done that
after the last contest...

326
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,106
...no one would have
had to move at all. Ha, ha.

327
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,986
-Let's pretend that's not true.
-Yeah.

328
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,449
Okay. Scarf's done.

329
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,497
-Come on. Come on, come on!
-Okay.

330
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,874
-Hey!
-Hey.

331
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,084
What's going on?

332
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,294
Ross has some big thing
to tell everyone.

333
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,879
Uh....

334
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,841
Well, okay. It's, uh- Ahem.

335
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,593
Emily and I, we decided to, uh...

336
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,595
...to get married.

337
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,808
-What?
-Oh, my God.

338
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,394
Oh, are you pregnant too?

339
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,939
No.

340
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,109
When did-? How did you-?

341
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:38,154
We just decided to go for it.

342
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,490
We know it's a bit hasty, but, uh...

343
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,826
...it just feels so right.

344
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,749
Um, I was just telling the guys-

345
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,002
Yeah, I heard.

346
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,635
I think it's great! Aah!

347
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,262
I'm so happy for you!

348
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,847
Well, yeah! Congratulations!

349
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,525
-I can't believe you're getting married!
-Yeah.

350
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,615
Monica and Rachel made out.

351
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:37,296
<i>Morning's here</i>

352
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,132
<i>The morning's here</i>

353
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,843
<i>Sunshine is here</i>

354
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,553
<i>The sky is clear</i>

355
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,223
<i>The morning's here</i>

356
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,599
-Hey, you're back!
-Hey!

357
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,770
<i>-Get into gear
-Breakfast is near</i>

358
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:58,067
<i>The dark of night has disappeared</i>

359
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,779
-I'll see you tomorrow morning!
-Okay!
