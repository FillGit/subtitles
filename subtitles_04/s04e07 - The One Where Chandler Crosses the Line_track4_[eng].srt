1
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,340
I just saw Kathy naked.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,383
It was like torture.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,013
If we go to war and you're captured,
you're in for a surprise.

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,516
It keeps getting worse.

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:19,019
I'm in love with
my roommate's girlfriend.

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:24,191
Every time we're in the same room,
there's weird energy between us.

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,152
Call me crazy, but
I think she likes me too.

8
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,614
And now I have seen her naked.

9
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,492
At least with her clothes on...

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,037
...I could imagine her body
was covered in boils.

11
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,750
But there are no boils.
She's smooth.

12
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,253
Smooth!

13
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,382
Wow....

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,342
Could you see up his robe?

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,886
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

16
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,730
-Here you go.
-I'll call you.

17
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,981
Great.

18
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,609
Hey, hey. Who was that?

19
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,112
Casey. We're going out tonight.

20
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,906
Going out? Wow.

21
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,412
It didn't work out with Kathy? Bummer.

22
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,955
No, things are fine.

23
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:06,627
I'm having a late meal with her
after an early one with Casey.

24
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,170
-What?
-Yeah.

25
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:12,299
The craziest thing is,
I just ate a whole pizza myself.

26
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,967
Wait....

27
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,470
-You're going out with Kathy.
-Yeah.

28
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,138
Why are you upset?

29
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,765
Well, I'm upset...

30
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,058
...for you.

31
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,688
Sex with an endless line of women
must be unfulfilling.

32
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:32,486
What's the big deal?
It's not like we're exclusive.

33
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,154
Look, Joey.

34
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,699
Kathy's not fulfilling
your emotional needs.

35
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,159
But Casey....

36
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,287
Granted, I just saw
the back of her head.

37
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:46,083
But I got this sense
that she's smart and funny...

38
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,543
...and gets you.

39
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,381
You got all that
from the back of her head?

40
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,633
It's time to settle down.

41
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,635
Make a choice. Pick a lane.

42
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,261
Who's Elaine?

43
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,684
<i>Little Tony Tarzan</i>

44
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:10,107
<i>Swinging on a nose hair
Swinging with the greatest of ease</i>

45
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,152
I don't know the next verse.

46
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,155
You could just go:

47
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,615
<i>Greatest of ease</i>

48
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,075
<i>Ba-ma-na-ma-na-ma....</i>

49
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,827
Then go right into it.

50
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,247
I like that.

51
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,166
How do you know about
"ba-ma-na-ma-na-ma"?

52
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,086
You know, I used to play.

53
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,339
That's right. The keyboards?

54
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,218
A little in high school.
I got into it in college.

55
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,722
That's when I really found my sound.

56
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,936
Juice just came out of my nose,
but it was worth it.

57
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,565
Oh, my God.

58
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,443
-I completely forgot about your sound.
-Yeah.

59
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,612
He'd lock himself in the basement.

60
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,700
No one was ever allowed to hear
"the sound."

61
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,244
I want to hear "the sound."

62
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:09,291
No, I mean, I haven't played in so long.

63
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,836
Well, it's really personal stuff.

64
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,297
Play that funky music, white boy.

65
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,259
-Yeah, come on.
-No, you guys.

66
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,387
My keyboards are all the way-
Yeah, okay.

67
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,520
Okay, guys.

68
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,440
All right. Bring it on, you.

69
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,361
Here we go.

70
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:49,289
You know, I've never played
my stuff for anyone before.

71
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,000
It's important that you understand...

72
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,586
...it's about communicating...

73
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,173
...very private emotions.

74
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,014
You know....

75
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:10,185
You should think of my work...

76
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,897
...as wordless sound poems.

77
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,238
-That's what-
-My God, play.

78
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,692
Well, you know, that was...

79
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,486
...terrific.

80
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,573
Really...

81
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,616
...bitchin'.

82
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:12,038
Wow. It was so wow.

83
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,498
Really?

84
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:18,587
Yeah. I mean, you should
play in public.

85
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,090
Wow, thanks, you guys. That's-

86
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,509
I want to play you another piece.

87
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,887
Oh.

88
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,433
I left my helicopter sounds
on another disk. I'll be back.

89
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:37,105
This is so nice. I mean, I am so....

90
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,613
God bless my dad
for soundproofing the basement.

91
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:50,076
I can't believe I ever let him
touch me with those fingers.

92
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,539
What are you guys talking about?
I loved it.

93
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,125
It was so moving.

94
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,837
It's so different
from the stuff you usually hear.

95
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,756
You mean, music?

96
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,471
I know what you think.

97
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:13,391
Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy.

98
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,020
Come in.

99
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,356
Hey.

100
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,733
Oh, God. Is that <i>Baywatch?</i>

101
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:25,278
Yes, but I just watch it
for the articles.

102
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,614
So is Joey around?

103
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,908
No, he's not back yet.

104
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,452
Come in, have a seat. Bow or stern?

105
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,788
I don't have a preference. You?

106
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,956
I like it in the stern.

107
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,252
Of the boat.

108
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,381
Hello.

109
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,343
It's me. Casey and I
had a little car trouble.

110
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,345
-What happened?
-<i>We broke down.</i>

111
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,639
I have to get transmission fluid.

112
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,601
Tell Kathy that I'm sorry
and I'll be there soon.

113
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,356
-Why can't you tell her?
-<i>I think my time is about to-</i>

114
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,149
Joey? Joey?

115
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,359
Yeah?

116
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,613
I thought your time ran out.

117
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,324
Me too, but I guess I do have-

118
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,997
Joey's running a little late,
and he says he's sorry.

119
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,500
I guess it's just you and me, then.

120
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,668
Oh.

121
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,504
-Okay.
-Yeah, I think it is.

122
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,176
So what'd you do today?

123
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,011
I had an appointment
to cut my hair.

124
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,098
-Looks great.
-And then it got canceled.

125
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,976
I could cut it.

126
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,561
Really?

127
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,566
Yeah, I learned at my aunt's
dog-grooming shop. What do you say?

128
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,568
Dog grooming?

129
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,112
Don't make my tail too poofy.

130
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,662
You have really great hair.

131
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,373
Oh, thanks. I grow it myself.

132
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,214
Joey also has great hair.

133
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,425
Yes, Joey has great hair.

134
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:15,096
I'm basically done here.
Let me get this hair off your neck.

135
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,236
What are you doing?

136
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,947
Checking if it's even.

137
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,033
Okay.

138
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,953
Looks good.

139
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,793
The phone! The phone's making sounds.

140
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,004
-Hello.
-Hey, dude, it's me.

141
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,214
Hey, it's Joey.

142
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,134
It looks like we'll be stuck here.

143
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,971
I got the fluid.
The transmission wasn't there.

144
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,390
-What?
-<i>It fell out.</i>

145
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,018
I just figured we hit a dog.

146
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,187
Okay.

147
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,690
<i>Could you put Kathy on?
I want to apologize to her.</i>

148
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,818
It's Joey.

149
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,528
Hey....

150
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,614
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

151
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,742
Yeah, no, stop apologizing. It's okay.

152
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,245
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

153
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,083
-I should probably go.
-Yeah.

154
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,168
Yes. Yeah....

155
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,891
I forgot my purse.

156
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,476
Oh....

157
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,569
I really did. I forgot my purse.

158
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,661
-This is bad. It's bad.
-Horrible.

159
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,873
Wait, the kiss or the situation?

160
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,958
The kiss was good.

161
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,878
-But that's bad.
-Here's what we do.

162
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,046
-We forget it.
-What?

163
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:17,302
We swallow our feelings, even if
we're unhappy forever. Sound good?

164
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,971
Can you really do that?

165
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,558
I have to. He's my best friend.

166
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,351
And you're seeing him.

167
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,563
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.

168
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,273
But with you-

169
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,567
No, don't. Don't, see?

170
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,653
You're getting me confused.
I'm starting to yearn.

171
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,450
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,913
If you want to pretend that
nothing happened, I can try.

173
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,333
I think we have to.

174
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,710
Okay.

175
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,756
-Bye.
-Bye.

176
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,352
Are you still out there?

177
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,729
No.

178
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,990
<i>Electrifying</i>

179
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,622
<i>Infinite time</i>

180
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,125
There's a Starbucks
about three blocks down.

181
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,380
He's so inspired.
Just look at him. Look at him go.

182
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,357
Thank you very much.

183
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,776
Hey, aren't you up next?

184
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,406
-I'm not playing tonight.
-Why not?

185
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,575
I can't follow Ross.

186
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,954
It'd be like those
poor bicycle-riding chimps...

187
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,207
...who had to follow the Beatles. No.

188
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,295
Phoebe. Ross sucks.

189
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,966
The place has emptied because of him.

190
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,095
My God, he's not even
appreciated in his own time.

191
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,474
I'd give anything to not be
appreciated in my own time.

192
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,354
Okay. Phoebe....

193
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,983
You suck too.

194
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,653
Yeah, Phoebe.

195
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,406
You're awful.

196
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,077
You guys.

197
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,997
You suck too.

198
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:01,007
Man. I can't believe
I locked myself out again.

199
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,301
Hang on, buddy.

200
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,557
My God. What happened?

201
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,643
-Did you do all this? Why?
-I sure did.

202
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,522
It made me feel good to do
something nice for my friend.

203
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,107
You're amazing.

204
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,652
No, this is amazing.

205
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,032
A TV appears from nowhere.

206
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:28,910
The dream.

207
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,954
How did you afford all this?

208
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,208
I'm 29. I mean, who needs
a savings account?

209
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,169
You're the best friend
anyone has ever had.

210
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,047
I don't know.

211
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,465
No, you are.

212
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,093
You do this, you give me advice....

213
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:49,180
What you said about
focusing on one woman?

214
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,515
I'll do that.

215
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,933
With Casey?

216
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,520
I'll see how things go with Kathy.
She's cool.

217
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,147
-Or Casey.
-No, Kathy.

218
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,315
Could be Casey.

219
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,608
No, Kathy.

220
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,776
Consider Casey.

221
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,031
I think somebody's
got a little crush on Casey.

222
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,034
I'll fix you two up.
What do you think?

223
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:14,622
That all the pieces of my life
are falling right into place.

224
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,464
-Hey.
-Hey.

225
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,927
You were really great.
You were really, really great.

226
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,387
Thanks.

227
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:35,184
Monica tells me you don't want
to play anymore because of me...

228
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,562
...and, you know, my talent.

229
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:39,856
Is that true?

230
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,734
-Well, kind of, yeah.
-Pheebs....

231
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,780
I was trying to be really okay
and upbeat about it...

232
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,534
...but I just feel so dwarfed
by your musical gift.

233
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,704
See, but....

234
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,709
Pheebs, that is the exact
opposite intent of my music.

235
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,129
You know, my music
is meant to inspire.

236
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,298
If it bothers you this much...

237
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:09,135
...then I won't play anymore.

238
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,055
No, don't do that.

239
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:18,436
How could I live if I knew I was
depriving the world of your music?

240
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,899
Yeah, okay.

241
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,450
Hey, Chandler.
Saw the new furniture. Very nice.

242
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,827
Joey has the best boyfriend ever.

243
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,789
I kissed Kathy.

244
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,374
What? Are you serious?

245
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,460
-Does Joey know?
-No.

246
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,422
Is there any way you think
he will understand this?

247
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,718
You obviously haven't
screwed over your friends.

248
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,845
Which we all appreciate.

249
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:57,683
If you'd told him how you felt
before you kissed her...

250
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,436
...knowing Joey,
he'd have stepped aside.

251
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,649
Don't say that. That's not true, is it?

252
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,442
-Yeah.
-He loves you.

253
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,278
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?

254
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,906
I said something to Phoebe.

255
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,784
And I thought it was a really good idea.

256
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,995
-Yeah, I remember.
-Oh, my God.

257
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,373
What am I going to do?

258
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,291
You'll have to tell him.

259
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,043
Why do I have to?

260
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,004
-Because you do.
-Yeah, I know.

261
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,387
Would it be okay
if I wrote a song about this?

262
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,894
-Hey.
-Hey.

263
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,938
Sambuca Margarita?

264
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,148
It that a real thing?

265
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,569
Well, we only had sambuca, so it is now.

266
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,822
Listen, Joe. I need to-

267
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,574
I need to talk to you.

268
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,867
What's up?

269
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,745
It's about Kathy.

270
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,166
I like her.

271
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,794
I like her a lot, actually.

272
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,754
You do?

273
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:09,964
Yeah.

274
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,758
Your timing couldn't be better.

275
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,802
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

276
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,137
What?

277
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,850
-Yeah, she broke up with me.
-When?

278
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,269
Just now, after acting class.

279
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,273
I thought she was doing some scene,
so I let people watch.

280
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,737
Man, I am so sorry. Are you okay?

281
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:37,241
I've been better, but I'm all right.
So you like her?

282
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,036
Yes, but I don't have to.

283
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,955
No, it's okay.

284
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,833
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

285
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,420
You know why?
Because you came to me first.

286
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,051
I thought that would be
the best thing to do.

287
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,846
You might have your work
cut out for you.

288
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:03,934
When I talked to her, I got the feeling
she's into some other guy.

289
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,981
See, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

290
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,985
I think I know who the other guy is.

291
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,445
Who?

292
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,615
It's me.

293
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,575
I'm the other guy.

294
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,535
What?

295
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:27,375
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking...

296
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,336
...and one thing led to another, and....

297
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,963
And what? Did you sleep with her?

298
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,799
No, I just kissed her.

299
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,093
What? That's even worse.

300
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,763
-How is that worse?
-It's the same.

301
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,351
There's nothing I could do.
I'm in love with her.

302
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,560
Who cares?

303
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,855
You went behind my back?
I'd never do that to you.

304
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,401
I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

305
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:58,447
You're so far past the line,
that you can't even see the line.

306
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,199
It's a dot to you.

307
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,909
Yes.

308
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:06,163
Yes, right. And I feel horrible.
You have to believe me.

309
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,833
Is that why you bought all this?

310
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,836
You know what?

311
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,505
I will not watch your TV.

312
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,590
I won't listen to your stereo.

313
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,095
And there's a loaf in the new bread maker
I won't eat. Know why?

314
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,263
Because-

315
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,015
It's all tainted with your betrayal.

316
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,480
This apartment is empty to me.
I'm not happy about you, either.

317
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,822
And just so you know...

318
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,658
...I made that bread for you.

319
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,050
Oh, my God. He's totally lost it.

320
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,262
What?

321
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,807
Phoebe. This cannot get any worse.

322
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,102
Rats in the basement
are hanging themselves.

323
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,781
Thank you. Thanks.

324
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,827
I lost it.

325
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,456
I won't play anymore.

326
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,709
Would you- Can you finish my set?

327
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,045
After that? Yeah.

328
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,549
No, I mean, if I can help.

329
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,557
Like I could lose it.

330
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,188
-What?
-I played bad on purpose, guys.

331
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,814
-Oh.
-Oh.

332
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,859
You were playing bad this whole time.

333
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,528
Just that last song.
