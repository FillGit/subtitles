1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,422
Hello?

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,634
<i>It's me. I know you can't
stand to be in the same room.</i>

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,553
<i>I just thought I'd try and apologize
over the phone-</i>

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,101
Hello?

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,189
<i>Look, I never should've
kissed your girlfriend, and I'm-</i>

6
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,110
Stop calling!

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>Hey, hey, hey. This is 92.3 WXRK K-Rock...</i>

8
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,284
<i>...calling with our $1000 daily challenge.</i>

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,702
All right.

10
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,079
<i>What is the name of...</i>

11
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:41,875
<i>...your roommate who is very, very sorry
and would do anything-?</i>

12
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,842
Ugh, turkey.

13
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,345
Ugh, giving thanks. Ugh.

14
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,640
Look, everyone,
it's the spirit of Thanksgiving.

15
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,143
Are things with Joey any better?

16
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,104
They couldn't be worse.
I spent eight hours calling him...

17
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,148
...trying to get him to talk to me.

18
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,151
Oh, wow. Eight hours.

19
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,988
So you could probably really use one
of those plug-in telephone headsets, huh?

20
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:57,618
Should we all expect Christmas gifts
that can be stolen from your office?

21
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,371
You shouldn't.

22
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,499
Speaking of Christmas...

23
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,670
...since Monica and I are starting
a new business and have like no money...

24
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,674
...this year maybe we could do Secret Santa
and then we each only buy one gift.

25
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,928
And there's the added mystery of,
you know, who gets who.

26
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,223
Who gets "whom."

27
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,561
I don't know why I do that.

28
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:31,193
Oh, I'm gonna take a nap.
Turkey makes me sleepy.

29
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,236
We haven't eaten yet.

30
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:38,033
I know, but all that work you're doing
to get it ready, and I just....

31
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,871
Hey, did either of you pick Rachel
for your Secret Santa?

32
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,416
-Because I wanna trade for her.
-I picked her. Oh, thank God, you want her.

33
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,959
Ooh.

34
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,295
Wow, why do you wanna get rid of her
so badly?

35
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,422
Because she exchanges
every gift she gets.

36
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,092
It's, like, impossible
to get her something she likes.

37
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,843
Come on, let's trade.

38
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,805
That's not true.
I got her that backpack and she loved it.

39
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:04,351
I remember how much she was crying
the day that big dog ran off with-

40
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,188
There was no big dog.

41
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:13,860
This sucks, because I already got her
this briefcase and I had "R.G." put on it.

42
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,363
-Her initials.
-Oh.

43
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,535
Maybe you can give it to somebody else.
Oh. Like Ross Geller.

44
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,746
Oh, you know what, though?
It's a girlie briefcase.

45
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,041
Who cares? He works in a museum.

46
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,878
Hey, what time is it?
The big game's about to start.

47
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,215
Ross and Joey aren't here.
You can watch the parade if you want.

48
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,967
Thanks.

49
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,805
What is wrong with this freezer? Ow! Ow!

50
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,975
-God, what happened?
-Oh, my God, ice just got in my eye.

51
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,103
People are trying to sleep in here.

52
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,272
Monica got ice in her eye and it hurts.

53
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,358
-Open it up. Let me see.
-Oh, I can't. It really kills.

54
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,819
Well, maybe you should put
some ice on it.

55
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,824
-Ooh, it looks bad.
-Maybe we should take you to a doctor.

56
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,826
No, my eye doctor is Richard.

57
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,121
I can't go to him
when I don't have a boyfriend.

58
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,832
He's really picky about his patients.

59
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,918
Okay, you've gotta go.
What's his office number?

60
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,838
Oh, like I remember his office number.

61
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,506
Speed dial 7.

62
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,971
Hi, yeah, I'm calling on behalf
of Monica Geller's eye, and....

63
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,433
Is Richard Burke in today?

64
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,186
He's out of town.
Does she wanna see the on-call doctor?

65
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,981
-Yes.
-Yes. She's very excited about that.

66
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,194
It's so cool.

67
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,158
Till Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef
and I get to make all the decisions.

68
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,661
Hey, hey, I thought she told you
to follow the recipe exactly.

69
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,872
Okay, get out of my kitchen.

70
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,210
All right, okay. I think I'm making
some progress with Joey.

71
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,046
When I went into the apartment,
he went to his bedroom...

72
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,465
...but he only slammed the door once.

73
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,010
I mean, yeah,
he gave me the finger while doing it.

74
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,682
All right, I gotta call my mom and ask her
a left-handed cooking question.

75
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,314
So listen,
I picked Monica for Secret Santa...

76
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,566
...but I'm getting her something
for Hanukkah.

77
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,943
You wanna switch?

78
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,571
Oh, you know what?
I was trying to trade for, uh, ahem, well, you.

79
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,743
Really? Wow, that's so nice.
What are you gonna get me?

80
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,330
I don't know, R.G. I was thinking
something girlie for your office.

81
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,210
Yeah. Well, maybe Phoebe
will switch with me.

82
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:39,965
Then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel,
and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.

83
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:43,134
Oh, that's not true.
I got her lots of stuff she never took back.

84
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,511
Like?

85
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,680
Like that gold necklace
I got her last year.

86
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,266
When was the last time
you saw her wear it?

87
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,936
Well, she wore it all Christmas day
and then, uh....

88
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,480
Big dog?

89
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,112
-Hey.
-Hey.

90
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,572
What are you doing?

91
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,324
Sending back this stuff Chandler bought
out of guilt.

92
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,662
-Everything? Even the TV?
-No, I'm gonna put that in my room.

93
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:16,459
Listen, Joey.
I know what he did was wrong.

94
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,879
But don't you think
you could hear the guy out?

95
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,755
When you and Rachel were together...

96
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,425
...if Chandler had kissed her,
would you hear him out?

97
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,135
That's a good point.

98
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,555
So how long you gonna punish him?

99
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,307
Five years.

100
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,517
You've sentenced him?

101
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,770
Hey, don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

102
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,983
-But, Joey, the guy's your best friend.
-No, was my best friend.

103
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,360
I don't know why
you're pushing for him so hard.

104
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,072
With him out of the way as my best friend,
there's a spot open.

105
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,952
-Who, me?
-Yeah.

106
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,996
Wow. I'm honored.

107
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,082
You know what I'm gonna do
as my first act as your best friend?

108
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,710
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.

109
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,963
All right.

110
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,341
Oh, but if you weren't my best friend....

111
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,717
Ah.

112
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,554
Oh, my God. Is it really that bad?

113
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,015
I walk in the room,
and he won't even talk to me.

114
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,352
He just mumbles something in Italian.

115
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,105
And I know he only knows
the bad words.

116
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,695
Hey, Gunther, have you seen Chandler?

117
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,864
I thought you were Chandler.

118
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,869
But, um, one of you is over there.

119
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:39,960
Oh.

120
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,462
Hey, Joe.

121
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,306
I'll be right with you, okay?

122
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,600
Thanks for coming in.

123
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,980
Oh, my God.
How cute is the on-call doctor?

124
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,775
Oh. So cute that I'm thinking
about jamming this pen in my eye.

125
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,571
Dr. Burke will see you now.

126
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,241
Oh, no, no, no, not Dr. Burke.
Dr. Burke's out of town.

127
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,159
The on-call doctor will see me now.

128
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,911
Dr. Richard Burke is out.

129
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,498
Dr. Timothy Burke, his son,
will see you now.

130
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,543
Ready?

131
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,927
Hey, I'm sorry. That-

132
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,556
-Where you going?
-My folks'.

133
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,391
Oh. Uh....

134
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,143
When you coming back?

135
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,561
I don't know.

136
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,856
I might stay there for a few days
while I look for an apartment.

137
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,816
What?

138
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,862
Yeah, you know, at first I thought
we could talk about this, work it out.

139
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,281
But seeing you two together, I don't....

140
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,452
Hey, look, what do you want me to say?
Do you want me to say I'll stop seeing her?

141
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,288
It's not about her. Okay?

142
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,958
But seeing you two together
just reminds me of what you did.

143
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,795
And I don't wanna live with someone
who doesn't know what it is to be a friend.

144
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,340
-So I'll see you.
-Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend.

145
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,635
-I just- I screwed up.
-Yeah, you did.

146
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,388
And that's why I'm leaving.

147
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,059
Look, if you're not gonna stay for me,
then at least stay for them.

148
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,357
Okay? They have had a very difficult year,
what with the robbery and all.

149
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,526
When that guy was robbing us...

150
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,571
...and I was locked in the entertainment unit
for six hours...

151
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,448
...do you know what I was doing?

152
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,492
I was thinking about how I let you down.

153
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:37,827
-Wow.
-Yeah.

154
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,748
If I'd have known what kind of friend you
were gonna be, I wouldn't have worried.

155
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,875
-See you around.
-All right, wait, come on.

156
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,921
Just wait one second.
There has to be something that I can do.

157
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,422
If we still had that unit...

158
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,343
...I would get in there for six hours
and think about how I let you down.

159
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,683
What?

160
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,018
We got a box.

161
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,775
I remember the last time I saw you.

162
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,486
It was the morning I left for college.

163
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,864
You were just standing
outside the Dairy Queen.

164
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,201
Heh. Just probably waiting for it to open.

165
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,037
Gotta tell you, you look great now.

166
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,624
-You look great too.
-You're an excellent patient.

167
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,460
So how does it look?

168
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,756
You've got a little scratch on your cornea.
You're gonna have to wear a patch.

169
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,716
Like a pirate?

170
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,635
If that helps you.

171
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,476
Ahem. So how long have you been working
with your dad?

172
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,980
Come on, one of us had to mention him.

173
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,732
I moved back here a couple months ago.

174
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,067
Ah.

175
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,820
-Big family dinner tonight?
-Uh....

176
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,447
No way.

177
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,741
I was gonna have Thanksgiving
at my girlfriend's.

178
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,326
-Oh.
-But we broke up.

179
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,786
Oh?

180
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,582
She wasn't ready
for a serious commitment.

181
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,417
Oh.

182
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,796
So you made her walk
the plank, aye, matey?

183
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,465
You're not wearing the patch yet.

184
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,554
I know.

185
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,479
-He's coming here for Thanksgiving?
-I know. It's sick.

186
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,566
-Why is it sick?
-Because it's Richard's son.

187
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,319
It's like inviting a Greek tragedy
over for dinner.

188
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,573
I mean, come on,
Phoebe, you understand, don't you?

189
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,951
Yeah, I could see where I'd be
your best shot, but no.

190
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,705
-Sorry, honey. I think it's twisted.
-Yeah.

191
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,750
-What's twisted?
-Oh. Me going out with Richard's son.

192
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,460
Ew.

193
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,630
Ew, ew, ew.

194
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,758
It sounds like a really bad idea to me.

195
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,762
Is he okay in there?

196
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,348
He's fine.

197
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,809
You know, if things work out
between you and Richard's son...

198
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:11,272
...you'll be able to tell your kids
that you slept with their grandfather.

199
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,609
Fine, judge all you want to.

200
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,905
But married a lesbian, left a man at the altar,
fell in love with a gay ice dancer...

201
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,116
...threw a girl's wooden leg in the fire,
live in a box.

202
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,251
So, now, ahem,
what exactly is the point of the box?

203
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,170
Chandler?

204
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,632
The meaning of the box is threefold.

205
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:42,262
One, it gives me the time
to think about what I did.

206
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:47,809
Two, it proves how much I care
about my friendship with Joey.

207
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,519
And three...

208
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,438
...it hurts.

209
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,900
-Oh, hey, hey, uh....
-Hmm?

210
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,278
Remember that necklace
I gave you last year?

211
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,696
Can I see it?

212
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,282
Why?

213
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,659
I just wanna check something.

214
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,536
Okay.

215
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,374
Now we'll see.

216
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,252
Air hole! Air hole!

217
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,090
Here it is. I love it. I wear it all the time.

218
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,680
The necklace I got you was gold.
This is silver.

219
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,724
Huh.

220
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,893
Well, maybe, it, uh...

221
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,729
...it changed.

222
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,357
Oh, my God. You actually exchanged it.

223
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,444
Isn't it better that I exchange it
for something that I enjoy...

224
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,362
...and I can get a lot of use out of?

225
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,239
What did you get?

226
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,158
Credit.

227
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:52,248
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.

228
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:55,793
-Hi, Tim.
-Hi.

229
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,339
Hi. Thank you. Come meet my friends.

230
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,633
-This is Phoebe.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

231
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,843
-And Joey.
-Hey.

232
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,595
-Joey.
-My brother, Ross.

233
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,929
-Hey.
-And Rachel.

234
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,765
-Hi.
-Ahem.

235
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,270
-That's Chandler.
-How do you do?

236
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,191
-What's--?
-Um, well, he's, urn....

237
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,693
He's doing some thinking.

238
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,530
<i>He's got it.</i>

239
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,948
-Yes!
-Yeah!

240
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,535
-What happened?
-You kissed my girlfriend.

241
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,083
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.

242
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,667
"Like them" like them...

243
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,129
...or "I'd like to get store credit
for that amount" like them?

244
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,597
All right, everybody. This turkey is ready.

245
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,350
-Where can I wash up?
-Here.

246
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,102
Let me show you.

247
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:58,314
The towels are hanging next to the sink.
And you can use the fancy soap. Ha, ha.

248
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,191
Thank you.

249
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:04,112
Fancy soap?
I thought we were saving that for the Pope.

250
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,156
See? He's nice, right?

251
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,035
Do you really wanna be in a relationship
where you can actually use the phrase...

252
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,329
..."That's not how your dad
used to do it"?

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,711
Wow, everything looks great.
Where should I sit?

254
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,963
Saved you a seat.

255
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,299
Sick, sick, sick.

256
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,719
Oh, I'll get it.

257
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,929
Gotcha.

258
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,935
That doesn't sound like thinking to me.

259
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,480
-Sorry.
-I don't think you should be talking at all.

260
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,942
I think you got too much thinking to do
to be talking and making jokes.

261
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,819
Okay, okay, you got it.

262
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,405
-Ross, could you pass me the yams?
-Sure.

263
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:50,825
Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes
if you want to exchange them.

264
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,707
Will you stop?
What is the matter with you?

265
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,500
Heh, hen. We've got company.

266
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,838
There's nothing the matter with me.

267
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,215
See, I'm not completely devoid
of sentiment.

268
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,009
See, I have feelings.

269
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,137
Okay, fine.

270
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:21,105
-ou can't tell, but I'm trying
to break the tension by mooning you guys.

271
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,404
All right, look.

272
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,657
If this is just a big joke to you,
then forget about it, all right?

273
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,659
This means something to me.

274
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,537
If it doesn't mean anything to you,
then get out of there.

275
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,373
Otherwise, you're just an idiot in a box.

276
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,585
You're right. I'm sorry.
This means a lot to me.

277
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:47,924
I want you to be my friend again.
I swear I won't say another word tonight.

278
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,260
-So you're gonna take this thing seriously?
-Absolutely.

279
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,971
That sounds like another word to me.

280
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,391
Are you gonna take this seriously?

281
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,605
Okay.

282
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,360
Don't say that I have no sentiment.

283
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,447
This is a movie stub from our first date.

284
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:15,451
This is an eggshell from the first time
you made me breakfast in bed.

285
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:20,248
This is from the museum,
the first time we...

286
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,874
...were together.

287
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:28,089
Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter.

288
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,425
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

289
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,095
Though...

290
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,347
...you're not supposed to take these.

291
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,645
It's like a million years old.

292
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,274
We actually-
We have people looking for that.

293
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,030
Oh, this always happens.

294
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,074
Here, let me, urn....

295
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,034
Thank you.

296
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,249
You have very beautiful...

297
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,042
...eye.

298
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,671
My friends all think this is weird.

299
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:13,467
I thought it was gonna be weird.
I almost called to cancel, but it really isn't.

300
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,430
I know. I mean, it's like me and your dad,
that's a totally separate thing.

301
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,931
Oh, I totally agree.

302
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,977
I mean, we're just two people
who find each other...

303
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,229
...very attractive.

304
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,981
Right?

305
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,037
-What?
-Nothing, nothing.

306
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,456
No, no, really. Oh, was that not okay?

307
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,999
No, no, no, that was good.

308
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,586
That was, uh- That was a good kiss.

309
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,548
-Oh, my God. It didn't remind you of my-?
-Oh, don't say it.

310
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,634
-But it did, didn't it?
-Yes!

311
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,469
Oh, man.

312
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,471
I know.

313
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,815
I got it.

314
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,738
Oh.

315
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,616
-Hey.
-Hey.

316
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:22,328
-I want you to know how sorry I am-
-It's okay.

317
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,372
Chandler's the one I'm mad at, so....

318
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,416
Well, I'm still sorry.

319
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,003
-Is he here?
-In the box.

320
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:39,929
Chandler?

321
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,723
Oh, he can't talk right now.

322
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,017
Why not? What's going on?

323
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,229
He's trying to show Joey
how much he means to him.

324
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,483
-By being in a box?
-Joey had reasons.

325
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,403
They were threefold.

326
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,865
Oh. Well, uh...

327
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,953
...you not being able to talk
might actually make this easier.

328
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,289
Listen, urn....

329
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,174
Listen.

330
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:23,639
I don't wanna be someone
who comes between two best friends.

331
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,643
I just- I can't stand seeing
what this is doing to you guys.

332
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,604
And I don't wanna be the cause of that.

333
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,150
So I don't think
we can see each other anymore.

334
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,737
I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago.

335
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,573
I'm gonna stay there for a while.

336
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,457
I think this could have been something
really amazing.

337
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:54,170
But, you know,
this is probably for the best.

338
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,172
You know?

339
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,803
I'm gonna miss you.

340
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,933
Goodbye, Chandler.

341
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,029
Open the box.

342
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,031
-What?
-He can still catch her.

343
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,826
Hey, come on. Get out of there.
Get out of there.

344
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,122
-So--?
-Yeah, we're gonna be fine. Get out.

345
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,709
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

346
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,170
You did some real good thinking in there.

347
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,088
I mean, this is....

348
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,970
Now go. You could still catch her.

349
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,890
And merry Christmas
from your Secret Santa.

350
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,396
All right, who got Chandler?
Because I need to trade.

351
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,196
Oh, he sees her.

352
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:05,241
Aw, and he's catching up to her.

353
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,910
Oh, she sees him.

354
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,496
-Oh, they're hugging.
-Aw.

355
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,375
He's taking her purse.

356
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,380
Uh, that's not them.
I'm gonna go call the police.

357
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,259
-Oh, there they are.
-Where?

358
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,802
-Ah!
-Oh.

359
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,262
Aw.

360
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,601
All right, get a room.
