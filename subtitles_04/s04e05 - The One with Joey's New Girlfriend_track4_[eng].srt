1
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,052
Hello!

2
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,845
What's this?

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,098
Oh, right!
It's that girl's phone number.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,938
There it is.
Just a phone number...

5
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,024
...a really hot girl gave me.

6
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,863
No big deal. I mean,
it is her home phone number but....

7
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,702
Whoa!

8
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,750
Whoops! Heh. Almost lost this baby!

9
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,964
The lovely Amanda gives me her number,
and I go and drop it.

10
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,224
Thank you.

11
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,191
-Rachel?
-Yeah?

12
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,944
-When's your birthday?
-May 5th. Why?

13
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,530
I'm making a list of birthdays.

14
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,366
-Mine's December-
-Yeah, whatever.

15
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,039
Oh! She's pretty!

16
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,959
Pretty, uh, pretty girl. The pretty-
She's pretty.

17
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,546
-Go ask her out.
-Ha, ha.

18
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,883
-What's the worst that could happen?
-I could die.

19
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,886
Yeah, it's tough being single.

20
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,306
That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.

21
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,893
Ross, you guys went out once.

22
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:27,439
You took your kids to Chuck E. Cheese,
and you didn't even kiss her.

23
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,403
I tell people secrets.

24
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,197
It makes them like me.

25
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,077
Hey.

26
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,621
Phoebe.

27
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,791
You're sick.
You shouldn't play. Go home.

28
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,793
But I'm unemployed.

29
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,629
My music is all I really have now.

30
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,758
Well, music and making my own shoes.
Pretty, huh?

31
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,473
All right, I'll do it.

32
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,517
I'll go get shot down.

33
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,435
Any advice?

34
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,978
Just be yourself...

35
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,147
...but not too much.

36
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,442
Wish me luck.

37
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,236
Good luck!

38
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,157
Wish it!

39
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:24,830
Hi. I was just sitting over there and....

40
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,290
Uh, my name's Chandler.
Did I say that?

41
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,668
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.

42
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,129
-Kathy with a K or a C?
-With a K.

43
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,672
Hey!

44
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,801
Wow, you are really good at this!

45
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,970
I'm out on a limb here!

46
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,139
I'm sorry. You're right.

47
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,808
But I should tell you
I'm waiting for a date.

48
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,519
And there he is now!

49
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,354
-Hey!
-Hey!

50
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,148
-Hey! Hey!
-Hey!

51
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,817
-I see you guys already met.
-Yeah.

52
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,194
I was trying to demonstrate...

53
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,864
...how I could get my
very large feet...

54
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,324
...into my even bigger mouth.

55
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,994
Didn't I tell you?

56
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,496
Always showing off.

57
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,293
Before I start, I want to say
that I have a cold.

58
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:15,672
So if I sneeze during a song,
it's not on purpose.

59
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,009
Oh! Except the last verse of
"Pepper People."

60
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,433
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

61
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,603
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

62
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,023
This chick sounds good.

63
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,108
<i>Smelly cat</i>

64
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,071
Gunther, be a good little boy
and bring me a whiskey.

65
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,955
-Hi.
-Hi.

66
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,418
At 2:30 a.m., I didn't expect
to fight over the remote.

67
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:57,339
Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacs
thing I wanted to watch.

68
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,216
That's why I got up too.

69
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,218
You're kidding? I love him!

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,432
Sorry about this afternoon.
If I'd known, I wouldn't have....

71
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,059
Oh, please. Heh.

72
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,396
Joey tells me you two met
in acting class.

73
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,567
We were partners.
Joey picked three scenes for us.

74
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,570
-All of them had us making out.
-Ha-ha-ha.

75
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,074
That's good, because he used to
make me rehearse with him.

76
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,245
-Oh, oh, oh!
-Is it on?

77
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,622
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!

78
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,873
Hey!

79
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,961
Oh, my God!

80
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,630
Oh! It's on!

81
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,098
Here we go, little fella.

82
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,600
What about the duck?

83
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,644
-The duck can swim.
-Of course.

84
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,483
<i>My sticky shoes</i>

85
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,945
<i>My sticky, sticky shoes</i>

86
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,198
<i>Why you stick on me?</i>

87
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,325
<i>Baby</i>

88
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,705
Thanks for the lights, honey.

89
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,459
Way to go!

90
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,628
Your cold makes you sound great.

91
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,798
It's fun.
God, I love how sexy I am!

92
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,639
Kath, we should get going.
We're going to buy hamsters.

93
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,474
-Aw.
-I love them.

94
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:36,021
No, it's not like that.
I work for a medical researcher.

95
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,150
-Have fun.
-Okay.

96
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,986
It's nice that
the medical community...

97
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,196
...is trying to help sick hamsters.

98
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,035
-You know, I like Kathy.
-Yeah?

99
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,246
Me too!
She's so cool and pretty.

100
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,497
She is.

101
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,000
She's smart and funny.

102
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,504
We were up all last night talking.
She said the funniest thing about-

103
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,964
What?

104
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,176
You love her.

105
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,219
No, I don't.

106
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,847
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.

107
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,353
-Come on, just lay off him.
-Thank you.

108
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,231
He's a little sensitive right now
because he's so in love!

109
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,025
All right.

110
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,695
Ooh, Kathy!

111
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,364
Kathy, I love you!

112
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:42,003
I need to write some depressing stuff
for my new bluesy voice.

113
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,714
But nothing sad has
ever happened to me.

114
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,008
How about your mom dying?

115
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,928
Or living on the streets
when you were 14?

116
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:51,930
Uh-huh.

117
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:56,559
I could write about when
my hair did that woo-hoo thing.

118
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,564
-Hey.
-Hey.

119
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,234
I'm going over to Amanda's tonight.

120
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,111
-Rachel's not here.
-Oh.

121
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,740
How's it going with her?

122
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,786
Great, actually. I'm thinking
tonight may be the night.

123
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,915
The kids will play together,
and when they're asleep...

124
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,043
...Amanda and I break
open a bottle of wine...

125
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,255
...do a little playing ourselves.

126
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,343
Hi, guys! This is Josh.

127
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,137
Josh, these are my friends.

128
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,097
And that's Ross.

129
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,933
-Hi, Josh.
-Hi.

130
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,435
Dudes.

131
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,270
You played in college?

132
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:44,149
Aw, I still do.
Next year, I hope to make varsity.

133
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,361
Didn't you play soccer
in high school?

134
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,074
No, wait. You organized their
game schedules on your Commodore 64.

135
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:58,288
It's getting late. I got to get
to the game, so I'll...head.

136
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,128
I'll miss you.

137
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,629
Dope!

138
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,802
Wow! Cute one.

139
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,305
-Very cute.
-I know. Isn't he great?

140
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:19,976
So nice to finally be in a
fun relationship, you know?

141
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,395
There's nothing boring about him.

142
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,856
I bet he's never set foot
in a museum.

143
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,858
Maybe he'll get to go soon.

144
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,652
Like on a class trip or something.

145
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,907
You know what else is
great about him?

146
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,117
Ugh, what's the word for an adult...

147
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,912
...who has no dinosaur toys
in their bedroom?

148
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,622
Oh....

149
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,669
What was that?

150
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,004
Monica knows.

151
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,841
It's this dumb thing Ross made up
to fool our parents.

152
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,637
It's a way of giving the finger
without actually giving it.

153
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,141
I cried the night you made that up.

154
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,187
It was the first time I realized
I was cooler than my big brother.

155
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,733
I'm going to go get ready...

156
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,032
...for my date tonight...

157
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,034
...so I'll just head.

158
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,790
I should go too.
I'm playing in one hour.

159
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,041
Hey....

160
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,962
You guys should come hear me. Ooh!

161
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,421
Hear me. Ooh!

162
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,590
<i>My sticky shoes</i>

00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,509
Ew! Ew!

164
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,264
I lost my sexy phlegm!

165
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,938
-Hi.
-Hi. Hi, Ben.

166
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,566
-You look great!
-Thanks.

167
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,067
Yeah, okay....

168
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,902
Hey, Tommy!

169
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,405
I'm so glad you could come tonight.

170
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,783
Oh, no. It's my pleasure.

171
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,703
My cell phone number
is on the counter.

172
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,080
Help yourself to the fridge.

173
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,458
I appreciate this.
I've been trying to date...

174
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,252
...this guy for a month.

175
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,087
I....

176
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,798
Uh, I'd appreciate it
if you'd drink your wine...

177
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,301
...after the kids are asleep.

178
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,973
Oh, uh....

179
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,768
Thanks for this. I hope I can do
the same for you sometime.

180
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,737
Who wants to make
some long-distance calls?

181
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,789
Kathy! Kathy!

182
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,084
Hi, Kathy! Kathy!

183
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,637
Kathy!

184
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,851
Fetch! Fetch it!

185
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,315
Kathy! Kathy!

186
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,907
Kathy!

187
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,162
Kathy!

188
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,415
Hey. Chandler, what are you doing here?

189
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,919
I just wanted to say, "hey!"

190
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,006
-Hey!
-Okay.

191
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,224
You're making it sound
worse than it was.

192
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,685
Her date tipped me $10!

193
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,732
What are you doing?

194
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,444
I want to be sexy again,
so I'm trying to catch a cold.

195
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,613
Should be easy.
They're pretty common.

196
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,241
You'll catch pneumonia!

197
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,747
You were right.
I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.

198
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,416
-What?
-Are you serious?

199
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,918
How's that possible?
You barely know her.

200
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,878
I don't know. I just-

201
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,381
I can't get her out of my head.

202
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,801
I'm a very bad person.
I'm a very, very bad person.

203
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,970
I'm a horrible person.

204
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,433
"No, you're not.
We still love you, Chandler!"

205
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,981
Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.

206
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,442
You mean you stole it!

207
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,405
Don't cover your mouth
when you do that!

208
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,825
Hey.

209
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,494
We were just talking about you.

210
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,872
Really?

211
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,499
The time you got drunk
and fell asleep...

212
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,959
...with your head in the toilet.

213
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,463
Right in there!

214
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,844
Ninety-nine...

215
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,514
...a hundred.
Ready or not, here I come!

216
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,978
Let's go over the concept
one more time.

217
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,980
-Hey!
-Hey!

218
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,942
You want to get some dinner
with me and Kathy tonight?

219
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,529
Oh, urn.... You know what? I already ate.

220
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,743
-It's 4:30.
-I had a big meal on Monday.

221
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,496
So that'll get me
straight through the week.

222
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,957
I see what's going on here.

223
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,377
-You do?
-Yeah.

224
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,129
You don't like Kathy.

225
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,924
You got me.

226
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,385
You've been avoiding her
since we started dating.

227
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,763
I made an effort to like Janice.

228
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:53,476
Now you make an effort to like Kathy
by going out with us. Right?

229
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,646
-Yeah, right.
-Good. And hey, my treat.

230
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,816
Because you're not eating, right?

231
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,359
Right.

232
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,573
Ross isn't here.

233
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,451
Oh. Stop it!

234
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,581
I'll see you at the party?

235
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,210
Beer's fear, man! 24/7!

236
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,420
Yeah!

237
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,592
I am so going to marry that guy.

238
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,888
-Ugh!
-What?

239
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,057
I think he's stealing from me.

240
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,308
Why?

241
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,186
Because he's stealing from me!

242
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,689
-Hi, it's me.
-Hi.

243
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,023
And soup.

244
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,735
I saw Josh. He looked yummy
in your leather jacket.

245
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,535
I don't eat chicken,
so it's just noodle soup.

246
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,790
There's no chicken in the broth,
so it's really noodle water.

247
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,961
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

248
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,381
What are you doing?

249
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,469
I need your germs.
I want my cold back.

250
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,096
I miss my sexy voice.

251
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,307
Sorry, Phoebe.

252
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,184
It's okay.

253
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,228
-How's the soup?
-Mm.

254
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,997
Oh! Check it out!
You can see that girl's underwear.

255
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,249
-Is she great, or what?
-Ha, ha.

256
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,168
Huh? What do you think?

257
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,588
She's not really my type.

258
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,508
Not your type? She's gorgeous.

259
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,220
You know what it is?
The fishnet stockings.

260
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,681
Whenever I see a girl in those,
it reminds me of...

261
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,934
...my father in fishnet stockings.

262
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,064
Understanding a little more of
why you're single.

263
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,943
I have a friend you'd like.
We could double date.

264
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,278
No, thanks.

265
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:13,574
I've got some ugly friends
who are available too.

266
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,369
I'm going to grab a beer.

267
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,121
I'll be right back.

268
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,588
-What was that?
-What?

269
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,175
Kathy's being really nice
and you walked away.

270
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,219
What do you want from me?

271
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,096
I want you to like her.

272
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:39,225
If that's too damn difficult,
then at least you could pretend.

273
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,810
I am pretending.

274
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,395
Then do it better.

275
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,440
What do you say, I go tell her
how much I like her?

276
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,360
I could tell her
I've been thinking of her.

277
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,946
I haven't stopped thinking
of her since we met.

278
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,157
I'm so over-the-top,
want-to-slit-my-own-throat...

279
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,369
...in love with her,
that every minute...

280
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,498
...I can't believe my own damn bad luck
that you met her first!

281
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,375
That's pretty good.

282
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,423
But you might want
to tone it down a little.

283
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,849
Hey. Uh, Amanda just dropped me off.

284
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,685
That's one of the things
I love about her.

285
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,937
She's old enough to drive.

286
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,026
You're not going
to Mom and Dad's tonight?

287
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,527
No. Sorry.

288
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,362
Where's Amanda?

289
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,114
Get me some cough drops.

290
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,575
I'm thinking you could bring her...

291
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,120
...and go to your old room
and not make out.

292
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,789
Cough drop, please?

293
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,334
At least she's not
going out with me...

294
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,586
...to get into R-rated movies.

295
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,340
Why don't you marry her?

296
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,260
Wait, you can't! I forgot.
She's not a lesbian.

297
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,264
Amanda and I—

298
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,141
You have nothing!

299
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,103
You're not even going out!
You're her babysitter.

300
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,440
You have a 12-year-old girl's job!

301
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,824
Oh, that is so sad.

302
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,330
What are you laughing at,
Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend...

303
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,123
...-is-stealing-from me?

304
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,337
So he stole a few bucks.
Big deal!

305
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,422
He got me something with it.

306
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,299
That's mine!

307
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,972
Would you both please
start acting like adults?

308
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,684
And give me my cough drops!

309
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,396
-Fine.
-Sorry.

310
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,940
-Here.
-Thank you.

311
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,362
At least I made $10 in my relationship.

312
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,699
You know....

313
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,208
<i>Parading goats are parading</i>

314
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,502
<i>Parading down the street</i>

315
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,964
<i>Parading goats are parading</i>

316
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,134
<i>Leaving little treats</i>

317
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,804
Does it even work
without my sexy voice?

318
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,472
I like it.

319
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,643
-Gunther, kiss me.
-What?

320
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,819
<i>Do it, Deputy! Do something!</i>

321
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:46,996
Hey!

322
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,085
We aren't exactly sleeping in here,
but do you mind?

323
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,512
Can I sleep on your couch?

324
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,651
<i>And I'm still waiting</i>

325
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,321
<i>For my papier-mache man</i>

326
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,201
Thank you, my babies.

327
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,540
-Rachel?
-Yeah?

328
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,128
Did you hear what happened
between me and Phoebe?

329
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,547
-No.
-We kissed.

330
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,551
I didn't initiate it,
but I also didn't stop it.

331
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,470
I've been feeling guilty.

332
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:48,891
Okay

333
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,851
So, um...

334
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,728
...are we cool?

335
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,900
Okay.

336
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,070
I knew you would understand.
