1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,465
Hey, new wallet?

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,799
It was time.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:12,304
The old condom ring in the leather
just doesn't say "cool" anymore.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:16,141
Rachel, you just put an empty carton
back in the fridge.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,102
I know,
but the garbage was full.

6
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,314
Have you ever taken out the trash?

7
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,693
Well, I thought you liked doing it.

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,325
-Third door on the left.
-Right!

9
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,711
Hey, Mr. Treeger.

10
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,107
What are you doing?

11
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,652
Urn.... Oh! Oh!

12
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,488
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,490
It's a little old but....

14
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,287
You're clogging up the chute
I just unclogged.

15
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,582
I'm sorry.
I don't come in here a lot.

16
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,502
Aw, of course not.
You're a little princess.

17
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,422
Daddy, buy me a pizza.

18
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,340
Daddy, buy me a candy factory.

19
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,511
Daddy, make the cast of <i>Cats
</i>sing "Happy Birthday" to me.

20
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,431
You think you can come here...

21
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:41,518
...make a mess and a big man
in coveralls will clean it up?

22
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,813
Think of someone else for a change.

23
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,652
Okay, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,203
God, if you're going to cry about it!

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,716
-Whoa, whoa! Treeger made you cry?
-Yes.

26
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:59,721
He said really mean things
that were only partly true.

27
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,724
I'll teach him a lesson.

28
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,477
Joey, don't.
Let's forget about it.

29
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,606
That's easy for you to say.
You weren't almost just killed!

30
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,110
All right, that's it.
School is in session!

31
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,446
My God.

32
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,864
Is this a gym card?

33
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,283
Oh, yeah, gym member.

34
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,079
I try to go four times a week,
but I've missed...

35
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,747
...the last 1200 times.

36
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,292
So why don't you quit?

37
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,003
You don't think I've tried?

38
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:38,301
You think I like having $50 a month
taken from my account?

39
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,722
They make you go
all the way down there.

40
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,393
They use all these phrases
and peppiness to confuse you.

41
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,728
And then they bring out Maria.

42
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,441
-Who is Maria?
-Oh, Maria!

43
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,610
You can't say no to her.

44
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,614
She's like this lycra,
spandex-covered, gym treat.

45
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,411
Do you need me to go with you
and hold your hand?

46
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,581
-No.
-You're strong enough to face her?

47
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,791
Oh, no. You'll have to come.

48
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,339
Tribbiani.

49
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,842
Hold on. I'll get the plunger.

50
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:25,015
Hey. You hold on.
You made my friend Rachel cry.

51
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,350
So you'll go and apologize to her...

52
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,561
...unless you want me
to call the landlord.

53
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,979
And tell him what?

54
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,690
Maybe you haven't heard of
"not making girls cry."

55
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:38,445
Maybe you haven't heard of the
Rent Stabilization Act of 1968.

56
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,448
I have actually not heard of that.

57
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,827
Your friends are violating it.

58
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,581
I've been nice until now,
but I don't need this grief.

59
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,374
I'm telling the landlord...

60
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,836
...Monica's illegally
subletting her grandmother's place.

61
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,339
Your friends are out of here, pal.

62
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,718
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know?

63
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,141
Somebody tell me
I don't have to work today.

64
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,601
What's the matter?

65
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,979
My first massage is
this incredibly gorgeous guy.

66
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,898
Every time I see him,
I want to...

67
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,526
...do things to him
I can't charge for.

68
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,697
So do them for free.

69
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,909
No, it is forbidden.

70
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,623
No, no. Mrs. Potter fires people
for messing around with clients.

71
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,334
And it's against my oath
as a masseuse.

72
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,211
They make you take one?

73
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,213
No, I made myself take one.

74
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,674
No fooling around with clients...

75
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,260
...and, urn, always be prepared.

76
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,100
That one's from the Boy Scouts,
but it just makes good sense.

77
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,770
Why not give him to someone else?

78
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,731
No, I can handle it.
I'm a professional.

79
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,443
Pheebs, is that
a new ankle bracelet?

80
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,362
You got a pedicure.

81
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,072
Your feet are all dressed up.

82
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,661
That's the only part he can see
when he's on the table!

83
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,873
You're going to do
some feet flirting!

84
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,335
I don't know what
you're talking about. Heh.

85
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,797
How do you explain the toe ring?

86
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,137
It's Arabian Princess Day at work.
Leave me alone!

87
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,394
My hero! What happened?

88
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,648
Well, I told him no one treats
my friends like that.

89
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,859
And he better apologize.
See you!

90
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,652
Wait a minute.

91
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,530
-What did he say?
-Uh....

92
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:49,367
He wouldn't apologize, because
you're living here illegally.

93
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,370
Instead, he'll evict you.
See you later!

94
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,832
-You got us evicted?
-I told you not to go down there.

95
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,334
He made Rachel cry!

96
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,252
Rachel always cries!

97
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,547
That's not true!

98
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,218
You go down there,
and you suck up to him.

99
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,263
You suck like
you've never sucked before!

100
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,642
All right, I'll try.

101
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,853
If I can't, you stay with us
till you get settled.

102
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,230
-Go!
-All right, all right.

103
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,067
I'll have to check first,
but he'll be cool.

104
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:31,409
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Remember what
we talked about. You got to be strong.

105
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,370
Yes, yes!

106
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,080
Now one more time.

107
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,540
Don't you want a washboard stomach...

108
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,875
...and rock-hard pecs?

109
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,712
No, I want a flabby gut
and saggy man-breasts.

110
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,882
-Good. That's good.
-Okay.

111
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,098
I want to quit the gym.

112
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,225
You want to quit?

113
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,689
I want to quit the gym.

114
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:05,485
You do realize you won't have
access to our new Swedish spa?

115
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,493
I want to quit the gym.

116
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,747
Dave in the Membership Office
handles quitters.

117
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,419
Excuse me. Are you a member?

118
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,212
Me?

119
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,507
-No.
-Sorry. Members only.

120
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,220
I want to quit the gym!

121
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,015
It's okay, man. Be strong.

122
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,857
So are you a member of any gym?

123
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,777
No, and I'm not going to be.
So save your little speech.

124
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,529
Okay, no problem.

125
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,114
Could you come here?

126
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,618
Hi, I'm Maria.

127
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,495
Hi, M-

128
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,969
Wow. You have really pretty feet.

129
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,181
These old things? Ha.

130
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,686
Would you spend time on my
sciatic area? It's killing me.

131
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,981
You mean....

132
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,650
By sciatic, you mean...

133
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,944
...the towel-covered portion?

134
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,196
Yeah.

135
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,698
Sure, I can do that.

136
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,577
Because, um, the muscles
in the sciatic area can get...

137
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,205
...real nice and tight.

138
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:48,963
Yeah. So, um, tell me, Rick,
how did you injure the area?

139
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,841
A 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.

140
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,426
Oh.

141
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,102
Ow!

142
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,772
-Did you just bite me?
-No!

143
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,240
What?

144
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,868
Please don't kick the girls out.
This was my fault.

145
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,746
You want me to kick
you guys out instead?

146
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,416
You can't. Where would
the chick and the duck live?

147
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,254
-You have pets?
-No. No, no, no.

148
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,047
Those are, uh, nicknames.

149
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,758
I'm the chick,
and Chandler's the duck.

150
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:38,263
Huh. I would've thought
it was the other way around.

151
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,641
Come on. Let the girls stay.

152
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,560
I'll do whatever you want.

153
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,645
Really? You'd do anything?

154
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,147
Yeah, absolutely.

155
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,400
-I got something.
-What is it?

156
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,446
Can you be my dancing partner?

157
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,285
That's not prison lingo, is it?

158
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,753
-His dancing partner?
-Yeah.

159
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,382
There's this superintendents' dance,
"The Super Ball."

160
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,513
He wants to impress Marge,
this lady super he likes.

161
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,724
Why not practice with a girl?

162
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,017
He's too shy.

163
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,228
He's not good enough
to dance with girls yet.

164
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,396
Yeah, right.

165
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,942
He almost danced me right down
that garbage chute.

166
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,946
Would you let it go already?
You're fine.

167
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,202
-Hey.
-So did you quit?

168
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,038
No. I almost did.

169
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,666
Couldn't leave Ross there
without a spotter.

170
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,210
Wait, now, so you joined the gym?

171
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,133
And that's funny, why?

172
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,302
Oh, ahem....

173
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:03,806
I was just, you know,
picturing you working out, and....

174
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,142
Well, that's it.

175
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,145
We're doomed.

176
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:13,775
They'll take $50 a month from our
accounts for the rest of our lives.

177
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:14,984
What'll we do?

178
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,071
You could actually go to the gym.

179
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,494
Or....

180
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,829
Or we could go to the bank...

181
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,917
...close our accounts
and cut them off at the source.

182
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,962
You're a genius.

183
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,507
Oh, man! But then
we won't be bank buddies.

184
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,842
Now there's two reasons.

185
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,139
Hey.

186
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:49,519
You guys, remember that cute client
I told you about?

187
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,853
I bit him.

188
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,775
-Where?
-On the tushy.

189
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,194
And that's not against your oath?

190
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,864
I know,
but the moment I touch him...

191
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:06,244
...I want to throw out my old oath
and take a new, dirty one.

192
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,164
Next time, try to distract yourself.

193
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,875
Like when I'm doing
something exciting...

194
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,045
...and I don't want to get too...

195
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,714
...excited.

196
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,759
I try and think of other things.
Like, uh, sandwiches...

197
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,761
...and, uh, baseball...

198
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,390
...and, uh, Chandler.

199
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,561
-Thank you.
-Oh, no, thank you.

200
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,863
All right, I'm here.
Let's get this over with.

201
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,115
Okay, uh, well...

202
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,242
...just follow my lead.

203
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,372
Don't we need to do some kind
of preparation first?

204
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,708
Like get really drunk?

205
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,587
Come on. Hey, just put
your arms around me.

206
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,763
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,016
No. It's okay.
But if I'm Marge...

208
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,226
...my breasts are coming out my back.

209
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,605
Ah, forget it!
I'm not being any good at this.

210
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,066
My mom was right.

211
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,110
I'm just a big potato
with arms and legs and a head.

212
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,948
Come on, man.
You're not a potato.

213
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,535
I'm sure as hell not a dancer.
It's no use.

214
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,330
Marge will never go for me.

215
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,958
Come on, Treeger.
Don't say that.

216
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,960
You just need more practice.

217
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,380
Come on. Let's try it again.

218
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,387
Plus, it was probably
mostly my fault anyway.

219
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,890
I'm not that comfortable
dancing with a— Whee-hee!

220
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,643
-Hey!
-Yeah.

221
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,899
So how goes the dancing?
Gay yet?

222
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,988
Ha-ha-ha. You guys owe me bigtime.

223
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,370
What was that?

224
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,749
-What?
-You just did a little dancy thing.

225
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,252
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

226
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,296
-You did a little hop.
-You are so enjoying this.

227
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,840
No, I'm not.

228
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,135
And it wasn't a hop.
It was a pas de bourree.

229
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,390
You know the words!

230
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,267
You are so into this!

231
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:38,896
Maybe I'm enjoying it a little.
I'm getting pretty good at it.

232
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:44,152
This is so sweet.
Joey, our little twinkletoes.

233
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,446
This isn't some kind of girly dance.

234
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,700
It's like a sport, it's manly.

235
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,828
-Show me some "manly" moves.
-All right.

236
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,375
I don't know how to lead.

237
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,050
-Hello.
-Hi.

238
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,386
We'd like to close our accounts.

239
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,139
Close your accounts?
Is there a problem?

240
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,934
-No, no.
-No, we'd just like to close them.

241
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,227
Okay....

242
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,022
Ms. Lambert handles all our closures.

243
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,232
Would you come over here, please?

244
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,235
Hi, I'm Karen.

245
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,238
I want to quit the bank!

246
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,578
<i>Okay. Baseball.</i>

247
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,457
<i>Rick playing baseball.
He slides into second.</i>

248
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,084
<i>Maybe even his pants
come down a little.</i>

249
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,753
<i>Oh, no, wait! No.</i>

250
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,589
<i>Okay, sandwiches.
Sandwiches. Urn....</i>

251
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,716
<i>Okay, on a plate.</i>

252
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,761
<i>Maybe Rick's pants come down a little.
No! No!</i>

253
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,555
<i>Chandler.</i>

254
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,892
<i>Okay, Chandler. Ooh, that's working!</i>

255
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,069
<i>Chandler's knees.</i>

256
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,405
<i>Chandler's ankles.</i>

257
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,616
<i>Chandler's ankle hair.</i>

258
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,243
<i>Oh, no!</i>

259
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,912
Okay, you're all set. Heh.

260
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,623
Oh, wow! That was amazing!

261
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,292
-Was that really just an hour?
-Yeah.

262
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,587
In really long hour-world.

263
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,922
What?

264
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,424
Ugh! Okay....

265
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,803
I have an enormous crush on you.

266
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,889
But since you're a client,
I can't ask you out...

267
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,934
...even though you give me
the feelings.

268
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,312
Wow. I had no idea.

269
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,231
But, uh....

270
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,525
I can always find another masseuse.

271
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,026
Really?

272
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,237
Yeah, really.

273
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,577
What?

274
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,162
Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.

275
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,666
Quiet down.

276
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,839
Mr. Simon's been waiting—
Oh, my God!

277
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,549
Why wasn't I offered that?

278
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,594
I'd definitely pay more for that.

279
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,765
We have rules here.
This is not that kind of place.

280
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,810
I know, but this isn't
how it looks at all...

281
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,563
...because Rick is, um, my husband.

282
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,315
Oh, really?

283
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,692
You'd better tell his other wife.

284
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,445
She called three times
asking where he is.

285
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,783
Yes, I will tell her.

286
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,205
-So you didn't leave the bank?
-No.

287
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,209
And somehow we ended up
with a joint checking account.

288
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,671
What will you ever use that for?

289
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,382
To pay for the gym.

290
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,594
Hey!

291
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,804
So I had a great day.

292
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,390
Rick and I hit it off.
We were making out.

293
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,852
Then my boss walked in
and fired me for being a whore.

294
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,103
What?

295
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,147
-You got fired?
-Oh, my gosh!

296
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,234
It's so weird. I have never
been fired from anything.

297
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,070
Sweetie.

298
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,324
I started walking around,
not knowing what to do next.

299
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:23,204
I started asking people on the street
if they wanted massages.

300
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,582
Then these policemen thought
I was a whore too.

301
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,585
It's really been a bad day,
whore-wise.

302
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,426
Hey, Duck. Is Chick here?

303
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,057
Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.

304
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,435
Ready for our last practice?

305
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,773
We're not getting that spin right,
because my place is small.

306
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,443
-Want to use our place?
-No, I had another idea.

307
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:37,987
We did it!

308
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,322
That was incredible!

309
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:44,076
That was amazing!
We totally nailed it!

310
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,246
Hey, listen.
Thanks a lot, Tribbiani. Heh.

311
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,623
Oh, my God! Look at the time.

312
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,917
I got to catch the bus to the ball.

313
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,587
Oh! Okay....

314
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,464
-Good luck.
-Yeah.

315
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:00,718
Unless you want to practice
the fox trot. Or the tango?

316
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,471
Aw, thanks, but no.

317
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,475
You see, I think I'm ready
to dance with girls.

318
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,351
Okay, heh....

319
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,854
-Go get them, Treeger.
-Right.

320
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,735
Hey, uh....

321
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,862
You want to come?
Marge has a friend.

322
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,114
-Really?
-Yeah.

323
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,992
You'd dance good with her.
She's the same size as me.

324
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,869
No, I'm good.

325
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,389
You've got great experience.

326
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,892
Let's see.
Reason for leaving last job?

327
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,894
They thought I was a whore.

328
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,274
Okay. We'll give you a call
if anything comes up.

329
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,237
Great. Thank you very much.
