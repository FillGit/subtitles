1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,340
-Hey.
-Hey. Wow, it is true what they say:

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,300
Pregnant bellies look like a drum.

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,012
Ha, ha.

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,767
Well, it's just I'm so pregnant
that my guitar doesn't fit anymore.

5
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,770
So I thought, till I'm not,
I'm gonna play my songs on this drum.

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,647
It sounds really cool.

7
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:25,275
Listen, listen. Ahem. Okay.

8
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,321
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

9
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,908
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

10
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,123
Wow, Pheebs, that sounds great.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,710
I know, I know! And I've only been playing
for, like, an hour.

12
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,882
-Phoebe. Phoebe. Hi.
-Hey.

13
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,092
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,594
Um, actually I came down
to ask you a big favor.

15
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,515
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep
more of your stuff in my uterus.

16
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,396
No, no, no. Okay. Now, see. Ahem.

17
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,940
I want to name the girl baby Leslie.

18
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:08,735
And, um, Frank wants to name
one of the boy babies...

19
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,696
...Frank Jr., Jr.

20
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:13,991
Wouldn't that be Frank III?

21
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,201
Don't get me started.

22
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,122
Anyway, um,
since there are three babies...

23
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,625
...and, um, we both got
to put our names in...

24
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,337
...we would be truly honored
if you would name the other boy baby.

25
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,131
Oh, wow.

26
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,675
-That's so nice. Oh, oh!
-Ha, ha.

27
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:32,884
Cougar.

28
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,221
You think about it.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,361
I left a bra drying on the shower rod.

30
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,447
You don't think your son
will think it's yours and be traumatized?

31
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,325
Hey, Mommy can have a wife.
Daddy can have a bra.

32
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,120
Oh, it's time to go.

33
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,748
Oh, no, no, no.
See, that clock's a little fast.

34
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:48,043
Uh, we still have 17 minutes.

35
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,296
Huh. What can we do in 17 minutes...

36
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,756
...twice?

37
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,926
Well, that's ambitious.

38
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,597
-Okay, you can ignore that.
-That's Carol with your son.

39
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,933
Uh, believe me, when he's older,
he'll understand.

40
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,479
-Ross.
-I'll be right there.

41
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,029
-Hello. Hello. Hey.
-Hi.

42
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,031
Uh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.

43
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,368
-Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you.
-You too.

44
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,329
Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial
in London next week.

45
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,081
I'm so excited. I've never been there.

46
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,083
-Oh, well, I'll show you around.
-Great.

47
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,753
Also, I was hoping to catch a show.
So if you can make any suggestions....

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,755
Oh, there's tons of terrific stuff.

49
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,258
-I'll go with you.
-Oh.

50
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,509
Oh, I'm sorry.

51
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,804
Oh. Look at you two bonding.

52
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,266
-Making us late for the airport so....
-Are you all right?

53
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,978
Oh, he's fine, he's fine. It's just
us getting along is difficult for him...

54
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,647
...because he doesn't like me.

55
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,566
Ha, ha. Come on. That's....

56
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,942
It's true.

57
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,033
-Hi.
-Hey. Hey, do we have a baby name yet?

58
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,453
Ugh, no. It's so hard.

59
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,080
I went through this whole book
and found nothing.

60
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,876
I want a name that's really, like,
you know, strong and confident.

61
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,961
You know? Like Exxon.

62
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,674
Well, it certainly worked
for that Valdez kid.

63
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,888
Oh, oh, Pheebs. You want a strong name?
How about The Hulk?

64
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,766
No, I'm not sure about Hulk...

65
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,685
...but I like the idea
of a name starting with "The."

66
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,522
Well, you want a good name,
heh, go with Joey.

67
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,524
Joey's your pal, Joey's your buddy.

68
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,110
Where is everybody?
They're hanging out with Joey.

69
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,530
Know what?
If you're gonna name him Joey...

70
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,574
...you should name him Chandler.

71
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,995
Oh, come on, Chandler's funny,
he's sophisticated, and he's very lovable...

72
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,539
...once you get to know him.

73
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,042
Hey, Joey's lovable too.

74
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,670
But the thing about Joey is,
if you need him, he'll be there.

75
00:04:55,837 --> 00:05:00,091
Chandler will be there for you too.
I mean, he might be a little late...

76
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,886
...but he'll be there.
And he'll bring you some cold soda...

77
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,515
...if what you need him for
is that you're really hot.

78
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,351
What do you say? What do you say?

79
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:14,064
Well, I like the idea of naming him
after someone I love.

80
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,317
And Joey and Chandler
are both great names.

81
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,574
All right, I don't-

82
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,868
Maybe I will just name him The Hulk.

83
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,624
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it.
That's what I wanted to name my kid.

84
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,588
Hey, Mon? If you were hoping to sleep
with Joshua for the first time tonight...

85
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,841
...which one of these
would you want to be wearing?

86
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,970
You know what? It really creeps me out
choosing other people's sex clothes.

87
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,598
Sorry. I'm just so excited.

88
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,560
I've been waiting for this for months.
I got my hair colored.

89
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,355
I got new sheets.
I'm making him a very fancy meal.

90
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,232
What am I making him, by the way?

91
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:02,070
Well, you're making him a frisee salad
with goat cheese and pine nuts...

92
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:06,074
...wild rice, roasted asparagus
and salmon en croute.

93
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,451
I thought I was making him filet mignon.

94
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,665
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make
salmon because you had some left over.

95
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,043
And then you realized if you bitched
about it, then you would stop cooking...

96
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,256
...and you would have to make your
famous baked potato and Diet Coke.

97
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,051
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.

98
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,638
-Hey.
-Hey.

99
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,056
Hey.

100
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,309
So, uh, Emily called last night.

101
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,352
And now you're giving me the message?

102
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:42,319
Turns out that Emily
is just crazy about Susan.

103
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,156
Yeah.
They're going to the theater together.

104
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,658
They're going to dinner.

105
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,077
They're going horseback riding.

106
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,706
God, Susan is so fun.

107
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,712
Look, this is just a little too familiar.

108
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,174
Okay, for, like, six months
before Carol and I split up...

109
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:08,511
...all I heard was,
"My friend Susan is so smart.

110
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,766
My friend Susan is so funny.
My friend Susan is so great."

111
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,020
You actually think that something
could happen between Emily and Susan?

112
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,065
Hey, they're going to the gym together.

113
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,068
Two women...

114
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,861
...stretching.

115
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,573
You know, they take a steam together,
things get a little playful.

116
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,492
Didn't you see <i>Personal Best?</i>

117
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,661
No, but I'm gonna.

118
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,165
Hi. Hi. You're crazy.

119
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,918
Okay, this is Emily. Emily is straight.

120
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,127
How do you know?

121
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,797
I mean, we thought Carol was straight
before I married her.

122
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,968
Yeah, definitely.
I don't like the name Ross.

123
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,890
What a weird way to kick me
when I'm down.

124
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,060
No, no, I just meant for the baby.

125
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,853
Oh.

126
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,440
What's wrong with Ross?

127
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,401
It's just, you know, something like this...

128
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,820
...would never happen to The Hulk,
you know.

129
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,615
Actually, that's not true.

130
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:15,412
In <i>The Incredible Hulk, </i>number 72,
Dr. Bruce Banner found....

131
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,500
You know, never mind.
My girlfriend's a lesbian.

132
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,464
So I decided I'm definitely gonna go
with either Joey or Chandler.

133
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,216
-Oh.
-Oh, oh, oh.

134
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,176
You gotta pick Joey.

135
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,887
I mean, name one famous person
named Chandler.

136
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,683
-Raymond Chandler.
-Someone you didn't make up.

137
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,937
Okay, there are no famous Joeys.
Except for, heh...

138
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,522
...Joey Buttafuoco.

139
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,568
-Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
-Yeah.

140
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,113
Well, how about a compromise then?
Okay, what if it's...

141
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,866
...you know, Chan-no-ey?

142
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,745
Okay, look, Joey? Come on, think about it.
He'll never be president.

143
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,372
I mean, there's never gonna be
a President Joey.

144
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,208
All right, look,
I didn't want to bring this up.

145
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,629
But Chandler is the stupidest name
I've heard in my life.

146
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,215
It's not even a name.
It's barely even a word.

147
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,760
Okay, it's kind of like chandelier
but it's not.

148
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,475
All right? It's a stupid, stupid,
non-name.

149
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,188
Wow.

150
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,859
You're right.
I have a horrible, horrible name.

151
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,157
I'm sorry, man. I didn't- I'm sorry.

152
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,535
So I guess it's Joey, then. I mean....

153
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,421
This is so nice.
Thank you for doing this.

154
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,674
Oh. Please. Cooking soothes me.

155
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,264
-So dig in.
-All right.

156
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,476
-Well, it all looks so good.
-Mm.

157
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,436
Mm.

158
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,688
Oh, my God.

159
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,191
Oh, I know. My God, this rice is so-

160
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,401
I am so good.

161
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,445
Behind you.

162
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,867
Oh, yeah, sorry. They used to live here,
and sometimes they migrate back over.

163
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,872
Is there, uh-? Is there some way
that they could, uh, not be here?

164
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,834
It's just that, uh, farm birds
really kind of freak me out.

165
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,046
-Yeah. Okay, okay.
-Okay, great.

166
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,340
Here we go. Here we go. Whoa.

167
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,593
-Whoa.
-Oh, sorry.

168
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,929
There you go.

169
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,399
Hey. How'd you do that?

170
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,900
Come on.

171
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,696
-All gone.
-Hen.

172
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,155
So, farm birds, huh?

173
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,576
Yeah, it's my only weird thing, I swear.

174
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,663
And I would have told you about it
but I didn't know that they'd be here.

175
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,917
-Oh.
-So, uh, ahem.

176
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,212
-Ha, ha.
-Okay.

177
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,840
So can I serve you a little-

178
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,300
What, what, what?

179
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:20,013
Nothing. Uh, it's just that I know
that they're still out there.

180
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,851
They're across the hall.
I mean, that's two doors away.

181
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,813
It's gonna take them a long time
to peck their way back over here.

182
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,567
That's not funny.

183
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,778
-Uh....
-Okay, you know....

184
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,407
Would you feel better
if we went someplace else?

185
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:43,453
I mean, we could pack all this stuff up
and, you know, go to your apartment.

186
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,747
Oh, they're working on it this week.
It's a mess.

187
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,917
But, uh, I'm staying at my parents' house.
We could go there.

188
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,710
-Your parents'?
-They're out of town.

189
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,587
Oh.

190
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:56,674
It's a huge place,
and it's got this gorgeous view of the park.

191
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,343
It'd be very, very romantic.

192
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,388
-What do you say?
-Yeah, that works.

193
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,017
They can smell the fear.

194
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,271
Hey.

195
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,564
How's Ben?

196
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,234
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat.
He said no.

197
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,779
I asked him if he wanted to sleep.
He said no.

198
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,907
I asked what he wanted to do.
He said no.

199
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,784
So he's sweeping.

200
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,162
Hey, buddy. Hey.

201
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,290
So, um, any word from Susan?

202
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,794
Ooh, yeah, she said she's having
so much fun with Emily.

203
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,921
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

204
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,968
Uh, by the by,
did it ever occur to you that...

205
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:44,180
...I don't know, maybe they might
be having a little too much fun?

206
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,640
What's too much fun?

207
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,310
You know, the kind of fun you
and Susan had when we were married.

208
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,689
Oh, my God. You are so paranoid.

209
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,482
-Am I?
-Yes.

210
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,192
Am I?

211
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,819
I can't speak for Emily...

212
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,613
...but Susan is in a loving,
committed relationship.

213
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,741
Uh-huh. Carol, so were we.

214
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,703
All right, just imagine for a moment...

215
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,248
...that Susan meets someone,
and they really hit it off.

216
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,583
Say they're coming back
from the theater...

217
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,378
...and they stop at a pub
for a couple of drinks.

218
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,839
They're laughing, you know.

219
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,383
Someone innocently touches
someone else.

220
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,760
There's electricity.

221
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,887
It's new. It's exciting.

222
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,558
Are you telling me
there isn't even the slightest possibility...

223
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,601
...of something happening?

224
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,688
-Maybe.
-Oh, my God.

225
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,899
I didn't really believe it
until you just said it.

226
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:46,242
None of the other kids believed me,
I swear to God, that duck pushed me.

227
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,079
Wow. This place is fabulous.

228
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,124
Yeah, let me show you around.
This is the downstairs living room.

229
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,126
There's two living rooms?

230
00:13:55,293 --> 00:14:00,048
God, growing up here, this place
must have been a real babe magnet.

231
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,551
Yeah, well, it would have been,
but, uh, my parents just moved here.

232
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:07,096
Well, you should know this place
is a real babe magnet.

233
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,432
Want to make out?

234
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,438
You know, here's an idea.
Why don't I put the food in the fridge...

235
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,149
...and we can eat it later?

236
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,276
-That sounds like a plan.
-Heh.

237
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,404
Um, is there a place
that I could go freshen up?

238
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:28,034
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, just down the hall
and, uh, second door to your left.

239
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,207
-Oh, hi, darling.
-Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?

240
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:38,294
-Oh, we cut the trip short.
-France sucks.

241
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:43,174
Um, this may be a little weird,
but I've got a date here.

242
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,634
Say no more.

243
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,929
We'll just grab some food, take it
with us upstairs and be out of your hair.

244
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,932
Oh, that'd be great.
So you didn't even get to Italy?

245
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,017
Yep. Sucks.

246
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,292
Hi, you.

247
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,671
Oh, my God.

248
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,966
I know. I can do more than cook.

249
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,593
Uh....

250
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,767
I like her. She seems smart.

251
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,608
Rachel, my parents.

252
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,696
So nice to meet you. Hello, hello.

253
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:52,452
Oh, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.

254
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:58,875
What, this? Oh, no. That's not what it is.

255
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,877
Okay, I work in fashion.

256
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,922
See, and this is a real dress, actually.

257
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,176
They're wearing it in Milan.

258
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:12,722
So part of my job is to wear the clothes
and then I see how people respond.

259
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:17,768
And then I report back to my superiors
at Bloomingdale's, so....

260
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,480
And obviously, in this case...

261
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,399
...I am going to report back:

262
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,736
"U.S.A. not ready."

263
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,572
-Maybe in L.A.
-Yes.

264
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,825
-There you go.
-So have you kids eaten yet?

265
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,536
Well, ahem, we were going to do that after.
I mean, um....

266
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,998
-Next.
-Well, we're starving.

267
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,792
Why don't we just all
go get something to eat?

268
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:47,840
Yeah, well, ha, ha, no use wasting this baby
just lying around the house.

269
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,385
-So we'll go eat.
-Yeah.

270
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,262
You'll wear that.

271
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,766
We'll be eating and, of course,
you'll be wearing that.

272
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,938
Dude, I am sorry about what I said.

273
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,107
Nope, nope, you're right.
It is a ridiculous name.

274
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,611
-It's not that bad.
-Yes, it is.

275
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,323
From now on, I have no first name.

276
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,452
So you're just Bing?

277
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,289
I have no name.

278
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,251
So, what are we supposed to call you?

279
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,004
Okay, uh, for now, temporarily,
you can call me...

280
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,173
...Clint.

281
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,553
No way are you cool enough
to pull off "Clint."

282
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,055
Okay, so, what name am I
cool enough to pull off?

283
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,057
Um, Gene.

284
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,230
It's Clint. It's Clint.

285
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,649
-See you later, Gene.
-Bye, Gene.

286
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,653
It's Clint. Clint!

287
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,366
What's up with Gene?

288
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,789
-You wore your nightie to dinner?
-Oh, yeah.

289
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,835
And the best part though, was when
the waiter spilled water down my back.

290
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,129
I jumped up and my boob popped out.

291
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,089
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, no.

292
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,091
Yeah, it's all right. I got nice boobs.

293
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,805
So I just picked up
a message from Emily.

294
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,392
She and Susan are going
to a poetry reading together.

295
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,769
-So?
-So?

296
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,730
Poetry?

297
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,107
Susan's gay.

298
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,610
They're being gay together.

299
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:35,114
-Emily's straight.
-Oh, wake up.

300
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,742
Wow.

301
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,286
Carol really messed you up.

302
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,871
Excuse me?

303
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:48,294
She turned you into this untrusting,
crazy, jealous sycophant.

304
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,759
All right, so I don't know what "sycophant"
means, but the rest is right.

305
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,430
I don't know what you're talking about.
I am not a crazy, jealous person.

306
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,973
Huh.

307
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,477
-What?
-She's totally right.

308
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,355
When we were together,
you got all freaked out about Mark...

309
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,066
-...and there was nothing going on.
-This makes sense.

310
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,734
It does not.

311
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,737
Sure it does. In high school,
you weren't jealous at all...

312
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,698
...even though all your girlfriends
were cheating on you.

313
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,745
All right, so up until '92, '93,
he was very trusting.

314
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:26,540
Then '94 hit, Carol left him,
and bam. Paranoid City.

315
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah.

316
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,502
Absolutely, absolutely.

317
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,836
This is so much fun.

318
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,881
This is not fun.

319
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,843
Look, all we're trying to say is...

320
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,639
...don't let what happened with Carol
ruin what you've got with Emily.

321
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,851
The '92 Ross wouldn't.

322
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:54,360
I still think I was right
about that whole Mark thing, though.

323
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,155
Wha-? Well, you know what?
I hope Emily is a lesbian.

324
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,997
Drum roll.

325
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,874
Okay. Okay.

326
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,584
All right.

327
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:15,464
Help. Am I a Mark or a John?

328
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,301
Ehh, you're not tall enough to be a Mark.

329
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,263
But you might make a good Barney.

330
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,266
All right, look, I am serious.

331
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,893
Tomorrow at 3:30,
I'm going to the courthouse.

332
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,728
You're actually going through with this?

333
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,648
Hey, look, this name has been
holding me back my entire life.

334
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:36,652
Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me
and why I never do well with women.

335
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,573
So as of 4:00 tomorrow, I'm either gonna be
Mark Johnson or John Markson.

336
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,202
You've got problems because of you,
not your name.

337
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:51,041
This has got to stop.
Chandler is a great name.

338
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,877
In fact....

339
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,463
Yes.

340
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,841
I'm sorry, I know you really wanted me
to name the baby Joey.

341
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:03,262
But- So I'm gonna name
the baby Chandler.

342
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,266
Really?

343
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,477
Yeah, but you have to
keep the name too.

344
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,021
-Okay, thanks.
-Okay.

345
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,148
-You want to hug it out?
-Yeah.

346
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,568
-Yay, yay. Oh, yay!
-Yay.

347
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,820
Okay, I'm gonna go tell
Frank and Alice right now.

348
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,197
Okay.

349
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,492
-Bye, Pheebs.
-Okay, bye.

350
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,495
-Ha, ha.
-Oh.

351
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,009
<i>Flight 004 is now arriving at Gate 17.</i>

352
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,140
-Nice luggage.
-I was going to say.

353
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,560
-Hey.
-Hi.

354
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,648
-I missed you.
-Oh, I missed you too.

355
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,525
Thanks for everything, I had a great time.

356
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,652
Oh, so did I.

357
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,072
No tongue.
