1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:06,590
-Thanks for the tasty dinner.
-You're welcome for a tasty dinner.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,759
What are you guys looking at?

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,553
Ross and the most
beautiful girl in the world.

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,597
Yeah, come to Papa!

5
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,437
I know!

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,524
Probably the only time
I'll say this...

7
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,069
...but did you see the ass on her?

8
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,571
What did you...?
When did you...?

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,741
How did you...?
How did you get a girl like that?

10
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:38,247
So what is she, like a spokesmodel?
An aerobics instructor?

11
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,792
Actually, she's a paleontology
doctoral candidate...

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,169
...specializing in the Cenozoic Era.

13
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,047
But that's, like, the easiest era.

14
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,343
I've seen her at work,
but I always figured....

15
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,265
But, uh, I made her dinner.

16
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,977
We had a great time.
And we're going out again tomorrow.

17
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:06,358
Maybe her friends are betting to see
who gets the biggest geek.

18
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,944
Fine by me. Hope she wins.

19
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,161
Hey!

20
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,204
You have any wrapping paper?

21
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,040
Is it for my birthday present?

22
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,876
It was your birthday months ago.

23
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,214
You said you ordered something special
and it just hadn't come yet.

24
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,093
I have a call in about that.

25
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,304
Oh. Okay.

26
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,391
It's for Kathy. It's an early copy
of her favorite book.

27
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,102
Oh! <i>The Velveteen Rabbit!</i>

28
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,064
When the boy's love
makes the rabbit real....

29
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,692
Don't touch it, because
your fingers have destructive oils.

30
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,780
Then you'd better keep it away
from Ross' hair.

31
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,242
This is pretty rare.
How did you get that?

32
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,079
No big deal.
I just went to some bookstores...

33
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,583
...talked to some dealers, called
some of the author's grandchildren.

34
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,502
Honey, that's so sweet.

35
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:53,423
What a great way to say, "I secretly
love you, roommate's girlfriend."

36
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,093
It doesn't say that.

37
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,761
Does it?

38
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,724
How will it look when you get her
something incredibly meaningful...

39
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,937
...and expensive, and her boyfriend,
Joey, gives her an orange?

40
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,774
I'll make sure Joey gets her
something really great.

41
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,110
It's got to be better than that book.

42
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,153
Ooh! Like a crossbow!

43
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,116
Once again, I am sorry.

44
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,118
Thank you. Bye.

45
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,123
I had to turn down a job
catering a funeral for 60 people.

46
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,292
Oh, my God! What happened?

47
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,461
Sixty guests.

48
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,134
Why'd you have to turn it down?

49
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,636
I don't have the money or equipment...

50
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,306
...to handle something that big
on such short notice.

51
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,809
Wow, what is with all the negativity?

52
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,312
You sound like "Moni-can't,"
not "Moni-can"!

53
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,566
Moni-ca.

54
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,571
You've been playing around
with this catering for years.

55
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,407
-Do you want to be a caterer?
-I don't know.

56
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,576
There you go! That's the spirit!

57
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:08,081
If you need money, I will lend
you money. Just get moving!

58
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,835
Really? I'd need $500
for all the food and supplies.

59
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:16,673
It's worth it if it'll get you moving.
You haven't worked in months!

60
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,883
Neither have you.

61
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,510
Yes, but I'm doing this.

62
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,221
That would be great! Thank you.

63
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,308
-Hey!
-Hey!

64
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,811
Can I borrow your apartment keys?

65
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,021
Why?

66
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,859
You can pee here.

67
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:43,033
Ha-ha-ha. Yes, I can, of course.
Excuse me.

68
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,369
It's okay.
The duck's using our bathroom anyway.

69
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,875
What are you getting
for her birthday?

70
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,711
We've been dating a couple weeks.
I got to get her something?

71
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,004
Yes!

72
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,965
Yes! You have to get her
something really nice.

73
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,260
-I know!
-And not one of your coupons...

74
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,262
...for an hour of "Joey Love."

75
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,603
Ooh! A crossword! Can I help?

76
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,063
No!

77
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,607
Last week I got all
but three answers...

78
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,401
...and I want to finish one
without any help.

79
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,819
Fine.

80
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,740
But you can't help me develop
my new universal language.

81
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,868
-Hey!
-How'd it go?

82
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,080
Oh, my God!
It was the best funeral ever!

83
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,916
Everyone loved the food.

84
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,585
I even got another funeral
for tomorrow.

85
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,088
The dead guy from today's best friend.

86
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,133
It's like I am the official caterer
for that accident.

87
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,302
Mon, I'm so happy for you!

88
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,264
Thanks.
Check out my new catering stuff.

89
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,766
Look! I'm an omelet station!

90
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,853
-Omelet? Made to order?
-Ha!

91
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,480
I'll have one, please.
Plus my money.

92
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,024
Oh....

93
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,610
I didn't realize
you needed it right away.

94
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,322
You told me to go and be a caterer.
So I went. I be'd.

95
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,993
I used it to buy all this stuff.

96
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,621
I got another job tomorrow,
so I'll pay you back then.

97
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,125
Oh! Okay.
Sorry I acted like a bank.

98
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,680
Um, would you like to come in?

99
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:33,184
Did <i>Homo erectus </i>hunt
with wooden tools?

100
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,605
According to recent findings.

101
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,243
Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!

102
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,663
Uh, Mitzi is...?

103
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,665
My hamster.

104
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,835
I hope she's okay.
I haven't seen her in a while.

105
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,879
Have a seat.

106
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,464
<i>Where?</i>

107
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,675
Uh, oh! Do you, uh-?

108
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,224
Do you have any, um,
Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

109
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,019
-What?
-Well, I do.

110
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,523
Let's go back to my place,
light a couple candles...

111
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,527
...break open a box
of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties...?

112
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,199
-I'd rather not.
-Oh, yeah? Why not?

113
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:33,036
Okay, um....
Don't take this the wrong way...

114
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,706
...but your place kind of
has a weird smell.

115
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,217
-Is everything in the car?
-Did you settle the bill?

116
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,719
No. I hate this part.

117
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,014
Ooh! Oh! Look what we almost left!

118
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,225
-That's not mine.
-Oh.

119
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,727
Ooh. Look what we almost took!

120
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,736
Excuse me, Ms. Burkart?

121
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,905
Well, we're all cleaned up.

122
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,534
Oh. Good. Thank you.

123
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,537
Um, ahem....

124
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,916
And, well, there's
this small matter of the, um....

125
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,752
-Dear?
-The matter of...

126
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,171
...payment.

127
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:30,093
Jack used to handle the finances.

128
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,274
You know what we should all do?

129
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,609
Go see a musical.

130
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,613
Sure.

131
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,324
You know which one?

132
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,495
The 1996 Tony Award winner.

133
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,332
Do you know the name of that one?

134
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,127
I don't know, um, <i>Grease?</i>

135
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,172
No.

136
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,341
<i>Rent?</i>

137
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,635
Yes! <i>Rent!</i>

138
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,096
So when do you want to go?

139
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,724
What? I'm sorry. I can't, I'm busy.

140
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,979
Hey....

141
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:27,567
Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. Ugh!

142
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,820
Yes, it is, at Office Max!

143
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,407
What did you get her?

144
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,494
A pen.

145
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,916
It's two gifts in one.
It's a pen that's also a clock. Huh?

146
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,836
-Ha, ha. You can't give her that.
-Why not?

147
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,338
She's not 11!

148
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,675
And it's not the seventh night
of Chanukah.

149
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,182
What he means by that is,
while this is a very nice gift...

150
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,018
...maybe it's not something
a boyfriend gives.

151
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,520
Sure, it is.

152
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,021
She needs a pen for work.

153
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,776
She's writing. She turns it over.
"Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"

154
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:16,074
All right. What did you get
for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?

155
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,368
She didn't have one.

156
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,870
For three years?

157
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,209
Look, it's too late,
and I got an audition.

158
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,419
I can't shop anymore.

159
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,383
I will go out
and try to find something for her.

160
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,218
Thanks, man.

161
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,555
While you're at it,
could you get her a card?

162
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,433
Would you like me to write her
a little poem as well?

163
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,062
Or just get a card
that has a poem already in it.

164
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,235
-Oh! You have to get our money.
-She couldn't stop crying.

165
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,947
With those thick glasses,
her tears look giant.

166
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,615
I know, it's tough.

167
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,994
You know what the first thing I did
after my mom's funeral was?

168
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,079
-What?
-Pay the caterer!

169
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,582
I've had a lot of jobs.

170
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,752
And there are some people
who always try to get out of paying.

171
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,589
It's either "That massage
wasn't long enough"...

172
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,091
...or "I don't know
any of those songs"...

173
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:19,304
...or "These sombreros aren't
big enough. Bad little white girl!"

174
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,639
Okay.

175
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,600
So you think she's faking?

176
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,437
There weren't any tears
till you showed her the bill.

177
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,606
She sounded pretty upset to me.

178
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,442
<i>You're a grand old flag</i>

179
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,738
<i>You're a high-flying flag
And forever in peace may you wave</i>

180
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,449
She seems fine now.

181
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,334
So you just left?
Her place was really that bad?

182
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,254
You throw your jacket on a chair
at the end of the day.

183
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:57,300
Like that, only instead of a chair,
it's a pile of garbage.

184
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,888
And instead of a jacket,
it's a pile of garbage.

185
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,768
And instead of the end of
the day, it's the end of time...

186
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,270
...and garbage is all
that has survived.

187
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,816
-Here.
-Wow. Thanks.

188
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,194
So, uh, what happened?

189
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,696
Nothing. I had to get out of there.

190
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,324
Next time, you take her
to your place.

191
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,327
I tried that.
She says it has a weird smell.

192
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,831
-What kind of smell?
-I don't know. Soap?

193
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,793
-Listen, you like this girl, right?
-Yeah.

194
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,920
-You want to see her again?
-Yeah.

195
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,881
So you're going to have
to do it in the mess!

196
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,677
Yeah, okay. You're right.

197
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,347
I mean, uh, who cares about
a little sloppiness?

198
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,182
Yeah.

199
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,851
-It's endearing, really.
-All right!

200
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,063
Now you go get that beautiful pig!

201
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,451
I just spent the entire
afternoon looking for a present...

202
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,496
...for Kathy that would be
better than the rabbit.

203
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:09,664
Any luck?

204
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:14,252
Yeah, I found this great place
called "Invisible Things for Kathy."

205
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,380
Can you give me a hand
with all this stuff?

206
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,217
Just return the book,
let Joey give her the clock pen...

207
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,220
...and you get her
something worse than that...

208
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,763
...like a regular pen.

209
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,767
She's really going
to love this, you know?

210
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,062
The bottom line is,
I want her to have it...

211
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,607
...even if I don't get to be
the one who gives it to her.

212
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,776
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.

213
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,238
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?

214
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,282
Oh, "pathetic"!

215
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,496
Hey! I've been looking
all over for you.

216
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,000
-Where?
-Our place. The hall.

217
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,921
I got something.

218
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,680
It's a book.

219
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,766
A book?

220
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,770
Is it a book that's also a safe?

221
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,024
It's a book that's just a book.

222
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:22,111
It's <i>The Velveteen Rabbit.
</i>It was her favorite as a kid.

223
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,822
So, uh, just let me know
if she likes it, okay?

224
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,115
You got it.

225
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,618
Thanks for doing this. I owe you one.

226
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,500
There wasn't any change
from that twenty, was there?

227
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,003
No, it came out to an even twenty.

228
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,800
Wow. That's almost
as much as a new book.

229
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,099
<i>Jeepers Creepers</i>

230
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,975
<i>Where'd you get those peepers?</i>

231
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,771
<i>Jeepers Creepers
Where'd you get those eyes?</i>

232
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:57,939
You didn't get the money?

233
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,650
Maybe I can try at intermission?

234
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,319
You know what? Let's just go.

235
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,572
No! Hey!
We're not leaving till we get paid!

236
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,866
I don't know who she thinks she is.

237
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,952
Enough is enough!

238
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,454
Hey, widow?

239
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,792
Widow? Excuse me? Excuse me!

240
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:24,340
Thanks. Um, clearly this is
a very, very hard time for you.

241
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,844
Um, but we provided a service,
and we deserve to be paid...

242
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,971
...because you ate that service.

243
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,475
We are not leaving here until
we are paid every penny, because...

244
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,855
...we're part-time caterers
and we have no place else to go.

245
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,567
All right. I'll get my bag.

246
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,068
Good.

247
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,412
I'm going to leave some cards here.

248
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,709
Please think of us
for your next event.

249
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,383
You want to come inside?

250
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,760
Yes.

251
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,806
Yes, I do.

252
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,277
I'll be right back.
Make yourself comfortable.

253
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,638
-Guess who.
-Uh....

254
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,349
Department of Sanitation?

255
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,228
-It's me.
-Ha, oh!

256
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,490
Aw!

257
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,492
What?

258
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,495
-Oh, Cheryl!
-Oh, Ross!

259
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,207
Oh! Oh!

260
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,839
Oh! God!

261
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,510
Aah! Oh, my God!

262
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,599
No! No!

263
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,394
It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!

264
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,314
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
I must have freaked out.

265
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,108
Thank God it's not Mitzi!

266
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,986
It's just a rat.

267
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,491
I did it! Aah!

268
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,744
I finished it! I did it all by myself!

269
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,871
And there's nobody to hug.

270
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,791
Move!

271
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,215
Hey! Hey, you guys!

272
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,634
I finished it all by myself!
Hug me.

273
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,428
Yay! So good!

274
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,222
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

275
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,640
How did it go?

276
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,853
The widow wouldn't pay, so
Phoebe yelled at her till she did.

277
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,230
I'm a hard-ass.

278
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,527
And I'm a wuss.
We should be partners.

279
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,530
Hard-ass and wuss.
We could fight crime.

280
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,200
Wait a minute, Phoebe.

281
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,411
We should be partners.

282
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,747
We should be catering partners.

283
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,709
You're not working now,
and we have a great time together.

284
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,587
-Okay.
-I cook and you take care of the money.

285
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,964
Oh! It'll be like
I have a wife in the '50s!

286
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,804
-Hey.
-Hey!

287
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,723
How did she like the gift?

288
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,809
She loved it.
She's showing the girls right now.

289
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,227
Yeah? That's great.

290
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,771
I got to tell you...

291
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,899
...I feel bad taking credit
for this, because...

292
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,151
...am I going to get
a lot of credit for this!

293
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,783
-Hey.
-Hey.

294
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,118
Hey. Happy birthday.

295
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,745
Thank you.

296
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,247
You know, uh,
Chandler got you a gift too.

297
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,084
No, he didn't.

298
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,339
Yeah, he did. Look,
it's right there on the counter. Ho, ho!

299
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,764
Happy birthday.

300
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,016
I'm sorry.

301
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,270
You really didn't have to.

302
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,273
-Wow!
-See....

303
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,820
You think it's just a pen, but you
turn it over and it's also a clock.

304
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,781
Really? No, this is great!

305
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,034
-Thank you, Chandler.
-Oh. Yeah.

306
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,120
Aw. Hen.

307
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,372
Want to go to bed?

308
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,458
I'll be in, in a minute.

309
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,132
Oh, uh.... Don't forget your coupon.

310
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,472
Good night.

311
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,476
Um, thank you for the gift.

312
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:32,648
Oh, uh, I just knew that
sometimes when you're writing...

313
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,651
...you don't always
know the exact time.

314
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,322
No, I didn't mean the pen.
Thank you for the book.

315
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,908
Uh, the book?

316
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,702
<i>The Velveteen Rabbit?</i>

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,830
I have a feeling you had
something to do with it.

318
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,290
What do you mean?

319
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,834
When Joey gave it to me he said:

320
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:56,589
"This is because I know you like rabbits,
and I know you like cheese."

321
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,177
Thanks. I love it.

322
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,387
I know how hard
it must have been for you to find.

323
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,685
In case you missed that,
that sound was, "Oh, well."

324
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,731
You must really like Joey
to go to all that trouble.

325
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,441
Oh, yeah. He's my-

326
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,698
He's my best friend.

327
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,869
-Well....
-Good night.

328
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,423
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.

329
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,395
Hi, uh, you don't know me.
I'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.

330
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,857
You know, it's too bad
that didn't work out.

331
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,401
Anyway, he told me
about your apartment.

332
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,571
Well, I couldn't sleep
thinking about it.

333
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,826
So, uh, would it be okay
if I cleaned it?

334
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,121
No?
