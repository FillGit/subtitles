1
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,588
-Hey.
-Hey.

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,757
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,676
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos
in his mouth.

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,012
Fifteen?

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,181
Your personal best! Ha, ha.

6
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,016
Mm-mm. Mm.

7
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,437
Where were you?

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,772
On a date.

9
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,441
I met this girl on a train
going to a museum upstate.

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,569
-Which museum?
-How'd you meet her?

11
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,863
No. Answer his.

12
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,950
We were at the back of the train.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,536
I sat near the door
so she'd have to pass by me...

14
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:40,749
...if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.

15
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,253
Were you so late because
you were burying this woman?

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,047
I'm late because
she lives in Poughkeepsie.

17
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:50,634
She seems great,
but she's two and a half hours away.

18
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,263
How can she be great
if she's from Poughkeepsie? Ha-ha-ha.

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,808
That joke would have killed
in Albany.

20
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,727
Done! I did it.

21
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,438
Who's stupid now?

22
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,451
Look! They're lighting
the big Christmas tree tonight.

23
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,661
Um, that paper is two weeks old.

24
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,333
Who keeps leaving old newspapers
in the trash?

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,630
I really wanted
to take Kathy to this.

26
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,966
At least you have somebody
to miss stuff with.

27
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,385
I hate being alone
this time of year.

28
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,763
Next it's Valentine's Day...

29
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,890
...then my birthday, then bang!

30
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,893
Then they're lighting
that damn tree again.

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,605
I want somebody!

32
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,319
You know, I want a man!

33
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:41,370
It doesn't even have to be
a big relationship. Just a fling!

34
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,748
I didn't think girls ever
just wanted a fling.

35
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,002
Let me tell you, it's been
a long time since I've been flung.

36
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,672
I know what I'm giving you
for Christmas.

37
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,012
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?

38
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,430
Yeah.

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,810
I've been single a long time.
Why haven't you offered before?

40
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,688
I have a girlfriend.
I'm happy.

41
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,567
I no longer go out of my way
to stop others from being happy.

42
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,736
Okay.

43
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,530
No accountants.

44
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,200
And no one from "legal."
I don't like boring jobs.

45
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,995
And Ross was what?
A lion tamer?

46
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,501
What's wrong, Mon?

47
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,129
Everybody at work still hates me.

48
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,505
I was making headway.

49
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,925
Everyone was smiling at me,
and then I get off work...

50
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,345
...and find out they wrote this
on my chefs hat.

51
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,145
Maybe they meant to write
"Quiet, Bitch."

52
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,609
What's the matter?

53
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,446
Fine! Just trying to be nice.

54
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,826
I haven't been picked on this much
since kindergarten.

55
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:07,038
And they brought in someone from
junior high to do the see-saw with me.

56
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,543
Aw.

57
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,840
They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I would.

58
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,009
But I've waited for this
my whole life.

59
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:23,054
Wait, you're the boss.
Yell at them. Or fire them!

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,934
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.

61
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,519
You know what you can do?

62
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,023
I read about this director,
Orson Welles...

63
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:37,235
...who, at the beginning, would
hire somebody just to fire them.

64
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,197
Then they would all know who was boss.

65
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,534
I'm not doing anything.
Why not fire me?

66
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,206
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?

67
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,124
Good enough to get fired.

68
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,919
All right. You're hired!

69
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,545
Hey!

70
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:01,426
That's why I got fired last week!
Does Orson Welles direct commercials?

71
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,724
Yes.

72
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,779
I say, Drew?
Are you seeing anybody right now?

73
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,073
I'm not asking for me.

74
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,993
I'm not gay.
I'm not asking you out.

75
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,870
I'm not gay.

76
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,289
I didn't think you were gay.

77
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,041
I do now.

78
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,421
My friend, Rachel,
wants to be set up.

79
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,216
I just got out of
a big relationship.

80
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,385
I'm not looking to get serious.

81
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,972
That's okay. A fling
might be all right with her.

82
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is this "Hot Rachel"
that you took to the Christmas Party?

83
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,312
By the way, that is her full name.

84
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,731
Wow! I'm free for her.

85
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,401
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.

86
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,445
Let's talk it over
at the Ranger game.

87
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,824
Hold on.
I just got a box of Cubans.

88
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,535
I'll bring them
by your office at 5.

89
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,623
That's a little later
than I usually stay, but sure.

90
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,752
Before the game, we could enjoy
some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.

91
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,839
I don't know what that is,
but let's!

92
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,639
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.
Do you want to hear it?

93
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,808
-Yeah!
-Yes!

94
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,686
Okay.

95
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,316
<i>Happy Hanukkah, Monica</i>

96
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,487
<i>May your Christmas be snowy, Joey</i>

97
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,532
<i>Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross</i>

98
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:51,036
<i>Spin the dreidel, Rachel</i>

99
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,291
-Pheebs, that's great!
-Oh, yay!

100
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,420
But you know, uh,
Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.

101
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:05,508
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

102
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,012
What are you talking about?
Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:

103
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,558
Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.

104
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,226
Maypole.

105
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,355
All good. Thanks.

106
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,777
Um, do you, maybe, have a nickname
that's easier to rhyme?

107
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,279
-Didn't your dad call you "Pumpkin"?
-Oh, yeah.

108
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,075
But did he ever call you
"Budolph"?

109
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,246
-Hello, children.
-Hey.

110
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,958
Have I got the 50 guys for you!

111
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,752
Really?

112
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,754
I showed them your picture.

113
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,966
Guys are throwing themselves at me
and giving me stuff.

114
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,968
-Knicks tonight?
-Where are the seats?

115
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,178
Wherever! I've got 20.

116
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,265
Will I like any of these guys?

117
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,393
You know, I'm going to, uh...

118
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,062
-...play the field a little bit more.
-Chandler....

119
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,441
Guys are signing over
their 401 Ks to me.

120
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,778
You work with robots?

121
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:11,574
Yes.

122
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:18,081
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.

123
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,999
I like swimmers' bodies.

124
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,003
His dad made the magnetic strip
on credit cards.

125
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:24,838
I like credit cards!

126
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,049
I'm not bad at this!

127
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,927
-What does he do?
-He works in fine foods.

128
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,598
-You have a fine foods division?
-It's a big company....

129
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,893
Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?

130
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,732
No, the robots just work for them.

131
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,985
All right, I'm going to work.

132
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,529
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

133
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,865
Yeah, lady. I do!

134
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,158
I got a problem!

135
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,493
I'll give you a problem!

136
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,787
What will you do?
Fire me?

137
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,457
You bet your ass I'll fire you!

138
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,417
See you later.

139
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,467
I should go.
I've got a date.

140
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,843
With who?

141
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,138
You know the girl
who lives in Poughkeepsie?

142
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,639
Not her.

143
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,225
This is someone else.

144
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,936
I can't decide between the two.

145
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,608
The one from Poughkeepsie, though
two hours away, is pretty...

146
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,277
...really smart and a lot of fun.

147
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:33,490
But this other girl,
she lives right uptown.

148
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,869
She's just as pretty.

149
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,829
I guess she's smart.

150
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,373
She's not fun.

151
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,086
If she's no fun,
why date her at all?

152
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:51,049
I want to give her a chance.
She lives so close.

153
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,929
And, at the end of the date,
she said something that...

154
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,224
...if she was kidding,
was very funny.

155
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:04,479
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.
She's stupid and racist.

156
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,358
-Hey.
-Hey.

157
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,694
How was your first day
at the restaurant?

158
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,738
Damn!

159
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,080
-Hey.
-Hey.

160
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,374
What happened to your fancy jacket?

161
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,251
They baked it.

162
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,794
I can't take this anymore.

163
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,172
-I'm going to fire you tonight.
-You got it. Oh, oh!

164
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,715
What are you doing?

165
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,635
You're still on fire there.

166
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,180
I think you got it!

167
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,147
Chandler, you have
the best taste in men.

168
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,441
Like father, like son.

169
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,362
Patrick and I had such
a great time last night!

170
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,906
This could, maybe, get serious.

171
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:01,119
I thought you weren't looking
for serious. Just a fling?

172
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,997
Well, you know, possibly.

173
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,794
You didn't tell him that,
though, right?

174
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,839
Uh, no?

175
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,594
You told this guy that
I was looking for a fling?

176
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,096
-You don't tell him that!
-Why not?

177
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,599
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl-

178
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,808
I see.

179
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,813
You telling him I want a fling
and me putting out...

180
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,941
...he's so going to get
the wrong idea!

181
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,406
Joey, could you pass the cheese?

182
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,285
I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.

183
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,914
I thought it might be fun
to try out a cool nickname.

184
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,123
Hey, Dragon!

185
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,378
Here's your tips
from Monday and Tuesday.

186
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,298
There's $300 in this one.

187
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,009
People get generous
around the holidays.

188
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,596
And it never hurts
to wear tight trousers.

189
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,976
Could the waiters listen
to the specials?

190
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:11,022
There's Chilean sea bass
with a mango relish-

191
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,274
Why is nobody writing these?

192
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,817
We can remember them.

193
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,197
Because you'll make up fake specials
and make me cook them?

194
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,158
Sure, that too.

195
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,914
Forget the specials for a minute.
Urn, here's the thing....

196
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,501
For the last two weeks I have, uh...

197
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,339
...tried hard to create
a positive atmosphere.

198
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,007
Can't hear you!

199
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,928
Positive atmosphere.

200
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,764
But I've had it up to here.

201
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,521
From now on,
it is going to be my way...

202
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,400
...or the highway. All right?

203
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,153
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

204
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,372
Hey, new guy.

205
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,835
I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?

206
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,963
No, ma'am.

207
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,092
He has a name. It's Dragon.

208
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,888
You want to know your name?
Check your hat.

209
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,433
We did the hat, right?

210
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,898
-What the hell just happened?
-I am so sorry.

211
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,525
I was going to do it.

212
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,362
But I was standing there
with $327 in one hand...

213
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,907
...and $238 in the other.
And I was thinking...

214
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,577
...it's been a long time since I had...

215
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,622
...327 plus $238!

216
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,753
We had a deal! It's why you're here.
I've got to fire you!

217
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,422
And I got to pay rent!

218
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,593
How about you don't fire me.

219
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,429
Instead, I stay.
I gain their trust.

220
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:10,016
They'll listen to the nice things
I say about you.

221
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,602
What nice things?

222
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:16,314
Nothing yet. They hate you,
and I want to fit in.

223
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,651
<i>Happy Hanukkah,
Chandler and Monica, Merry, merry-</i>

224
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,904
You know what, Pheebs?

225
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,907
I'm not Jewish so....

226
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,535
Ross doesn't decorate his tree
with floss...

227
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,788
...but he's not complaining.

228
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,418
Bad dream?

229
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,253
I wasn't sleeping.

230
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,965
What was Phoebe's song about?

231
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,095
It's the one with the cat.

232
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,682
I got to go.
I've got another date.

233
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,643
Did you pick one yet?

234
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,772
It turns out the one
from uptown was making a joke.

235
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,151
It was a different joke.
It wasn't that funny.

236
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,654
So I'm still torn.

237
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,989
You don't like the one from uptown.

238
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,992
And you're exhausted
from dating Poughkeepsie.

239
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,078
Just end them both!

240
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,997
Go to Poughkeepsie
and break up with her.

241
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,999
Then break up with uptown.

242
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,836
By the time you get home,
you're done!

243
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,256
You're right. Thank you.

244
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,593
I had a similar problem
when I lived in Prague.

245
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,681
-Prague?
-So much you don't know.

246
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,028
Chandler?

247
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,656
Patrick just, uh, ended things with me.

248
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:53,953
Did you or didn't you tell him
I wanted a serious relationship?

249
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,247
I did! I absolutely did!

250
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,249
You idiot!

251
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,751
I'm sure you're right.
But why?

252
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:05,882
You don't tell a guy that
you want a serious relationship.

253
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,050
Now you scared him away!

254
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,262
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

255
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,473
You should never be allowed
to talk to people!

256
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,934
I know, I know!

257
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,146
Now I'm right back where I started.

258
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,898
This sucks!

259
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,150
Being alone sucks!

260
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,736
You'll meet somebody.

261
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,905
You're a great catch!

262
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:33,910
When I told those guys about you,
I didn't have to lie once.

263
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,662
-Really?
-Yeah.

264
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,416
You graduated magna cum laude, right?

265
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,376
No.

266
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,587
It doesn't matter.

267
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:51,260
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?

268
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,347
Cute guys in little shorts?

269
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,848
Sure.

270
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:02,104
Actually, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.

271
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,732
That sounds fun too.
Thank you.

272
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,067
Okay.

273
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,240
Have you ever been with a woman?

274
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,992
What?

275
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,370
What is the matter with you?

276
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,207
There is no good time
to ask that question.

277
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,464
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Poughkeepsie!

278
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,051
Ross?

279
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,386
Ross?

280
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,013
Wake up!

281
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,686
Ross? Ross! Ross!

282
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,649
I need more swordfish.

283
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,404
-Can you get me more swordfish?
-I don't speak English.

284
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,531
You just did.

285
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,242
I don't know what to tell you.

286
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,953
Fine.

287
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,631
Very funny.

288
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,092
Let me out, please.

289
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,678
Come on, I'm cold!

290
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,891
And covered in marinara sauce!

291
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,476
Let me out!

292
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,983
You found that handle, did you?

293
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,904
-It's not funny.
-Well, that's not true.

294
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,410
I'm a good person.
And I'm a good chef.

295
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,748
And I don't deserve to have
marinara sauce all over me!

296
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,667
If you want me
to quit this bad then-

297
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,711
Hey. Chef Geller?

298
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,464
You know that speech you made?

299
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,924
I got a problem with it!

300
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,846
-You do?
-You bet I do!

301
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:03,434
I just, uh, wasn't listening then,
that's all.

302
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,981
If you want a problem,
I'll give you a problem!

303
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,151
What are you going to do?
Fire me?

304
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,905
You bet I'll fire you!
Get out of my kitchen!

305
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,366
Get out!

306
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:22,787
All right.

307
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,748
Anybody else got a problem?

308
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,000
How about you, chuckles?

309
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,960
You think this is funny now?

310
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,212
No.

311
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,842
What if I dance covered in sauce?
You think it's funny?

312
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,595
No, it's really good.

313
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,432
Take those salads to table four.

314
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,434
And you, get the swordfish!

315
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,186
And you!

316
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,188
Get a haircut!

317
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:56,946
Last stop, Montreal.
The stop is Montreal!

318
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,283
What?

319
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,999
I bet myself
that you had beautiful eyes.

320
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,711
Now that I see them, I win!

321
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:15,965
What?

322
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,428
We're at my stop.
Would you like to have coffee?

323
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,350
Are we really in Montreal?

324
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,977
Yes, we are.

325
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,687
So coffee?

326
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,441
Coffee sounds great.

327
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,361
Wait.

328
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,530
So you live in Montreal?

329
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,451
No, but it's only a two-hour
ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

330
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,498
I should have thought
about my wife and kids...

331
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,042
...before I talked back
to Chef Geller.

332
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,462
Thanks.

333
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,966
It will be a lean Christmas
at the Dragon house this year.

334
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,471
Enough!

335
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,391
Lean, lean, lean!

336
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,689
<i>Went to the store
Sat on Santa's lap</i>

337
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,942
<i>Asked him to bring my friends
All kinds of crap</i>

338
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,906
<i>Said all you need is
To write them a song</i>

339
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:26,076
<i>Now you haven't heard it yet
So don't try to sing along</i>

340
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,371
<i>No, don't sing along</i>

341
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,792
<i>Monica, Monica</i>

342
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,253
<i>Have a happy Hanukkah</i>

343
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,132
<i>Saw Santa Claus</i>

344
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,802
<i>He said hello to Ross</i>

345
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,890
<i>And please tell Joey</i>

346
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,393
<i>Christmas will be snowy</i>

347
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,898
<i>And Rachel and Chandler</i>

348
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,405
Happy holidays, everybody!
