1
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:04,713
So, now, what is this, now?

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,174
-Googlie Worm.
-Ha-ha-ha.

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,383
And this?

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,968
Glow Pop Jiggly Jam.

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,014
Bait is so funny.

6
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,017
Hey, um, what's this?

7
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,229
Oh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.

8
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:25,567
Oh, Geller's got one hooked.
Oh! Looks like a big one. Oh! Oh!

9
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,946
It's the classic struggle between man-

10
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,200
Someone knocked over a lamp.

11
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,121
Hey, you know what's gonna be great
about the fishing trip?

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,959
When my dad gives me that, "Joey,
what are you doing with your life?" stuff...

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,128
...I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie
with Charlton Heston, Dad.

14
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,256
-What are you doing with your life?"
-Aw.

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,763
You don't have to stop having fun
just because I'm here.

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,641
Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,519
Well, except you.

18
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,406
I don't think you should
leave Chandler alone.

19
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,992
It's only been two days
since he broke up with Kathy.

20
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,743
You can go fishing next week.

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,955
There's nothing I can do right now.
He's still in his sweatpants.

22
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,040
That's only phase one.

23
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,420
You know? I'll be back for phase two.
I would never miss phase two.

24
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,213
What's phase two?

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,507
Getting drunk and going to a strip club.

26
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,262
How does going to a strip club
make him better?

27
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,472
There are naked ladies there.

28
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,018
It helps him get to phase three,
picturing yourself with other women.

29
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:44,021
-There are naked ladies there too.
-Yeah.

30
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,483
Would you give me one minute, please?

31
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,496
So these will match the jacket
you picked out for me last week?

32
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,955
Mm-hm.

33
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,916
There we go.

34
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,503
There it is.

35
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,129
-Oh, you know what I need?
-Yeah?

36
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,758
-Gloves. Brown leather dress gloves.
-Oh, okay.

37
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,220
Uh, well, let's see. You're about a-
Well, this one is large. Ha, ha.

38
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,472
And, uh, this one....

39
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,891
-Also a large?
-Yeah. Okay.

40
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,477
-Yeah.
-Two larges coming right up. Ha, ha.

41
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,273
-Rachel, could I have a moment?
-Yes.

42
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,193
I was wondering, my niece, you see,
is in town from London.

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,654
-Uh-huh.
-Shropshire, really, but you know.

44
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,989
She's about your age, I'd say.

45
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,827
Anyway, I have tickets for the opera.
<i>Die Fledermaus.</i>

46
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,705
I was wondering if you would
keep her company this evening.

47
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,331
-Sure. You got it.
-Oh, good.

48
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,292
Count me in. Me, <i>Fledermaus. </i>Great.
I really....

49
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,214
Oh, yes, of course. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you so very much.

50
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,841
So?

51
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,261
So....

52
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,476
-Gloves?
-Oh, right. Sorry, I'll be right back.

53
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,979
Actually, you know what? I gotta take off.

54
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,107
But I was curious,
do you have any plans for tonight?

55
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,192
No, nothing.

56
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,195
I invested in this nightclub.
Would you like to come?

57
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,281
Yeah, that would be great.

58
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,366
You're into hard-core S and M, right?

59
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,288
-Well, I guess.
-I'm kidding.

60
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,832
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Whew.

61
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,335
I'm gonna put you on the VIP list, okay?
Look for me.

62
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,713
-Yeah. Great. You betcha.
-I'll see you tonight.

63
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,882
-Okay.
-Okay.

64
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,718
-I almost forgot the tickets, didn't I?
-What?

65
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,221
For you and Emily. Tonight.
<i>Die Fledermaus.</i>

66
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,516
Oh. Oh, right.

67
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,311
I think you'll like it.
It has two of the Three Tenors.

68
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,938
Okay.

69
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,906
I can't believe Kathy did this to me.
I really thought that she was the one.

70
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,450
Well, I'll tell you what.

71
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,119
From now on,
I am not getting out of this chair, ever.

72
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,456
Okay? From now on,
this chair is the one.

73
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,459
You know what else is the one?
My sweatpants.

74
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,463
Come on, man,
just take the sweats off, okay?

75
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,049
Just take them off
and we'll have some fun.

76
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,513
-Hey.
-Hi.

77
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,224
-Did you catch any big fish?
-Oh, my God, you guys have no idea.

78
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,975
-Oh, wow.
-Oh, my God, you stink.

79
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,435
Oh, are you kidding?

80
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,063
Three days on the lake without a shower.

81
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,274
Plus, I fell into that big tub of worms
at the bait stand.

82
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,528
Hey, how's he doing?

83
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,821
He hasn't gotten out of that chair
in two days.

84
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,406
Ahem. Hey, buddy, how's it going?

85
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,291
You see that?
He just needed his pal to come home.

86
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,918
I gotta go memorize my lines.

87
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,671
Me and Charlton Heston,
bright and early tomorrow, baby.

88
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,464
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

89
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,800
-Hey.
-Hey.

90
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,718
-Hey.
-Hey, Monica.

91
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,222
-Uh-oh. What's the matter?
-Oh....

92
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,560
Joshua invited me
to this fancy club opening tonight.

93
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,604
But I already told Mr. Waltham...

94
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,109
...that I would take his niece
to the dumb old opera.

95
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,736
So, what are you gonna do?

96
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,407
-I don't know, sweetie.
-No. Help me.

97
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,660
-I can't. I have to work.
-Phoebe?

98
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,246
I would, but I get my morning sickness
in the evening.

99
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,584
Ooh, no, unless she wants to spend
the night holding my hair back for me.

100
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,629
Ugh. Gosh, you guys, come on. This is-
I have to meet Joshua.

101
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,424
This is my one chance
for him to see the fun Rachel.

102
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:26,720
You know, the "Wouldn't it be great
if she were my wife?" Rachel.

103
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,557
Are Joey and Chandler back?

104
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,893
Oh, Chandler's still in phase one,
and Joey's that thing you smell.

105
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,312
Oh.

106
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,942
Hi.

107
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,112
Hi.

108
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,782
So...?

109
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,202
No.

110
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,538
Oh, come on.

111
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,835
-I think she's here.
-No, wait, wait, wait. Ross, please?

112
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,339
You want me to take some girl
I've never met to the opera...

113
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,717
...so you can go to a club
and flirt with some guy?

114
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,262
Hmm. Yeah, that is a toughie.

115
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,473
Oh, she's looking down the hall.

116
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,601
She looked right at me.

117
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,480
Oh, wait, you can't see people
through that little hole, can you?

118
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,691
Hello.

119
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,693
-Hello?
-Aah!

120
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,447
Oh, I'll be right there.
Okay, Ross, please. Come on.

121
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,032
I thought we had moved on.

122
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,535
I thought we'd gotten to a place
where we could be happy for each other.

123
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,954
I mean, was that just me?

124
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:39,751
-All right, I'll do it.
-Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

125
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,170
-Emily?
-Yes.

126
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,298
-I'm Rachel Green.
-Thank goodness.

127
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,803
There has been a teeny change of plans.
It turns out I'm not free tonight, so-

128
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,055
Really? Hen.

129
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:56,559
That's lovely. I must have missed your call,
even though I didn't leave the flat all day.

130
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,978
-Well, no, I-
-No, no, no, that's not rude.

131
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,563
It's in keeping with a trip...

132
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,693
...where I've already been run down
by one of your wiener carts...

133
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,529
...and been strip-searched
at John F. Kennedy Airport.

134
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,280
Apparently, I look like someone...

135
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,784
...who's got a balloon full of cocaine
stuffed up their bum.

136
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,039
I think you look great.

137
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,584
Good night.
It was very nice to meet you all.

138
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,589
I'll get her.

139
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,426
-Please hurry.
-Okay.

140
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,721
Don't you just love the way they talk?

141
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,389
"Ooh. Oh."

142
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,273
Oh!

143
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,442
-What?
-It kicked. I think the baby kicked.

144
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,901
-Oh, my God.
-Ha, ha.

145
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,822
Oh, no, wait. Oh. That was the elastic
in my underwear busted.

146
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,659
Oh, my God. I overslept.

147
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,329
I was supposed to be on the set
a half an hour ago. I gotta get out of here.

148
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,832
What? Joey, you can't go like that.
You stink.

149
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,752
I fell asleep before I could shower.
Now I don't have time.

150
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,421
They're 10 blocks away.
If I run, I can make it.

151
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,923
Yeah, run 10 blocks.
That'll help the smell.

152
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,635
Hey. Whoa! Slow down.
No, keep moving. Whoa.

153
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,973
-So how did it go with Joshua last night?
-Oh. Well, I didn't see Joshua.

154
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,059
But I did punch a girl in the face.

155
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,269
-What?
-Why?

156
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,855
The whole night was horrible.
It was pouring rain.

157
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:28,985
And there was no Rachel Green on the list,
but there was a Rachel Greep.

158
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,945
Oh. So did you get to meet her?

159
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,660
No, there is no Rachel Greep.
But then this other girl overheard us.

160
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,372
And she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep,
I'm Rachel Greep," and he let her in.

161
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,000
-So you hit her in the face?
-No, she was already in.

162
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,504
But then this big bitch behind me
tried to steal my umbrella...

163
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,755
...so I clocked her.

164
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,092
Ugh. I can't believe this.

165
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,679
All I wanted was just a few hours
outside of work to see Joshua...

166
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,350
...so that he could go ahead
and start falling in love with me.

167
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,188
Aw. Pheebs.

168
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:07,982
Honey, that's your name.

169
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,571
That's short for Phoebe?
I thought that's what we called each other.

170
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,410
-Hey, you're wearing pants.
-That's right.

171
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,455
Where are the guys?
I'm ready to get drunk and see strippers.

172
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,335
-It's 9:30 in the morning.
-They got a breakfast buffet.

173
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,549
-Hello? Oh, hey, Ross.
-Ooh. Let me talk to him.

174
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,758
Oh, my God.

175
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,260
-Can't I just-?
-Shh. Wait, what?

176
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,762
-It's my phone and she's shush-
-Shh. Please.

177
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,347
What's he saying?

178
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,100
He's with Emily at a bed and breakfast
in Vermont.

179
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,185
What? Oh, my God.

180
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,730
Who the hell is Emily? No.

181
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,235
They're in Vermont?
How did this happen?

182
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,820
Ow.

183
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,365
How did he end up in Vermont
with that awful witch?

184
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,909
Maybe she doesn't hit him all the time.

185
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,745
<i>When we met her...</i>

186
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,914
...she was soaking, her feet were wet.

187
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,666
Who wouldn't be miserable?

188
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:11,129
Once I got her into a dry pair of shoes,
she was a totally different person.

189
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,924
Ross, come quickly. There's a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard.

190
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,928
I gotta go! There's a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard!

191
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:25,310
He had to go. There was a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard.

192
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,105
I don't get this. She was horrible.

193
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,316
Okay, I'm gonna go stand over there.

194
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,696
-Why do you care so much, anyway?
-I don't care.

195
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,743
You know what? I'm just upset
that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.

196
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,164
Know what? Still, you do not just meet
someone and go flitting off to Vermont.

197
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,375
Well, when you first met Barry,
you flitted off to Vail.

198
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:54,505
Ugh. You know, could you just for once
not remember every little thing?

199
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,969
So, you know, when's he getting back?

200
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,638
-A couple of days.
-Know what?

201
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,973
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

202
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,226
What are you doing?

203
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,646
Chandler. You can't just go back a phase.

204
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,274
Yes, you can. You're thinking about time.
You can't go back in time.

205
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:19,697
Why don't you just-? Why don't you do
your phase-two strip-club thing with us?

206
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,159
-Yeah, come on, we can be guys.
-Heh. No, you can't.

207
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,996
Come on, let us be guys.
Maybe we wanna be guys.

208
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,289
You don't wanna be guys.

209
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,209
You'd be all hairy
and you wouldn't live as long.

210
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,669
You know, you....

211
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,589
Would you just stop being such a wuss
and get those off?

212
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,717
And you come with us
and watch naked girls dance around.

213
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,012
Okay.

214
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,182
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,022
Hey, Joey Tribbiani. I'm here, I'm here.

216
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,191
Calm down, we got time.
We're running a little late.

217
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,401
Oh.

218
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,071
All set.

219
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,036
Look at that.
Charlton Heston eating a licorice whip.

220
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,248
Yeah, he loves them.
I've never seen him with-

221
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:18,715
Whoa. Yeah. What the hell is that?
What smells so bad?

222
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,842
-You.
-Oh.

223
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:25,888
I could see why you would think that.
But actually, you know who I think it is?

224
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,892
-You?
-No, no. It's Heston.

225
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,564
-What?
-The man reeks.

226
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,984
Smells like he went on a three-day
fishing trip and then ate licorice. Ick.

227
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,861
There's no way he smells.

228
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,156
He's the only one around here
with a shower in his dressing room.

229
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:47,327
Really? A shower, huh?
And, uh, which room might that be?

230
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,747
The one with "Heston" on it.

231
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,833
Interesting.

232
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,843
<i>Gonna take my time</i>

233
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:10,350
Hey. I got some ones.
You wanna put them in her panties?

234
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,935
No, thanks, Mom.

235
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,690
Oh. No. Urn, hi. That, that.

236
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,610
You have to put that out
because I'm pregnant, so....

237
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:24,530
Well, maybe you and your baby
ought to go to another strip club.

238
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,742
Heh, hen. It's not my baby. Heh, heh.

239
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,456
Very good. Yes. That was so good.

240
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:38,044
Really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.

241
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,964
Well, I just checked our messages,
and Joshua didn't call.

242
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,551
I mean, you would think he'd be worried
about me not showing up.

243
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:50,515
Ugh. And you know what makes it worse?
Ross is all happy in Vermont.

244
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,643
Come on, look where you are.

245
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,940
-Another round of daiquiris.
-Remember, virgin for me, please.

246
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:02,401
Oh, and don't let me leave
without getting the name of that carpet guy.

247
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,195
Oh, come on.

248
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,490
You know what?
I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.

249
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,827
-Well, if you think it'll help.
-No. That was a test.

250
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,955
In a couple hours, I'm gonna get drunk
and wanna call Kathy...

251
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,373
...and you have to stop me.

252
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,417
Then I'm gonna be so drunk,
I'm gonna wanna call Janice.

253
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,336
-You should. How is she?
-Oh!

254
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,715
I think somebody
needs another lap dance.

255
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,986
Hello? Who's in there?

256
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,617
How you doing?

257
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,579
Who in the hell are you?

258
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,249
Uh, guess you wouldn't believe me
if I said I was Kirk Douglas, huh?

259
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,212
Put some pants on, kid,
so I can kick your butt.

260
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,299
No, no, no, wait. You don't understand.

261
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,302
See, I'm an actor.

262
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,389
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm doing a scene with you today.

263
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,765
And, well, I stink.

264
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,977
-You're in this picture?
-Yeah, yeah.

265
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,772
I'm one of the cops who won't work
with you because you're a loose cannon.

266
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,901
Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I just—
I stink.

267
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,405
-Joey, right?
-Yeah.

268
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,037
Every actor, one time or another- Ah.

269
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,541
Every actor thinks he stinks.

270
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,253
Even Laurence Olivier
sometimes thought he stank.

271
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,216
-Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
-No, no, no, you don't understand.

272
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,760
-Listen to me.
-No- Yeah.

273
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,554
I don't know one actor worth his salt...

274
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:58,351
...who one time in his career didn't say,
"God, I stink."

275
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:03,105
Hell, I just did a scene out there.
First take, I stunk the place up.

276
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:08,694
But the important thing
that you must remember...

277
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,822
...no matter how badly
you think you stink...

278
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:17,620
...you must never, ever bust into
my dressing room and use my shower.

279
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,789
Do you understand me?

280
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,000
-Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
-Wait a minute.

281
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,962
-Take your pants.
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

282
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,301
-So we did okay at the strip club, right?
-Oh, yeah. That was great.

283
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,054
Thanks to you,
the hottest waitress there is quitting...

284
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,223
...to teach the third grade.

285
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,101
I can't believe it. He still hasn't called.

286
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,478
-Who, Josh?
-It's "Joshua."

287
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,147
-What, he doesn't like "Josh"?
-No, I don't.

288
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,818
All right.
Well, I'm gonna put my sweats back on.

289
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,987
No, wait. You know what?
You were right.

290
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,073
We really weren't great at being guys.
But do you know why?

291
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,617
Because we're girls.

292
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,787
-Yeah.
-Do you know what girls are good at?

293
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,205
Stripping.

294
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,335
No, listening. Sit.

295
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:11,340
You know, maybe it would really,
really help if you would just talk.

296
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,510
Yeah, come on.
What's going on in there?

297
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,179
Yeah.

298
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,850
And you know, if you wanna cry,
that's okay too.

299
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,520
Okay, look,
I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.

300
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,105
Come on, Chandler.

301
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:30,526
Look, forget it.
We tried, but phase three is a lost cause.

302
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,361
Those strippers were insanely hot...

303
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,406
...and I couldn't picture myself
with any of them.

304
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,620
-They really were pretty, weren't they?
-Oh.

305
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,332
-I really liked that fighter pilot one.
-Oh, Candy?

306
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,127
-Oh, she was so spunky.
-Yeah.

307
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,255
You know,
I think if I were gonna be with a woman...

308
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,593
...it'd be with someone like Michelle.

309
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,804
She was- Oh, she was just so petite.

310
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,515
See, I don't know.
For me, it would have to be Chantal.

311
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,017
-Oh, Chantal, yeah.
-Chantal.

312
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,561
You know? Oh, my God. The- Oh.

313
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,188
She had the smoothest skin.

314
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:11,692
I mean, when I stuck that dollar bill
in her G-string and grazed her thigh-

315
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,819
Phase three!

316
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,738
I just achieved phase three!

317
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,073
Really?

318
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,742
I am totally picturing you
with all those women.

319
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:25,289
-That's not phase three.
-Well, I'm there too.

320
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,795
-Well, are we all together in a group?
-Stop it, you're killing me.

321
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,880
I think I just moved on to phase four.

322
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,925
-Oh, what is that?
-Where I don't want a relationship ever.

323
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,595
I just wanna have sex with strippers
and my friends.

324
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,894
Come on. Let me see that smile.

325
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,229
I don't wanna.

326
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,022
Please?

327
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,109
I wanted to go to the strip club.

328
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,778
You're gonna have plenty of chances,
okay?

329
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,949
There are thousands of women out there
who are just waiting to screw me over.

330
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,119
Yeah, all right.

331
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,121
-Hey.
-Hey.

332
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,581
Hey. Ooh, how was Vermont?

333
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,709
Emily is incredible.

334
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,337
I mean,
there are no words to describe her.

335
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:17,425
The whole weekend was like a dream.

336
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,011
-Oh. And you. Rach. Hey.
-Oh, hey.

337
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,682
-You were so right.
-What?

338
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,643
What you said about us
finally being in a place...

339
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,770
...where we could really be happy
for each other.

340
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,189
-Hmm.
-I mean, I....

341
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,776
-I admit, I wasn't quite there.
-Mm-hm.

342
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,071
You know, I mean,
the thought of you and that Josh guy-

343
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,075
-"Joshua."
-Joshua guy at that club...

344
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,411
...dancing, having a good time.

345
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,329
And the thought of it kind of....

346
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,540
-You know?
-Yeah.

347
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:53,461
But now, but now, I'm totally there.

348
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm finally where you are.

349
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,798
Oh, thank goodness.

350
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,010
Yeah, and thank you for Emily.

351
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:04,847
Oh, no problem.
I'm so glad I could help, you know?

352
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,891
I'm happy for you.

353
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,184
Happy for you.

354
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,687
Oh, no, happy for you.

355
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,611
All right, ladies,
here's what we're gonna do.

356
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,280
You are gonna take off my clothes.

357
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,616
You two go get the oils.

358
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,118
And you constantly scream
at the top of your voice:

359
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,662
"Chandler's the king!
Chandler's the king!"

360
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,248
No, I wanna be with her. I like her.

361
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,543
Oh, that's fine. Go with your instincts.
Go with your instincts.

362
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,045
Wait, what am I doing again?

363
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,089
Would you please pay attention?
I could wake up at any moment.

364
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,759
Hi, I'm Joshua.
I'm here to pick up Rachel.

365
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,761
No, no, no, that's not Joshua.

366
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,056
What do you want from me?
I never met the guy.

367
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:53,354
So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay.
The rest of us have a lot of work to do.

368
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,692
What are you doing?

369
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,737
All right, listen, I gotta wake up.
