1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,545
<i>Previously </i>on Friends:

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,797
-I can't believe you won't be there.
-I know.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,799
Why can't you take a couple of days off?

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,219
-Because I can't.
-This is my wedding.

5
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:14,056
-I can't wait to see it.
-Her parents got married there.

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,100
It's the most beautiful place.
It's right over-

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,061
Oh, my God!

8
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,980
The only thing I understand is
postponing is not an option.

9
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,690
This wedding is not gonna happen.

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:29,696
If you don't love this, then we'll do it
any other place or time. It's fine.

11
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,532
It's perfect.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,325
-I'm going to London.
-What?

13
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,786
It's not over until someone says, "I do."

14
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,955
I do! I do! I do!

15
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,623
Rachel, no!

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,713
The Waltham residence.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,382
Hi, is this Emily's parents' house?

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,634
<i>This is the housekeeper.</i>

19
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:55,681
And, by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

20
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,642
<i>First one identifies oneself...</i>

21
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,021
...and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,440
Um, this is Phoebe Buffay.

23
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,442
I was wondering, please...

24
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,695
...if it's not too much trouble, please...

25
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:13,282
...um, might I speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

26
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,785
Miss Waltham is
at the rehearsal dinner.

27
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:20,581
And it is not polite
to make fun of people. Goodbye.

28
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,916
No, no! I'll be nice, I swear.

29
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,127
Could you just give me their number?

30
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,839
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

31
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:33,719
Somebody is on their way to ruin the wedding,
and I have to warn them.

32
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,638
So give me that number
or I'll come over there...

33
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:41,393
...and I'll kick your snooty ass
all the way to New Gloukenshire!

34
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,146
Hello? Hello? Oh!

35
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,441
Ooh, she knew I could kick her ass.

36
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,410
Hi, sweetheart.

37
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,038
Mom, Dad.

38
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,623
Oh, sorry, we're late.

39
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,000
My fault. I insisted on riding the tube.

40
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,294
Judy, the kids!

41
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,547
That's what they call the subway.

42
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,757
Oh!

43
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:54,966
I thought-

44
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,302
Dad, we got it.

45
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,055
Oh! Here comes my dad and stepmom.

46
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,431
Mr. and Mrs. Geller.

47
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,517
This is Steven...

48
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,227
...and Andrea Waltham.

49
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,354
How do you do? Very nice to meet you.

50
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,398
-Ha, ha!
-Eh, darling, the Gellers.

51
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,316
Darling, it's the Gellers.

52
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,153
She's self-involved.
I should never have married her.

53
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,031
-Sorry, what?
-It's the Gellers.

54
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,992
-Where?
-That's one and that's another one.

55
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,787
Lovely to meet you.

56
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,248
Nice of you to pay
for half the wedding.

57
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,959
Oh, the hell with tradition!
We're happy to do it.

58
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,962
Oh, we know how expensive
weddings can be.

59
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,173
Besides, this may be
the only wedding we get to throw.

60
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:36,758
Ahem, ha, ha.

61
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,094
A joke that's funny in all countries.

62
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,015
Sir?

63
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:48,019
-What's in it?
-Goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.

64
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,233
That's not food.

65
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,193
No, I don't want it.

66
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,073
Everything's different here.
I want to go home.

67
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,702
I miss my family, the coffeehouse.

68
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,246
I can't remember
what Phoebe looks like!

69
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,915
Joey, it's been three days.

70
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,459
Oh.

71
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,544
Okay, you're just a little homesick.

72
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,256
Would you just try to relax
and just enjoy yourself?

73
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,967
You're different here too.

74
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,345
You're mean in England!

75
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,973
What the hell?

76
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,183
What's up, Dad?

77
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,144
This bill for my half. It's insane.

78
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,897
Why is it so much?
The reception's at their house.

79
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:36,109
Flowers, liquor. Re-carpet first floor?

80
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,029
New guest bath, landscaping.

81
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,448
I'm paying to remodel this house.

82
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,534
I'll give that son of a bitch
a piece of my mind.

83
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,244
Dad. Please.

84
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,080
I don't want anything to upset Emily.

85
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,292
She's had a hard enough
couple of days as it is.

86
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,669
Here. Let me go talk to him.

87
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,130
You tell him no one takes advantage
of the Gellers.

88
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,841
Ooh, Jack.

89
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,095
Sometimes I forget
how powerful you can be.

90
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,143
And I'll go get drunk.

91
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,066
Oh! Oh! Oh!

92
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,151
-Hi.
-Hello.

93
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,486
Hello.

94
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,696
Um, when is your next flight to London?

95
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,241
-There's one leaving in 30 minutes.
-Oh!

96
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,910
And I do have one seat left.

97
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,620
Oh, thank you, thank you.

98
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:32,832
The last-minute fare
on this ticket is $2700.

99
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,836
Ugh. I don't have enough left
on my credit card.

100
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,506
You can split it with another card.

101
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,591
Okay, how about five?

102
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,761
Oh, thank you.

103
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,389
I need to see your passport.

104
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:54,646
I don't have it, but I can tell you
where it is on my nightstand.

105
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,734
You know what?
I have my driver's license.

106
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:04,030
And I have a 20.

107
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,580
Face it, my father is not gonna pay
for the built-in barbecue.

108
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,958
And believe me, you can
kiss your gazebo goodbye.

109
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,671
I might be able
to get you the new lawn.

110
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,632
Ah! Then you have to give us
the lawn ornaments.

111
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:27,429
I go back there with lawn ornaments,
he'll laugh in my face.

112
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,600
Will you say something, Steven?

113
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,937
Don't take that tone with me.

114
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,274
All right, you can.

115
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,071
-Hi, Pheebs.
-Oh, thank God!

116
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,574
Oh, you changed your mind. Ugh!

117
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,452
You probably don't want
to talk about it.

118
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,621
You're doing the right thing.

119
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,165
-Bye, Pheebs.
-Where are you going?

120
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,791
What are you doing? No, wait.

121
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:01,296
Why am I always pregnant
when she does that?

122
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,717
I'd like to toast Ross and Emily.

123
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,844
My big toast is tomorrow.

124
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:12,182
This is kind of my little toast,
or Melba toast, if you will.

125
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,436
Okay.

126
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:21,566
Ahem. I knew Ross when he was, uh,
going out with his first girlfriend.

127
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,776
Oh, heh.

128
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,362
I thought things would work out
until he over-inflated her.

129
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,619
Oh, dear God!

130
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,707
Hello, Waltham Interiors.

131
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,376
Oh! Hi, Mrs. Waltham.

132
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,338
I need to speak with, um,
one of the best men or Ross' sister.

133
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:48,134
-Who is this?
-Oh, Phoebe, one of Ross' best friends.

134
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,595
If you're Ross' friend,
why aren't you here?

135
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,724
Um, I can't fly.
I'm having my brother's babies.

136
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,646
Oh.

137
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,940
Am I on the radio?

138
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,150
No. Um...

139
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,945
...can I talk to one of them?
It's important.

140
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,240
I'm bored of you now.
I'm going to cut you off.

141
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,741
Oh!

142
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:16,955
We're excited that, uh, Ross and Emily
are getting married at Montgomery Hall.

143
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,999
To think, my friend getting
married in Monty Hall.

144
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,335
Oh, come on, Monty Hall!

145
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,463
<i>Let's Make a Deal.
</i>Come on, you people!

146
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,342
All right, forget it.
Congratulations, Ross and Emily.

147
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:37,100
Hey. Best man number two,
Joey Tribbiani. Ha, ha.

148
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,519
I'm not good with the jokes
like Chandler here.

149
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,690
But, uh...

150
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,609
...congratulations to the happy couple.

151
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:51,197
I first met Ross
in this coffeehouse back home.

152
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,497
Home.

153
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,250
New York City.

154
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,753
Where everybody knows my name.

155
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,590
Uh, anyway...

156
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,092
...uh, I love you guys.

157
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,387
But not as much as I love America.

158
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,225
Can we please go home now?

159
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,020
Are you going home?

160
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,773
I was hoping to get
to know you better.

161
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,651
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.

162
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,948
I was laughing.

163
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,618
Out loud?

164
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,747
I didn't want everyone
to think I was stupid.

165
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,624
So how are you doing?

166
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,418
My mom's driving me crazy.
But Ross is getting married!

167
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,337
I'm happy. I won't let anything spoil that.

168
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,756
Mm-hm.

169
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,843
I just want to say that
Ross is a wonderful young man.

170
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,138
Oh, thanks. We like him. Ha, ha.

171
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:01,226
My God! You must have been
a teenager when you had him.

172
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,774
There's no way in hell I'm paying for it.

173
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,527
Look, we're down to just one point.

174
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,988
Could we please just settle it
after the wedding?

175
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,534
Fine, but I'm not paying
for your wine cellar...

176
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,163
...you thieving, would-be-speaking-
German-if-it-weren't-for-us man!

177
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:31,047
The guy was hammered.
There's no way you look like Ross' mother.

178
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,093
-Then why would he say it?
-Because he's crazy!

179
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,597
Earlier, he thanked me for my very
moving performance in <i>Titanic.</i>

180
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,436
My mother's right. I'll never get married.

181
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,022
Ha! You know what, that is—

182
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,358
Who wouldn't want you?

183
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,862
Please! I'm a single mom
with a 30-year-old son.

184
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,869
I'm getting married today!

185
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,120
Whoo! Heh.

186
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,872
Morning.

187
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,124
I'm getting married today!

188
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,960
-Yeah, you are.
-Woo-hoo!

189
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,422
Do you think he knew I was here?

190
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,058
I've never done that with you before. Heh.

191
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,935
Nope. Ha, ha.

192
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,188
So, uh, how are you?

193
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,981
You okay?

194
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,524
Yeah, yeah.

195
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,109
-You?
-Oh, yes, yes.

196
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,861
Uh-huh.

197
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,154
You?

198
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,240
We did you.

199
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,492
Hmm.

200
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,369
Well....

201
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,373
-I better get going.
-Oh, absolutely. Ha, ha.

202
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,377
Could you not look?

203
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,421
I don't want to look.

204
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,441
-Uh, uh, excuse me.
-Yeah.

205
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,902
If you're planning on doing that
the entire flight...

206
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,155
...please tell me now
so that I can take a sedative.

207
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,407
Or maybe slip you one.

208
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,286
It's just, I'm, uh, kind of excited.

209
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,791
I'm, um, going to London
to, uh, tell this guy that I love him.

210
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,390
-Hello.
-Where the hell have you been?

211
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,599
Hey.

212
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,354
I spent the night out.
I met this cute bridesmaid. She is-

213
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,814
I don't want to hear it!

214
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,442
Aw, Pheebs, you know you're still
my number one girl.

215
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,239
We have an emergency.
Rachel's coming to London.

216
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,157
Oh, great!

217
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,537
No, she's coming to tell Ross
that she loves him.

218
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,830
But he loves Emily.

219
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,707
I know that!

220
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,210
You have to stop her.
She's going to ruin the wedding.

221
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,379
Okay.

222
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,506
I've done my part, okay?

223
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,010
It's your responsibility now.
The burden is off me.

224
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,386
Right.

225
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,888
So tell me about this girl.

226
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,144
Hey. Have you seen Monica?

227
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,895
I'm not seeing Monica.

228
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,609
-What?
-What?

229
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,902
Look, we gotta find her.

230
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,864
Phoebe called. Rachel's coming
to tell Ross she loves him.

231
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,074
-Oh, my God.
-I know. We gotta find Monica.

232
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,659
-Know where she is?
-No, okay?

233
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,371
What's with the third degree?
Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?

234
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,335
Then I realized all this stuff
I had been doing...

235
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,590
...proposing to Joshua,
lying about why I couldn't come...

236
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,551
-...was all just a way of—
-Oh! Oh! Oh!

237
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,054
I'm sorry. Can I interrupt?

238
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,642
I just want to say that you are
a horrible, horrible person.

239
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,228
Pardon me?

240
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,982
You're about to ruin
the happiest day of his life.

241
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,443
I have to agree
with your friend Pheebs.

242
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,030
This is a terrible, terrible plan.

243
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,658
-But he has to know how I feel.
-But why?

244
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,870
He loves this Emily.
No good can come of this.

245
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,831
Ugh! I think you're wrong.

246
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, no!

247
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,048
By the way, it seems to be clear
you were on a break.

248
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,894
Oh, my God!

249
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,522
It's like a fairyland.

250
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,857
I know. It's horrible, isn't it?

251
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,194
I love it. I only hope
my wedding looks this good.

252
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,197
-Ha! I just hope-
-You can let some go by.

253
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,909
Psst. Monica.

254
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,036
Start looking out for Rachel.

255
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,248
I'll cover the door.
You watch that big hole.

256
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,416
I've got Chandler covering Ross.

257
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,253
Why would I care where Chandler is? Heh.

258
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,839
You know, uh...

259
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,092
...sometimes I don't even like Chandler.

260
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,553
-Okay.
-Heh.

261
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,181
I do.

262
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,892
I do.

263
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,561
I do.

264
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,937
Oh, it's the second one.

265
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,397
Right?

266
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,485
Hello, Joey.

267
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,821
Hey, Felicity.

268
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:50,032
Um, I thought about you all day.

269
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,576
-Yeah?
-Ha, ha.

270
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,369
Talk New York to me again.

271
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,373
-Forget about it.
-Heh.

272
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,666
How you doing?

273
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,126
-Mm!
-Ha-ha-ha.

274
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,090
We're not paying
for your wine cellar.

275
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,342
You have to meet me in the middle.

276
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,387
My foot will meet
the middle of your ass.

277
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,476
-What's going on?
-Oh, everything's under control.

278
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,146
You want a piece of me?
Is that what you're saying?

279
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,440
That's it!

280
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,901
Parents! Parents! Back away!

281
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,861
This is our wedding day!

282
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,405
From now on, everyone gets along.

283
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,866
And if I hear one more word...

284
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,242
...no grandchildren!

285
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,535
That's right!

286
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,745
Okay, okay.

287
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,079
Sorry, old boy.

288
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,165
Sorry. Sorry.

289
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,294
I could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

290
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,216
What was that about?

291
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,344
It was this disagreement over-

292
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,306
My God! You look beautiful.

293
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,517
Oh!

294
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,020
Oh! You can't see me
before the wedding. It's bad luck.

295
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,941
I think we've had all the bad luck
we're going to have.

296
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,229
My God, hen, Rachel!

297
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,817
You're here. I can't believe it.

298
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,819
-Ha.
-Uh....

299
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,280
Why are you here?

300
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,615
I just came to-

301
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,080
I just needed to tell you...

302
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,127
...congratulations.

303
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,035
Waltham Interiors.

304
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,620
<i>Mrs. Waltham? It's Phoebe.</i>

305
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:46,250
Can I talk to one of the best men?
This is going to be the last time.

306
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,503
There's a girl on the phone for you.

307
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,881
Oh, great!

308
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,008
Hello?

309
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,509
<i>It's Phoebe.</i>

310
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,553
Did you stop Rachel?

311
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,764
But she just hugged him. That's it.

312
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,183
-Nothing got ruined?
<i>-No.</i>

313
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,934
Oh, that's so great!

314
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,812
Oh! So, what's going on now?

315
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,439
Uh...

316
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,858
...I'm walking down the aisle.

317
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,779
Still walking.

318
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,783
Now I'm at the front with Ross.

319
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,326
It's Phoebe!

320
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,499
He looks pretty mad.

321
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,751
Uh, I better go.

322
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,420
Wait! Hold it up so I can listen.

323
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:42,306
-What we did last night was-
-Stupid. Hmm.

324
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,767
-Totally crazy, stupid.
-Ha, ha.

325
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,395
What were we thinking? Heh.

326
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,356
I'm coming over tonight though, right?

327
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,609
Oh, yeah, definitely.

328
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,262
Friends, family...

329
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,556
...we are gathered to celebrate...

330
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,767
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.

331
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,937
<i>May the happiness of today...</i>

332
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,439
...be with them always.

333
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,816
Now, Emily, repeat after me.

334
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,485
-I, Emily.
-I, Emily.

335
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,946
-Take thee, Ross.
-Take thee, Ross.

336
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:42,116
As my lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

337
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,410
...till death parts us.

338
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:48,581
As my lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

339
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,791
...until death parts us.

340
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,501
Now, Ross.

341
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,671
Repeat after me.

342
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,506
I, Ross.

343
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,841
I, Ross.

344
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,509
Take thee, Emily.

345
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,428
Take thee, Rachel-

346
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,975
Emily!

347
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,774
Ha. Emily.

348
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,697
Uh....

349
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,575
Shall I go on?
