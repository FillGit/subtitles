1
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:08,425
Okay, she is the star of the play,
and she is my girlfriend.

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,303
I get to have sex
with the star of the play.

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,223
-People can hear you.
-I know.

4
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,358
-Wow, she looks great, doesn't she?
-Mm.

5
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,153
-Hi.
-Hi.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,822
That is one good-looking man.

7
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:37,579
Is it just me, or can you actually
see his abs through his overcoat?

8
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,416
So, you been doing this long?

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,921
No. You're my first.
Put the money on the table.

10
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,800
Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,134
Ooh, that's nice.

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,847
Dude.

13
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,854
-Is that an expensive blouse?
-If you want it to be.

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,237
Here's your girlfriend's button.

15
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:06,376
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have, like, your
old blouses and dresses from high school?

16
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,546
Yeah, I think I have some
around here somewhere. Why?

17
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,882
Well, it's just maternity clothes
are so expensive.

18
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,637
Hey, Rach, I made a pile
of your stuff on this side of your room.

19
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,473
-If you could just-
-Ugh!

20
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,517
-throw your purses at it.

21
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,395
Bloomingdale's eliminated
my department.

22
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,317
-Oh, my God. Are you out of a job?
-No, they stuck me in Personal Shopping...

23
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,694
...which is just a huge step down.

24
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,154
Personal Shopping, what is that?

25
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,573
Like where you walk around
with snooty rich people...

26
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,408
...and tell them what to buy?

27
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,870
-Uh-huh.
-That sounds great.

28
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,539
Hey.

29
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,126
Um, excuse me, we switched apartments.

30
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,046
You can't eat our food anymore.
That gravy train has ended.

31
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,923
There's gravy?

32
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,469
If you have the big apartment, then deal
with people coming over all the time.

33
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,722
That fridge has got to be stocked, okay?
That's your apartment now.

34
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:08,063
-What are you doing?
-I think I left a doughnut up here.

35
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,735
-Hey.
-Hey.

36
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,737
Oh, how was Kathy's play?

37
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,032
Well, Kathy gets half-naked
and simulates sex...

38
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,910
...with a real good-looking guy.

39
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,955
Yeah, it was like somebody
wrote down my worst nightmare...

40
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,041
...and then charged me $32 to see it.

41
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,294
That's a good idea for a business.

42
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,465
I'm totally screwed, okay? They're gonna be
hot and heavy on-stage every night...

43
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,469
...and then they're gonna go to their
cast parties, and he's gonna undermine me.

44
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:43,140
You know, he'll be like, "So where's your
boyfriend? What's his name, Chester?"

45
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:47,727
And she'll go, "No, no, no. It's Chandler."
He'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha."

46
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,022
That is a good trick.

47
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,652
All right, look, look.
What am I gonna do?

48
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,822
Chandler, look, they're actors.
They're there to do a job.

49
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,616
Just because they work together
doesn't mean they'll get together.

50
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,494
Just because it happened
with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins...

51
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,580
...doesn't mean it's gonna happen
with them.

52
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,916
Oh, oh. Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

53
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,127
-Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
-Yeah.

54
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,755
Okay, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.

55
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,301
They're not a couple.

56
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,261
Oh, okay, I get the game now.

57
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,182
Okay, look, look.
Let me ask you a question.

58
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,684
When they were doing it on-stage,
was it like really hot?

59
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,811
Huh. Oh, yeah.

60
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,315
Well, okay, so then you're fine.

61
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:37,778
Look, the rule is when two actors
are actually doing it off-stage...

62
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,281
...then all the sexual tension
between them is gone.

63
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:45,702
Okay? So as long as it's hot on-stage,
you got nothing to worry about.

64
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,538
It's when the heat goes away,
that's when you're in trouble.

65
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,999
Really?

66
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,959
You guys have been to every play
I've been in.

67
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,753
Have I ever had chemistry on-stage?

68
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,546
-No.
-No.

69
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,553
So, uh, man, are you gonna go see the play
with me tonight?

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,972
You know what? I don't know
how comfortable I am...

71
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,559
...going to see how hot the sex is
between some guy and your girlfriend.

72
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,270
-Yeah, I know-
-No, no, no, oh, I'm there.

73
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,815
-Hey.
-Hey, Mon.

74
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,151
-Want some pancakes?
-You made pancakes?

75
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,111
Yep. Grab a plate.

76
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,782
No, no. Stay right there.

77
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,786
Getting closer.

78
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,622
Don't worry...

79
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,750
...we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles...

80
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:38,380
...and jams, jellies and marmalades,
which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.

81
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,676
Also we're watching the game here
Saturday, if people want to come over.

82
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:43,927
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh.

83
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,137
I was having people over for the game.

84
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,306
Oh, yeah? Who's playing?

85
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,018
The players.

86
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,940
Somebody seems to be missing
being the hostess.

87
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:02,445
Ha, ha. Please, it's a relief,
is what it is, is what it is.

88
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,865
All right. Pheebs, stick out your plate.

89
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,116
Oh.

90
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,249
Monica, I'm quitting.

91
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:18,712
I just helped an 81-year-old woman put on
a thong, and she didn't even buy it.

92
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,674
I'm telling you, I'm quitting, that's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.

93
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,927
Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

94
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,346
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this message.

95
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,475
Oh! Mr. Waltham?
I, uh, really need to talk to you.

96
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,186
In a moment, please.
I'm in the middle of a task.

97
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,688
And you have a customer.

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,319
-Hi.
-Hi. I'm Joshua.

99
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,780
Hi, I'm Rachel Green.
What can I do for you, Joshua?

100
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:50,952
Well, I need a new wardrobe. My wife-
Well, my ex-wife-

101
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,496
Oh, I'm so sorry.

102
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,295
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.

103
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:05,425
So I got away with two things: this suit
and what turned out to be a, uh, skirt. Heh.

104
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,553
Well, at least that's a great suit.

105
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,349
Yeah, it wasn't much fun dropping it off
at the dry cleaners in the skirt.

106
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,019
So I need everything down to underwear.

107
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,314
So if you're willing, I'm, uh-
I'm all yours.

108
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,816
Okay.

109
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,777
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?

110
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,779
No, no, that wasn't me.

111
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:31,409
Well, we should get started.
Let me show you my underwear.

112
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,289
The selection of underwear
that we carry.

113
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,880
-Oh, I'm sorry. It's this way.
-It's this way? Sorry.

114
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,382
Oh.

115
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,347
I'm right, right? There was, like,
no chemistry between them.

116
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,641
Before, they had heat.
And now there's no heat.

117
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,062
Now, you know what this means.
Joey told us what this means.

118
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,106
Let's not jump to any conclusions,
all right?

119
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,067
There was some sexual chemistry
between them.

120
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,444
Oh, come on.
It was like cousins having sex up there.

121
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:13,910
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay?
Just be cool. Don't be, you know, you.

122
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,039
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey.

123
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,792
Oh, thank you so much
for coming again.

124
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,794
-Did you like it tonight?
-Absolutely.

125
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,462
Mm.

126
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,090
Wasn't Nick funny when
he couldn't get his match lit?

127
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,633
Mm!

128
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,597
-It's a good play, isn't it?
-Mm.

129
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,017
I loved the play.
Uh, yeah, you were great.

130
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,979
And, uh, Nick, ditto.

131
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,315
Clearly, you're having sex with him.

132
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,945
Okay.

133
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,535
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?

134
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,496
Oh, come on. It was so obvious.
There was no chemistry between you two.

135
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,416
Okay, let me just get this straight.

136
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,295
You're accusing me of cheating on you,
and you're insulting my performance?

137
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,172
You know,
I can see how this could happen.

138
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,383
You know, you're up there every night,
naked, touching, kissing.

139
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,636
Acting. Chandler, this is my job.

140
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,223
I'm playing a part in a play.
How can you not trust me?

141
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,685
Well, you can understand,
given how we started.

142
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,312
Oh, wow.

143
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,689
I can't believe you're throwing that
in my face.

144
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,984
Well, that is what happened,
and I don't even see you denying this.

145
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,030
I'll tell you what, Chandler.
Why don't you call me when you grow up?

146
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,325
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen
any time soon.

147
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,374
Oh, I have the best job
in the entire world.

148
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,293
The most adorable guy
came over today...

149
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,379
...and I got to dress him up all day.

150
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,257
Rachel has a new doll.

151
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,678
Oh, I wish he was a doll. Then I could get
a Rachel doll and bump them together...

152
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,555
...and make kissing noises.

153
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,769
Oh, and he's got the most beautiful name.
I never realized. Joshua.

154
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,188
Oh, Joshua.

155
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,607
Joshua, Josh.

156
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,234
Uh, hello?

157
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,819
Hi.

158
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,572
Ooh, what do I smell?

159
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,950
I don't know, but it smells good.

160
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,000
-Fresh cookies. Hot from the oven.
-Ooh!

161
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,211
-Please have some.
-Oh, yo.

162
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:32,090
I've just been fiddling around in here,
making delicious treats for everyone.

163
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,759
Wow. The new <i>Playboy.</i>

164
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,719
Yeah, just something I picked up.

165
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,056
Cookies and porn?
You're the best mom ever.

166
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,105
What? What?

167
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:52,235
Nothing, it's just something Joshua said
about V-necks, but you had to be there.

168
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,737
How does, uh, Jason look in a V-neck?

169
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,240
-It's Joshua.
-Oh, whatever.

170
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,163
Wait. Wait. This isn't takeout.

171
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,124
-Well, hate to eat and run.
-No, wait, please don't go.

172
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,626
I've got porn for you too.

173
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,545
Yeah, I don't need it.

174
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,215
People are supposed
to want to hang out here.

175
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,259
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?

176
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,678
I'm the hostess.

177
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,848
Not those guys. I'm always the hostess.

178
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,894
I mean, even when I was little, the girls
brought their dollies to my tea party.

179
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,645
I served the best air.

180
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,107
Why did you make a whole big thing...

181
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,651
...out of everyone has to hang out
in the big apartment?

182
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,613
Because they took our apartment.
I wanted to punish them.

183
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,991
But I'm done now.
They've suffered enough.

184
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,579
If you wanted to punish them, you
should have just made them hang out here.

185
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,080
That's true.

186
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,125
All right, this place will be 10 times better
than that place.

187
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,502
Oh, are we gonna trash their place?

188
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,797
Steps.

189
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,551
Slut.

190
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,727
You'll all be very happy to hear
that Kathy is sleeping with that guy.

191
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,562
-What?
-So you were right?

192
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,483
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it.

193
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,486
I don't live here.

194
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,407
-Chandler.
-Chandler, what did she say?

195
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,784
Wait, are you sure?

196
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,703
Well, I may be drunk,
but I know what she said.

197
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,790
So then I went over
to Beefsteak Chewley's....

198
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,086
-Beefsteak Charlie's?
-Yes.

199
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,505
See, you and I have always been like:

200
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,770
Oops.

201
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,524
-Hey, do you need help with that?
-No, I got it.

202
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,695
Oh, I just feel bad. I never vacuum.

203
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,365
-Hey.
-Hey.

204
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:07,412
So I was with Joshua for an hour today,
and he has not asked me out.

205
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,248
-It's so frustrating.
-Why don't you ask him out?

206
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,834
Oh, yeah. Totally. That's such a turn-on.

207
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,503
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?

208
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,131
Ooh, that's the turn-on.

209
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,510
He just got a divorce, right? So he's
probably really nervous around women.

210
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,096
You know? Maybe you just need
to make the first move.

211
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:29,017
-I've never asked a guy out before.
-You've never asked a guy out?

212
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,268
No, have you?

213
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,478
Thousands of times. Ha, ha.

214
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,066
That doesn't make me
sound too good, does it?

215
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,569
I don't even know
how I would go about it.

216
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,448
Oh, what I do is, uh, I look a woman
up and down and I say:

217
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,991
"Hey.

218
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,452
How you doing?"

219
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,122
Oh, please.

220
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,415
Hey.

221
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,334
How you doing?

222
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,506
You know what? I'm gonna do that.

223
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,134
I'm gonna call him up
and I'm gonna ask him out.

224
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,888
-Yeah.
-I can do that. Ask him out.

225
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,848
"How you doing?"

226
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,394
Hi, Joshua?

227
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,147
It's Rachel Green, from Bloomingdale's.

228
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,525
Yeah, um, I was just wondering
if you, um....

229
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,278
If you, urn....

230
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,949
Left your wallet at the store today?

231
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:31,079
Oh, well, we found a wallet, and we-

232
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,333
The license? Oh, that is a good idea.

233
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,420
Uh, well, let's see.
This license belongs to a, uh....

234
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:44,175
Uh, belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.

235
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,804
And, um, yeah.

236
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,809
So okay. So sorry to bother you at home.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

237
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,563
-You've done that a thousand times?
-I've never done that.

238
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,109
Oh, God, I just got so nervous
that he was gonna say no.

239
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:06,030
Well, you gotta give him something
he can't say no to, like, uh, Knicks tickets.

240
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,825
Invite the guy to a Knicks game.
You're guaranteed he'll say yes.

241
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,078
-Really? You think that will work?
-Absolutely, and if doesn't, can I go?

242
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,541
-What the heck is that?
-What is that?

243
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,055
Did she call?

244
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,267
No. Sorry.

245
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,728
-Well, maybe I should call her.
-No.

246
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,314
Forget her, man. You don't need her.
Don't need that.

247
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,025
He's right.
What she did was unforgivable.

248
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,112
Well, yeah, but you know,
what if I was wrong?

249
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,989
How might you be wrong?

250
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,783
Well, you know, what if she didn't
actually sleep with the guy?

251
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,119
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.

252
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,247
She did not have to tell me.
I saw the play and there was no heat.

253
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,708
-Back me up here, Ross.
-That's all your basing this on?

254
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,793
That's not backing me up.

255
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,129
You said, you know,
with the off-stage and the heat...

256
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,173
-...and the on-stage and the heat-
-Whoa, whoa.

257
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,177
That was just a theory.
There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out.

258
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,723
Lone gunman, communism, geometry.

259
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,601
Oh, my God.

260
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,398
"Would you like to go
to a basketball game with-"

261
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,736
"You know, it's funny, basketball,
because I happen to have tickets to-"

262
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,572
No. Okay. Urn....

263
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,284
"Who likes the Knicks?"

264
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,581
-What do you think?
-Oh.

265
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:43,461
Well, as a single woman,
who is available...

266
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,005
...I think you look great.

267
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,674
-Huh. Yeah?
-Yup.

268
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,427
Oh, yeah, you look great.

269
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,893
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this looks great.

270
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,854
Um, so you like it?

271
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,316
I do, I do. I love it.
In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.

272
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:09,612
-Great.
-Well, thank you so much for all your help.

273
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,491
-Well, I guess, uh- I guess this is it.
-Yeah.

274
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,992
Thanks.

275
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,995
Maybe I'll see you in the spring
with the- For the bathing suits.

276
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,289
You don't want to do that now?

277
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,959
Oh, that's okay.

278
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,086
Anyway,
hopefully I'll see you around sometime.

279
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,129
Basketball.

280
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,674
Sorry?

281
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,133
I, uh....

282
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,762
I have two tickets to the Knicks game
tonight if you're interested...

283
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,431
...just as a thank-you for this week.

284
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,352
Wow. That would be great.

285
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,604
-Really?
-Yeah, That would be fantastic.

286
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:47,233
My nephew is crazy about the Knicks.

287
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,196
This is fantastic.
Thank you so much, Rachel.

288
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,198
-Good morning.
-Hi.

289
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,741
Oh.

290
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,292
-Hey.
-Hey.

291
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,337
I just wanted to come over
to say that I'm sorry.

292
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,382
You know, I acted like the biggest idiot
in the world.

293
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,135
And I can completely understand
why you were so upset.

294
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,178
Oh, wow.

295
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,723
I really wish you'd called me.

296
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,599
Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.

297
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,228
But, you know,
I think this is a good thing. You know?

298
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,939
Because we've had our first fight,
and now we can move on.

299
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,067
You know, I mean, I know for me, but-

300
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,242
Nick's pants?

301
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,952
Yeah.

302
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,079
Yeah. Well.

303
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,250
I think our second fight
is going to be a big one.

304
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,926
-Okay, for next time, what do you say?
-"I have an extra ticket."

305
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,347
"An extra ticket." Not "two tickets."
I have and extra ticket.

306
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:05,436
So the first time you asked a guy out
he turned you down?

307
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,608
He didn't turn me down.
He's at the game, isn't he?

308
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,568
I got the date. I'm just not on it.

309
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,116
Okay, it's ready.

310
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,952
-Come on.
-What's ready?

311
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,788
Just come.

312
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,794
Oh, my God.

313
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,255
-Wow.
-Monica, this is beautiful.

314
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,176
Oh, did you work for two days straight?

315
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,470
Pretty much.

316
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,223
So, what do you think of the floor?

317
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,475
I don't know. Looks the same.

318
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,685
You used to have carpet.

319
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,521
Oh, yeah.

320
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,774
So I made snacks.

321
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,234
Please, just hang out, okay?

322
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,612
I'm just gonna rest my eyes
for just a little bit.

323
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,740
Mon, do you want us to come back later?

324
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,953
Oh, no, no, no. Stay, stay, stay.
Just keep talking.

325
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,123
I'm always the hostess.

326
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,709
-Hey.
-How'd it go?

327
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,129
-So?
-Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.

328
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,173
-Oh, good.
-She is now.

329
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:23,848
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying that she is a devil woman.

330
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,724
You think you know a person...

331
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,227
...then they turn around
and they sleep with Nick.

332
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,731
Nick and his rock-hard pecs
and his giant man-nipples.

333
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,695
I hate him. And I hate her.

334
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:41,699
Well, I don't hate her. I love her.
This is all my fault, really.

335
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,201
-Oh.
-How? How is it your fault?

336
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,246
Because, ugh, I should have called.

337
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,833
You know, if I'd just called her, she never
would have gone out with Nick...

338
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,502
...and they wouldn't have ended up
in bed together.

339
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,880
I threw her at his man-nipples.

340
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,967
Honey, this is not your fault.

341
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:04,764
Just because you guys had a fight
does not justify her sleeping with someone.

342
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,518
Well, if she thought
they were on a break....

343
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,197
Rachel, one of your customers seems
to have left his billfold. A Joshua Burgen.

344
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,699
-Really?
-Will you call him?

345
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,911
Yes, I will. Absolutely.

346
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,040
Oh.

347
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,593
Hello, Rachel.

348
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,595
Hi, Joshua.

349
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,223
I left my wallet here on purpose.

350
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,641
Really?

351
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,143
Yes, I just wanted to see you again.

352
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,395
Oh, I'm glad.

353
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,774
Rachel, I'd like to say something to you.

354
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,400
Yes?

355
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,070
How you doing?
