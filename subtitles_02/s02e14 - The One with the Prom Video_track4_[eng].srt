1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,129
-Hey.
-Hey.

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,756
Hold on a second.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,470
Nice. Nice.

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,096
I got you something.

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,183
-What's this?
-Eight hundred and twelve bucks.

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,269
I don't know what Big Leon told you,
but it's a thousand...

7
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,396
...if you want me for the whole night.

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,691
-What is this for?
-Well, I'm making money now.

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,986
And this is paying you back
for headshots, electric bills...

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,489
...and so many slices of pizza
I can't even count.

11
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,617
-I love you, man.
-Well, thanks, man.

12
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,077
Now I can get my pony.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,874
Hey. This is a little extra something
for always being there for me.

14
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,585
Wow, I don't know what to say.

15
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,885
Wow, I don't know what to say.

16
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,806
-Eh? What do you say?
-I don't know.

17
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:58,725
It's a bracelet.

18
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:02,062
Isn't it? It's engraved too. Check it out.

19
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,231
"To my best bud."

20
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,570
Thanks, best bud.

21
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,324
-Put it on.
-Oh. Now?

22
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,413
No, something this nice should be saved
for a special occasion.

23
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,583
No, that's the beauty part.
It goes with everything.

24
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,752
When you put this on,
you're good to go.

25
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,301
Oh, man!

26
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,429
You are so wearing that bracelet!

27
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,973
I so am!

28
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,727
Oh! Any idea what this will
do for your sex life?

29
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,812
It'll probably slow it down at first...

30
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,107
...but once I'm used to the extra weight,
I'll be back on track.

31
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,492
-This all looks good.
-Great.

32
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,828
If I want to call for a reference
on your last job...?

33
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,207
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see?
The manager, Chandler Bing?

34
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,750
All right.

35
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:51,004
Let's see if you're as good in person
as you are on paper. Make me a salad.

36
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,508
A salad? I could do
something more complicated.

37
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,511
No, just the salad will be fine.

38
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,429
You got it.

39
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:04,267
Now I want you to tell me
what you're doing while you're doing it.

40
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,397
All right. Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

41
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,065
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?

42
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,733
Oh, no, no. I'm gonna wash it.

43
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,194
Don't. I like it dirty.

44
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,407
That's your call.

45
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,743
So, uh, what are you going to do next?

46
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,496
I thought that I'd
cut up the tomatoes.

47
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,998
Are they firm?

48
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,295
-They're okay.
-You sure they haven't gone bad?

49
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,173
You sure they're not very, very bad?

50
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,470
Ahem. No, really, they're okay.

51
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,973
You gonna slice them up real nice?

52
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,100
I was going to do them julienne.

53
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,229
I'm out of here!

54
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,239
Hello?

55
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,367
Rachel's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

56
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,494
All right. And how do we spell Casey?

57
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,456
Is it like "at the bat"
or "and The Sunshine Band"?

58
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,041
Okay, bye-bye.

59
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,795
Hey, who's this Casey?

60
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,630
Some guy she met at the movies.

61
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,591
What does he want with her?

62
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,968
I'm guessing he wants to
do a little dance...

63
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,264
...you know, make a little love....

64
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,519
Well, pretty much get down tonight.

65
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,401
I don't know. I don't-

66
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,238
I don't get it! Two months ago,
Rachel and I were this close.

67
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,867
Now I'm taking messages from guys
she meets at the movies?

68
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:48,038
I mean, this Casey should be
taking down my messages, you know?

69
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,249
Or Rachel and I should be together...

70
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,503
...and we should get
some kind of message service.

71
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,088
Hang in there.
It's gonna happen.

72
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,757
Now how do you know that?

73
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,760
Because she's your lobster.

74
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,514
Oh, she's going somewhere.

75
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:12,187
It's a known fact that lobsters
fall in love and mate for life.

76
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,525
You know what? You can actually
see old lobster couples...

77
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,487
...walking around their tank,
holding claws, like....

78
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,159
Hey, you feeling better?

79
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,746
Yeah, I think that fifth shower
actually got the interview off me.

80
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,499
So do you have any other possibilities?

81
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,961
Yeah. There is the possibility
that I won't make rent.

82
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,129
Monica, if you want,
I can lend you money.

83
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,132
No, no. If I couldn't pay you
back right away...

84
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,802
...then I'd feel guilty and tense
every time I saw you.

85
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,013
Oh. Then why don't you borrow it
from Mom and Dad?

86
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,016
You feel guilty and tense
around them already.

87
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,811
Might as well
make some money off of them.

88
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,438
-The man's got a point.
-Ohh.

89
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,567
What is that sparkly thing?

90
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,194
That thing? It's a, uh-

91
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,657
Yeah, it's a little flashy.

92
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,909
No, no.

93
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,621
No, no. It's not flashy.
Not for a goodfella.

94
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:18,670
Man, that is sharp! That must
have cost you quite a few doubloons.

95
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,551
-Hi.
-Hi.

96
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,678
-Hi, darling.
-So what's this?

97
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,346
Some of your old stuff.

98
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:34,185
Well, sweetie, we have a surprise for you.
We're turning your room into a gym.

99
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,398
Wow, that is a surprise!

100
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,067
Just one little question.
Why not Ross' room?

101
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,694
Gosh, we talked about that...

102
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:47,574
...but your brother had so many science
trophies, plaques, merit badges....

103
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,701
Well, we didn't want to disturb them.

104
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,328
God forbid!

105
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,916
-Ohh.
-Hi.

106
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,876
Hi, Rachel. Aww.

107
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:01,421
We were so sorry to hear
about your parents splitting up.

108
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,383
Well, they're just separated.
You never know! We'll see.

109
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,802
I can't say any of us were surprised.

110
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,474
Your parents have been unhappy
ever since we've known them.

111
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,894
-Oh.
-Especially after that incident in Hawaii.

112
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,814
What? What incident?

113
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,234
Um, no, no.
I must be thinking of someone else.

114
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,070
Maybe me! Ha!

115
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,240
Don't you have some folding to do?
Go fold, dear. Fold. You fold.

116
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,914
-Want a refill?
-No. I'm all right, thanks.

117
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,544
You gotta give me a second.
I want to get this just right.

118
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,505
Ahem.

119
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,511
Dude, 11:00,
totally hot babe checking you out.

120
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,142
That was really good.
I think I'm ready for my penis now.

121
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,195
I know what you're thinking.
Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.

122
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,824
-I'm Gail.
-Chandler.

123
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:16,705
I.... I really have to be somewhere,
but it was nice meeting you.

124
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,040
What?

125
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,297
This is excellent!

126
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,175
He could've gotten me a VCR
or a set of golf clubs.

127
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,469
But no! He has to get me
the "woman repeller"!

128
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,598
The eyesore from
the Liberace House of Crap!

129
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,685
-It's not that bad.
-Easy for you to say.

130
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,021
You're not sporting a reject
from the Mr. T collection!

131
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,440
Chandler. Chandler.

132
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:47,193
"I pity the fool that puts on
my jewelry! I do! I do!

133
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,404
I pity that fool-" Ay.

134
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,367
Hey, man!
We were just doing some impressions.

135
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,994
Do your Marcel Marceau.

136
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,789
That's actually good.

137
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,510
Would you look at that guy?
How long has he been talking to her?

138
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,848
It's like, back off, buddy!
She's a waitress, not a geisha.

139
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,225
I think she's okay.

140
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,189
Look at that! See how she's
pushing him away and he won't budge?

141
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,274
I'm gonna do something.

142
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:32,572
We'll get a condo right on the mountain.
Ski in, ski out, it's great.

143
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,533
Excuse me? Are you Rachel?

144
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,076
What?

145
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,370
Ross Geller.

146
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,374
God, in your ad you said
you were pretty, but wow!

147
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,419
What are you doing?

148
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,464
Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?

149
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,092
I don't believe it!

150
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,136
If it works out, we'll have something
to tell the grandkids!

151
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,679
You sure will.

152
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,640
I've gotta go.

153
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,642
-Take care.
-Okay.

154
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,060
-See you later.
-Ohh.

155
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,981
You're welcome.

156
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,069
-What?
-I was saving you.

157
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,989
Saving me from the pleasant conversation
with the interesting man?

158
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,076
-From where I was-
-Okay, Ross, listen to me.

159
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,954
I am not yours to save.

160
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,873
-But you are.
-What?

161
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,584
Uh, well, urn- You're my lobster.

162
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,341
Okay. Are you being
the blind-date guy again?

163
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,387
No, you're my lobster.

164
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,056
See, urn.... Lobsters....

165
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:43,601
Uh, in the tank, when they're old...

166
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,606
...they get with the-
They walk around holding the claws.

167
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,026
In the tank!
You know, with...

168
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,946
...with the holding and....

169
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,032
Pheebs, you wanna help me
with the lobster thing?

170
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,076
Do the claws again.

171
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,289
Rach, forget the lobsters, okay?

172
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,291
Let's talk- What about us?

173
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,752
Ross, there is no "us," okay?

174
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,380
-No, but-
-No! Listen to me!

175
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,883
I fell for you and I get clobbered.

176
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,011
You then fall for me
and I again get clobbered.

177
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,848
I'm tired of being clobbered,
you know?

178
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,641
It's just not worth it.

179
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,101
Well, but-

180
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,228
No "but," Ross.

181
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:31,316
We are never gonna happen, okay?
Accept that.

182
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,527
Except- Except that what?

183
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,115
No. No.

184
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,036
Accept that.

185
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,498
Oh.

186
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,215
Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud!
How you doing?

187
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,762
Wow. You're getting good at that
Marcel Marceau thing.

188
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,017
What do you say we play some ball?
You and me, huh? What do you say?

189
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,521
Okay, that's my bad.

190
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,318
If you hated the bracelet,
you should have just said so.

191
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,570
Doesn't the fact that I wore it...

192
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,657
...say how much
our friendship means to me?

193
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,786
What about the fact that you insulted
the bracelet and you made fun of me?

194
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,039
Well, that's the part
where I'm a wank.

195
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,167
I was hoping you
wouldn't focus on that.

196
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,171
Come on, man!
I said I was sorry a hundred times.

197
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,840
I promise, I will never
take it off my...

198
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,842
...wrist.

199
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,890
But if you want to stay in there
and be mad...

200
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,059
...you just, you stay in there.

201
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,936
You know what the-

202
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,188
I am here, on my knees...

203
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,818
...holding up these couch cushions...

204
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,737
...as a symbol
of my sorrow and regret.

205
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,158
Much like they did
in biblical times.

206
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,244
Though you may haveth anger now....

207
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,169
You know, that Steffi Graf
has quite a tush.

208
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,631
I'm just saying! It's right there!

209
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,968
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, darling.

210
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,387
Where's my grandson?
You didn't bring him?

211
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,473
No. He's at Carol and Susan's today.

212
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,976
A woman in my office is a lesbian.

213
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,146
I'm just saying!

214
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,734
Jack, look! There's that house
paint commercial that cracks you up!

215
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,783
-Where have you been?
-Emotional hell.

216
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,577
So did they lend you the money?

217
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,620
No, I haven't asked them yet.

218
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,456
Come on, Monica, do it.

219
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,124
Hey, you guys.

220
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,418
Monica has some news.

221
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,923
So listen, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you this before, but...

222
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,720
...I'm no longer at my job.
I had to leave it.

223
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,182
-Why?
-Because they made me.

224
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:14,312
You were fired?
What are you gonna do?

225
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,816
Judy, relax. This is our little Harmonica
we're talking about.

226
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,276
We taught her well.

227
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:24,655
-Ten percent of your paycheck goes where?
-In the bank.

228
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,409
So she dips into her savings.
That's what it's there for.

229
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,994
She's gonna be fine.

230
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,038
If you need a little extra...

231
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,415
...you know where to find it.

232
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,709
Anything larger back there?

233
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,088
I can't believe it!

234
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,881
Would you stop already?

235
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,093
Get out of the bitter barn
and play in the hay.

236
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,804
Oh, you're right.
I should play in the hay.

237
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:52,308
For about the fact I just dropped $400
to replace a bracelet I hated to begin with.

238
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,227
Bring on the hay!

239
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,229
Hey!

240
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,650
I've got something
that'll make you happy.

241
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,568
Guess what Gunther found?

242
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,654
Ohh!

243
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,697
Hey, now you have two!

244
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,201
Oh, now you have two.

245
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,872
What am I gonna do?

246
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,541
Hey.

247
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,502
Hey.

248
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,380
How come you have two?

249
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,258
This one's for you.

250
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,053
-Get out!
-No, I can't.

251
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,683
I know how much this means to you...

252
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,185
...and I also know this is
about more than jewelry.

253
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,939
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're "best buds."

254
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,986
Wow. Is this friendship? I think so!

255
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,115
Check it out!
We're bracelet buddies!

256
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,784
That's what they'll call us!

257
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,998
Okay, here you go.
Pay me back whenever you like.

258
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,333
You have dinosaur checks?

259
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,921
Yeah. You get your money
and you learn something.

260
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,381
What's wrong with that?

261
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,799
Nothing.

262
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,719
Hey, you're a cheap-a-saurus!

263
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:15,224
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Thank you, I'm very grateful.

264
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,893
Hey, Mon, what is this?

265
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,187
Oh, urn....

266
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,357
That's my bathing suit from high school.
I was a little bigger then.

267
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:28,070
Oh, I thought that's what they used
to cover Connecticut when it rains.

268
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,449
Hey, what's on this videotape?

269
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,326
You got me. Let's put it in.

270
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,999
-Hi.
-Hey.

271
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,630
<i>Over here, Jack. Okay.</i>

272
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,965
<i>Rachel's coming up the path.</i>

273
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,343
<i>Doesn't she look pretty? Jack?</i>

274
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,719
<i>Can you get this?</i>

275
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,224
Oh, my God!

276
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,434
What is with your nose?

277
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,899
They had to reduce it
because of my deviated septum.

278
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:09,153
Okay, I was wrong. That's
what they use to cover Connecticut.

279
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,157
-This is us getting ready for the prom.
-Ah!

280
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,118
-We don't have to watch.
-Yeah, we do.

281
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,745
-Come on!
-It's fun!

282
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,372
<i>Get a shot of Monica.</i>

283
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,083
<i>-Where's Monica?
-Over here, Dad!</i>

284
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,211
<i>Wait. How do you zoom out?</i>

285
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,965
<i>There she is!</i>

286
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,178
Some girl ate Monica!

287
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,392
Shut up!
The camera adds ten pounds.

288
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,228
So how many cameras
are actually on you?

289
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,358
<i>Oh, you look so great!</i>

290
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,319
<i>So do you! You look beautiful!</i>

291
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,446
<i>-Oops.
-What?</i>

292
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,282
<i>I think I got mayonnaise on you.</i>

293
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,034
<i>Oh, it's just the shoulder,
not my dress.</i>

294
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,163
<i>Everybody smile!</i>

295
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,416
<i>Oh, Dad, turn it off!</i>

296
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,961
<i>-It is off.</i>
<i>-It is not! What's with the red light?</i>

297
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,464
<i>It's the off light. Right, Ross?</i>

298
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,599
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.

299
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,565
<i>-You look pretty tonight.
-Oh, thanks.</i>

300
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,863
<i>-What are you doing this summer?
-I'm gonna hang out...</i>

301
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,115
<i>...work on my music.</i>

302
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,997
<i>Is my hook unhooked?
These things keep falling down.</i>

303
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,757
<i>Let me see. I don't know.
What are you gonna do-</i>

304
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,718
<i>Oh! The guys are here!</i>

305
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,136
<i>—this summer?</i>

306
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:58,429
Work on your music?

307
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,270
Oh, my God! There's Roy Gublik!

308
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,691
You know, Roy saw <i>Star Wars </i>317 times.

309
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,193
His name was in the paper.

310
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,989
<i>Where's Chip?
Why isn't he here yet?</i>

311
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,909
<i>He'll be here, okay? Take a chill pill.</i>

312
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,828
<i>There.</i>

313
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,961
I just told Rachel
that Roy touched my boob.

314
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,426
<i>I can't go to the prom without a date.
I can't! It's too late!</i>

315
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,596
<i>If you're not going,
then I don't want to go either.</i>

316
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,349
<i>Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!</i>

317
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,186
<i>I have a wonderful idea.</i>

318
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,147
<i>You should take Rachel to the prom.</i>

319
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:55,319
<i>-Doubtful.</i>
<i>-Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.</i>

320
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,115
<i>All right, go on. This thing's heavy.</i>

321
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,910
<i>Your mother's right. Take her.
You can wear my tux.</i>

322
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,578
<i>She won't wanna go with me.</i>

323
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,707
<i>Of course she would!
You're a college man!</i>

324
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,209
<i>-I don't know.
-Well, come on.</i>

325
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,253
<i>Don't you wanna find out?</i>

326
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,965
<i>I can't believe I can't go to the prom!</i>

327
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,716
<i>This is so harsh!</i>

328
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,349
<i>-Hold my board.
-Attaboy! Attaboy!</i>

329
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,435
I think we've seen enough.

330
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,478
-Let's turn it off.
-No, no, no!

331
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,647
Well, I'm not gonna watch.

332
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,358
<i>Come on, kid. Let's go!</i>

333
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,239
<i>-My! Are you handsome!
-Let's show them!</i>

334
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,158
<i>Just a sec, Dad.</i>

335
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,619
<i>Okay, be cool. Just be cool.</i>

336
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,422
<i>Okay, Dad.</i>

337
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,426
<i>Rachel, ready or not,
here comes your knight in shining-</i>

338
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,886
<i>Oh, no.</i>

339
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,054
<i>Bye! Don't wait up!</i>

340
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,015
<i>Chip!</i>

341
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,560
<i>Oh, dear!</i>

342
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,437
<i>Jack. How do I turn this off?</i>

343
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:12,980
<i>Press the button.</i>

344
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,107
<i>Which one? Which button? Jack!</i>

345
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,901
<i>The button! The button!</i>

346
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,115
I can't believe you did that.

347
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,120
Yeah, well....

348
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,734
See? He's her lobster!

349
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,827
<i>Dance with him!</i>

350
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,496
<i>Mom, I'm hungry!</i>

351
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,706
<i>Dance with your father.</i>

352
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:17,211
<i>I don't know any of your flashdances,
but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.</i>

353
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,171
<i>All right.</i>

354
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,513
<i>-Oh, Jack!
-Oh, Judy!</i>

355
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,102
<i>Oh, Judy!</i>
