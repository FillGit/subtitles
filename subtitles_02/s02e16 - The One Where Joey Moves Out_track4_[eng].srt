1
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,340
Man, this is weird.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,218
Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's
eyebrows are on his hat?

3
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:10,552
That's what's weird?

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,722
The man's been captain
of a cereal for 40 years.

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,768
Whoa, yuck!

6
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:18,977
What?

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,897
The spoon!
You licked and you put.

8
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,276
You licked and you put.

9
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,569
Yeah, so?

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:32,533
Don't you see how gross that is?
It's like you using my toothbrush!

11
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,743
You used my toothbrush?

12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,249
Only because I used the red one
to unclog the drain.

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,584
Mine is the red one!

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,590
Oh, God!
Can open. Worms everywhere!

15
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,927
Why can't we use the same toothbrush...

16
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,096
...but we can use the same soap?

17
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:58,141
Because soap is soap.
It's self-cleaning.

18
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,727
The next time you shower...

19
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,856
...think about the last thing I wash
and the first thing you wash.

20
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,408
-Hey.
-Hey.

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,536
Look at you fancy lads!

22
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,204
What's the occasion?

23
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,124
You know that guy on my show
that's in a coma?

24
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,044
He's having a brunch.

25
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,755
Ready when you are.

26
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,550
I can't believe you're
actually getting tattoos.

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,844
You guys are getting tattoos?

28
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,389
But you cannot tell Ross
because I wanna surprise him.

29
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,434
Wow, this is wild!
What are you gonna get?

30
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,978
I'm getting a lily.

31
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,523
For my mom, because her name's Lily.

32
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,903
That's lucky. What if
her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

33
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,782
-Where you getting it?
-On my shoulder.

34
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,033
What?

35
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,202
What's on your shoulder?

36
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,662
A chip.

37
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,292
-A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.
-A tattoo?

38
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,378
Why? Why would you wanna do that?

39
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,171
-Hi.
-Hi.

40
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,548
You don't think
they're kind of cool?

41
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,675
No. Sorry, I don't.

42
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,179
Why would anyone pay someone
to scar their body for life?

43
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,515
What if it doesn't come out right?

44
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,810
It's like having
a bad haircut all the time.

45
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,772
Why is everyone staring at me?

46
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,733
Sign this card for Dad.
Richard will be here soon.

47
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,777
Richard's going to the party too?

48
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,363
He's my parents' best friend.
He has to go.

49
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,866
So is today the day
you'll tell them about you two?

50
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:24,204
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,
I decided to give him a stroke.

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,332
No, I think you should tell them.

52
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,002
I don't know how serious he is.
Until I do, I won't say anything.

53
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,588
I don't think
Mom and Dad would mind.

54
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,800
Remember when you were 9
and Richard was 30, Dad said:

55
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,844
"God, I hope they get together."

56
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,142
Shall we?

57
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,935
Okay, wait.

58
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,812
You know what?

59
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,149
Ross, let's switch places.
You get in the middle.

60
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,819
This looks like we're trying
to cover something up.

61
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,656
You could come in straddling him,
they still wouldn't believe it.

62
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,410
We're here!

63
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,371
-Hi, kids!
-The children!

64
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,458
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Thank you.

65
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,917
Happy birthday!

66
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,628
So you kids thanked
Dr. Burke for the ride?

67
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,799
Actually, Mom, I think Monica
thanked him for the both of us.

68
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,553
So you kids take the train in?

69
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,264
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

70
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,766
Speaking of whom...

71
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,895
...I hear he's got some
20-year-old twinkie in the city.

72
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,776
Finger cramp! Oh, God!

73
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,361
Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

74
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,450
So Richard's shopping
in the junior section?

75
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,786
Are we still on that?

76
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,498
You just know she's got
the IQ of a napkin.

77
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,583
She's probably not even pretty.

78
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,545
Just young enough so that
everything is still pointing up.

79
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,971
Can you believe this place?

80
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,057
I know. This is a great apartment.

81
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,185
In the bathroom there's mirrors
on both sides of you.

82
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,772
When you're in there, it's like
peeing with the Rockettes.

83
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,608
Well, there's my fantasy come true.

84
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,235
Seriously.

85
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,487
Hey.

86
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,656
We were just saying, great apartment!

87
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,824
Thanks. You want it?

88
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,535
I'm moving to a bigger place.

89
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,495
You should take this one.

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,914
Can you see me in a place like this?

91
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,584
Why not? You hate park views
and high ceilings?

92
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,836
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

93
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,049
That's all right,
I saw a kitchen this morning.

94
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,300
On TV.

95
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,970
Stop talking. Okay!

96
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,723
-Come on, tell us!
-Is she really 20?

97
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,809
I am not telling you guys anything.

98
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,853
Come on, it's my birthday.
Let me live vicariously!

99
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,731
Dad, you really don't want to do that.

100
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,609
What's a little midlife crisis
between friends?

101
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,319
Would you let it go?

102
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,990
I know what you're going through.
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

103
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,492
You got your own little speedster.

104
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,162
-Seriously, it's not like that.
-Tell you what.

105
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,375
Maybe one of these weekends
you can borrow the car and I could-

106
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,003
Dad, I beg you not
to finish that sentence!

107
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,046
What? I'm kidding!

108
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,133
You know I'd never let him
touch the Porsche.

109
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,100
Okay, Rach.

110
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,478
Which lily?
This lily or that lily?

111
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,398
-Well, I-
-I like this lily.

112
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,067
It's more open
and that's like my mom.

113
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,778
She had a more open, giving spirit.

114
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,281
Foghorn Leghorn!

115
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,243
Blond girl?
You're in room two.

116
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,954
Not-so-blond girl, you're with me.

117
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,248
-Here we go!
-Uh-huh.

118
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,751
You're not going.

119
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,002
Uh-huh.

120
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,212
Is this because of what Ross said?

121
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,672
No.

122
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,593
-Well, yeah, maybe.
-I don't believe this.

123
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,680
Is this how this relationship works?
Ross equals boss?

124
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,059
Come on, what is this, 1922?

125
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,019
What's 1922?

126
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,772
Just, you know, a long time ago.

127
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,818
When men used to tell women
what to do a lot.

128
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,697
Then there was suffrage, which was
a good thing. But it sounds horrible.

129
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,535
Do you want this tattoo?

130
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,788
Yes, I do.
It's just that Ross-

131
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,791
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

132
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,752
No.

133
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,587
Who is the boss of you?

134
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,298
You?

135
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,885
No. You are the boss of you!

136
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,055
You march in there and
get that tattoo on your hip!

137
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,057
Go!

138
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,398
How you doing?

139
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,233
I'm a twinkie!

140
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,569
Really? I'm a hero.

141
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,991
This is so hard.

142
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,285
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

143
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,247
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

144
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,125
Maybe we should just tell
your parents first.

145
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,419
My parents are dead.

146
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,755
God, you are so lucky!

147
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,509
I mean-
Well, you know what I mean.

148
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,429
Just hang in there, okay?

149
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,765
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

150
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,482
Judy! Going to the bathroom.
Good for you!

151
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,406
Thank you, Richard.
I appreciate the support.

152
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,619
Honey.

153
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,415
Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat?
Bob doesn't believe I have one.

154
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,125
I have no idea.

155
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,128
Did you know Richard
has a twinkie in the city?

156
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,383
I know. He's a new man.
It's like a scene from <i>Cocoon.</i>

157
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,512
I just never would have
pictured Richard with a bimbo.

158
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,640
He told Johnny Shapiro
that she's quite a girl.

159
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,436
He told Johnny that he thinks
he's falling in love with her.

160
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,147
-Really?
-I've never seen him this happy.

161
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,815
So, Jack...

162
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,902
...ever think about trading me in
for a younger model?

163
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,279
Of course not.

164
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,032
With you, it's like
I've got two 25-year-olds.

165
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,246
Oh, Jack, stop!

166
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,290
Come on!

167
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,418
It's my birthday!

168
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,840
Can we drop this?

169
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,301
I am not interested
in the guy's apartment.

170
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,722
Oh, please. I saw the way
you were checking out his moldings.

171
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,015
You want it.

172
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,267
Why would I want another apartment?

173
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,686
I've already got
an apartment that I love.

174
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,064
It wouldn't kill you
to say it once in a while.

175
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,780
All right. You want the truth?
I'm thinking about it.

176
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,491
-What?
-I'm sorry.

177
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,619
I'm 28. I've never lived alone...

178
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,789
...and I'm at a place
where I got enough money...

179
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,541
...that I don't need a roommate.

180
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,002
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't need a roommate either.

181
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,755
I can afford to live here by myself.

182
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,634
I may have to bring in somebody
once a week to lick the silverware.

183
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,971
Why are you getting
so bent out of shape?

184
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,473
We didn't agree to live
together forever.

185
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,350
We're not Bert and Ernie.

186
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,562
You know what?

187
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,564
If this is the way you feel...

188
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,649
...then maybe you should take it.

189
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,694
-That's how I feel.
-Then maybe you should take it!

190
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,903
Maybe I will!

191
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,405
-Fine with me!
-Great!

192
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,408
You can spend more quality time
with your real friends...

193
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,285
...the spoons!

194
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,413
Whose drink can I freshen?

195
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,958
Almost time for cake!

196
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,385
Mon?

197
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,304
Mon, are you okay?

198
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:23,558
-Remember that video of Mom and Dad?
-Yeah?

199
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,352
-Well, I just caught the live show.
-Ew!

200
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,408
-Hey there.
-What?

201
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:45,038
Nothing. I just heard
something nice about you.

202
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,123
Really?

203
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,708
Richard?

204
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,755
-Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?
-Not that I know of.

205
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,467
I was thinking, why doesn't
he give Monica a call?

206
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,931
That's an idea.

207
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,267
Well, actually,
I'm already seeing someone.

208
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,727
-Oh?
-Oh?

209
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,604
Oh....

210
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,608
She never tells us anything.

211
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,277
Ross, did you know
Monica's seeing someone?

212
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,822
Mom, there are
so many people in my life.

213
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,076
Some are seeing people
and some aren't.

214
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,036
Is that crystal?

215
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,582
So who's the mystery man?

216
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,627
Well, he's a doctor.

217
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,295
A real doctor?

218
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,714
No, a doctor of meat.

219
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,425
Of course he's a real doctor.

220
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,302
And he's handsome.

221
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,973
And he's sweet,
and I know you'd like him.

222
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,183
Well, that's wonderful.

223
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,274
Mom, it's okay.

224
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,526
It is, Judy.

225
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,194
Jack!

226
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,782
Could you come in here for a moment?

227
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,325
Now!

228
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,787
-Found it!
-I'll take that, Dad.

229
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:16,045
It seems your daughter and Richard
are something of an item.

230
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,882
That's impossible.
He's got a twinkie in the city.

231
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,385
I'm the twinkie.

232
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,179
-You're the twinkie?
-She's not a twinkie!

233
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,433
Look, this is the best relationship
I've been in-

234
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,352
Oh, please! A relationship?

235
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,021
Yes, a relationship!

236
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,481
For your information,
I'm crazy about this man.

237
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,816
Really?

238
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,526
Yes.

239
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,196
Am I supposed to stand here
and listen to this on my birthday?

240
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,618
This is a good thing. You said
you've never seen Richard happier.

241
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,828
When did I say that?

242
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,623
Upstairs in the bathroom,
right before you felt up Mom!

243
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,002
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

244
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,756
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

245
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:04,343
<i>Happy birthday, dear Jack</i>

246
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:09,348
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

247
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,895
It looks so good!
Oh, I love it.

248
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,231
I know, so do I!
I'm so glad you made me do this.

249
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,317
Okay, let me see yours.

250
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,739
Let's see yours again.

251
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,284
We just saw mine.
Let me see yours.

252
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,538
Oh, no!

253
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,708
It's gone! That's so weird.

254
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,711
I don't know how, where it went.

255
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,173
You didn't get it?

256
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,466
No.

257
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,093
Why not?

258
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,761
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

259
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,555
How could you do this to me?
This was your idea!

260
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,351
I know! I was gonna get it,
but he came in with this needle.

261
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,229
And did you know
they do this with needles?

262
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,148
Really? You don't say?

263
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,276
Because mine was licked on by kittens!

264
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,447
-Hey.
-Hey.

265
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,157
I'm sorry about what-

266
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,826
-Yeah, me too.
-I know.

267
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,123
Do we need to hug?

268
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,543
No, we're all right.

269
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,671
So I got you something.

270
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,298
Plastic spoons!

271
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,595
-Great!
-Lick away, my man!

272
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,975
These will go great in my new place
till I get real ones.

273
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,810
What?

274
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,648
I can't use these forever.
They're no friend of the environment.

275
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,193
No, I mean what's this
about your new place?

276
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,362
I'm moving out,
like we talked about.

277
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,573
I didn't think that was serious.

278
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,369
You know, I thought
that was just a fight.

279
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,288
Well, it was a fight...

280
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,790
...based on serious stuff, remember?

281
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,168
About how I never
lived alone or anything?

282
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,379
I think it would be good for me.
Help me to grow...

283
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,964
...or whatever.

284
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,887
Well, there you go.

285
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,891
Hey, are you cool with this?

286
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,809
I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

287
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,853
I've never been lower or wetter.

288
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,441
I'll be fine.
I'll just turn your...

289
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,276
...bedroom into a game room.

290
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,778
Put the foosball table in there.

291
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,741
Why do you get to keep the table?

292
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,537
I did pay for half of it.

293
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:40,875
I paid for the other half.

294
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,836
I'll tell you what.
I'll play you for it.

295
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,130
All right, you're on.

296
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,550
I can take two minutes
out of my day to kick your ass.

297
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,263
Your men will get scored on
more times than your sister.

298
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,019
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

299
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,397
Which sister?

300
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,153
So are you sorry that I told them?

301
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,449
No. It's been a long time
since your dad and I went running.

302
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:18,955
Did you get it?

303
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,957
-Is Ross here?
-He went out for pizza.

304
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,625
Okay, really quick.

305
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,461
That's great!

306
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,921
Very tasteful.

307
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,465
-Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine?
-Yes!

308
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,634
What? You didn't get one.

309
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,512
Okay. Well then, what is this?

310
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,474
What are we looking at?

311
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,185
That blue freckle?

312
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,105
That's my tattoo.

313
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,899
That is not a tattoo.
That is a nothing.

314
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,734
I got her in the chair...

315
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:52,863
...he barely touched her with the
needle, she screamed and that was it.

316
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,740
Okay, hi!

317
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,371
For your information,
this is exactly what I wanted.

318
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,001
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen
from a great, great distance.

319
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,755
It's the way my mother
sees me from heaven.

320
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,509
Oh, what a load of crap!

321
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,262
That is a dot!

322
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:21,225
Your mother's in heaven going,
"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"

323
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,314
That is not a tattoo!
This is a tattoo!

324
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,611
You got a tattoo?

325
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:34,989
Maybe.

326
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,160
But just a little one.
Phoebe got the whole world!

327
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,913
Well, let me see.

328
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,627
Well?

329
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,378
Well, it's really...

330
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,506
...sexy.

331
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,217
I wouldn't have thought
it would be, but...

332
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,178
...wow!

333
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,057
Really?

334
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,767
Yeah, so....

335
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,562
So is it sore?
Or can you do stuff?

336
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,274
I guess.

337
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,401
Save us some pizza.

338
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,659
Get it out of the corner!

339
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,663
Pass it! Pass it!

340
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,082
Stop talking to your men!

341
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,542
Yes!

342
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,544
And the table is mine.

343
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,300
Congratulations.

344
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,357
You guys will still
come visit me, right?

345
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,275
Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.

346
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,695
We'll be over there all the time.

347
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,572
Except when we are here.

348
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,330
I know you're just moving uptown,
but I'll really miss you.

349
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,667
How can you not be
across the hall anymore?

350
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,046
Who's gonna eat all of our food
and tie up our phone lines-

351
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,132
Is that my bra?

352
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,138
-What are you doing with my bra?
-It's not what you think.

353
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,474
We used it to fling
water balloons off the roof.

354
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,104
Remember? Those kids couldn't
even get theirs across the street.

355
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,148
Yeah, I remember.

356
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:38,028
Let's bring the rest of these
down to the truck.

357
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,792
You want me to...

358
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,503
...give you a hand
with the foosball table?

359
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:55,880
Nan....

360
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,008
You keep it.
You need the practice.

361
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,428
Thanks.

362
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,513
So...

363
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,599
...I guess this is it.

364
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,100
Yeah, right.

365
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,643
I guess so.

366
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,064
Listen....

367
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,609
When am I gonna see you?

368
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,986
I'm guessing tonight
at the coffeehouse.

369
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,614
Right. Yeah. Okay.

370
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,116
Take care.
