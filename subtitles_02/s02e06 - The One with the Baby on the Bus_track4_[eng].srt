1
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:04,796
Who the winny-binny boy?

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,800
Oh,
you the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,052
Yes.

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,597
Don't cry.

5
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:17,309
Don't cry, huh?

6
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,728
Why is he still crying?

7
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,064
Let me hold him for a sec.

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,191
Here we go. Huh?

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,984
Huh. There we are.

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,904
Maybe it's me.

11
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:33,116
Don't be silly. Ben loves you.
He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.

12
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,286
You know, I once dated
a Miss Cranky Pants.

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,290
Lovely girl. Kind of moody.

14
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,417
There we go, all better.

15
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,962
There's my little boy. Eh.

16
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,720
Can I, uh, see something?

17
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,070
-Cool!
-He hates me.

18
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,698
-My nephew hates me!
-Come on, don't do this.

19
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,617
What if my own baby hates me, huh?
What do I do then?

20
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,327
Monica, stop! This is nuts.

21
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,206
Do you know how long it'll be
before you have to deal with this?

22
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,001
You don't even have a boyfriend yet.

23
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,464
Joey, she does not look fat.

24
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,764
Here you go.

25
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,223
Oh, hey, Mon.

26
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,520
Goo, goo, goo!

27
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,568
That is so funny!
Let me see that a sec. Ha-ha-ha.

28
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,070
Whoa.

29
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,243
You okay?

30
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,578
I don't know.

31
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,290
What's in this pie?

32
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,378
I don't know. Um, butter and eggs
and flour and lime and kiwi-

33
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,588
Kiwi? Kiwi?!

34
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,924
You said it was a key lime pie.

35
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:58,053
No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime.
That's what makes it so special.

36
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,138
That's what's gonna kill me.

37
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,600
Ahem. I'm allergic to kiwi.

38
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,895
No, you're not. You're allergic
to lobster and peanuts and-

39
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,276
-Oh, my God!
-Uh. It's definitely getting worse.

40
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,737
All right. Is your tongue swelling up?

41
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,074
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller!

42
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,827
-Get your coat. We'll to the hospital.
-Uh.

43
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,287
-Will he be okay?
-He's gotta get a shot.

44
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,874
Uh, you know, actually,
it's getting better. It is.

45
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,460
Let's not go. Anyone up for Scrabble?

46
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,296
Jacket, now!

47
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,092
What about Ben?
We can't bring a baby to the hospital.

48
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,593
We'll watch him.

49
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,471
Uh. Ha, I don't think so.

50
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,309
What? I have seven Catholic sisters.
I've taken care of hundreds of kids.

51
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,312
Come on, we want to do it.
Don't we?

52
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,606
I was gonna play basketball...

53
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,733
...but I guess that's out the window.

54
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,071
If you take him out
for a walk, remember to bring his hat.

55
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,158
There's milk in the refrigerator
and diapers in the bag.

56
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,952
Hat, milk.... Got it!

57
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,662
-Let's go.
-Okay.

58
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,838
Consider it done!

59
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,214
You understood?

60
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,176
My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

61
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,597
Is he the one
with the beautiful wife?

62
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,353
Hey, Rach.

63
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,023
You want to hear the song
I'm singing this afternoon?

64
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,067
-I wrote it this morning in the shower.
-Okay.

65
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:42,574
<i>I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song</i>

66
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,870
<i>Stop me if you've heard it</i>

67
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,918
<i>My skin is soapy and my hair is wet</i>

68
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,506
<i>And Tegrin spelled backward is nirget</i>

69
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,388
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart,
could I see you for a minute?

70
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,685
-What's up?
-Uh....

71
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,983
I've decided to pay a professional
musician to play here on Sundays.

72
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,404
Her name is Stephanie something.
Uh, she's supposed to be very good.

73
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,281
But what about Phoebe?

74
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:27,369
Rachel, uh,
it's not that your friend is bad.

75
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,455
It's that she's so bad...

76
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:36,628
...she makes me want to put my finger
through my eye into my brain...

77
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,588
...and swirl it around.

78
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,093
Okay, so you're not a fan.

79
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,763
But, I mean, come on.
You cannot do this to her.

80
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,390
Uh.

81
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,517
Oh, no, no, no.

82
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,435
-I have to do this to her?
-Mm-hm.

83
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,771
<i>Lather, rinse, repeat</i>

84
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,148
<i>And lather, rinse, repeat</i>

85
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,819
<i>And lather, rinse, repeat</i>

86
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,779
<i>As needed</i>

87
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,079
We didn't bring enough stuff.

88
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,748
Did you forget to pack
the baby's anvil?

89
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,001
I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.

90
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,254
It's a known fact
that women love babies, all right?

91
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,924
Women love guys who love babies.
It's the sensitive thing.

92
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,637
Aim him at that pack of babes.
Maybe one of them will break away.

93
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,766
Wait, forget them.
We got one. Hard left.

94
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,727
-Give me the baby.
-No, I got him.

95
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,186
Come on, seriously.

96
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,230
Oh, seriously, you want him?

97
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,316
Hello.

98
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,026
Hello.

99
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,653
Who is this little cutie-pie?

100
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,656
Well, don't think me immodest, but...

101
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,283
...me.

102
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,785
Want to smell him?

103
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,121
I assume we're talking
about the baby?

104
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,665
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.

105
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,127
He's got that great baby smell.
Get a whiff of his head.

106
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,214
My uterus just skipped a beat.

107
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,675
What'd I tell you?

108
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,385
It's great you're doing this.

109
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,930
Well, we are great guys.

110
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,058
My brother and his boyfriend
have been trying to adopt.

111
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,018
What agency did you two go through?

112
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,983
But this is my gig.

113
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,485
This is where I play.

114
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,363
My name is written out there in chalk.

115
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,157
You know, you can't just erase chalk.

116
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,912
Honey, I'm sorry.

117
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,373
And he's going to
be paying this woman?

118
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,459
Why doesn't he just give her
a throne and a crown?

119
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:44,756
And, like, you know, a gold stick
with a ball on top?

120
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:49,135
Terry is a jerk! That's why
we always say, "Terry's a jerk!"

121
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,055
That's where that came from.

122
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,349
Yeah, okay.

123
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,060
You probably did everything you could.

124
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,107
You know what? Let me just
see what else I can do.

125
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,901
All right, look, look.

126
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,071
Just let her go on after
Stephanie whatever her name is.

127
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,699
You won't be here.
You don't pay her.

128
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,575
I don't know.

129
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,703
I'll clean the cappuccino machine!

130
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,247
You don't clean
the cappuccino machine?

131
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,543
Of course I clean it.

132
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,587
I mean, I will clean it.

133
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,089
I mean, I will clean it.

134
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,551
All right, fine, fine, fine!

135
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,263
Oh.

136
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,890
-Done.
-Really?

137
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,642
Who's working for you, babe?

138
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,521
-Oh, my God! This is so exciting!
-I know.

139
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,064
How much am I gonna get?

140
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,607
What?

141
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,318
He's paying the people
who were playing.

142
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,029
Oh, no, no, no.

143
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,283
I meant, he's paying that other woman
because she's a professional.

144
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,661
I'm not gonna be the only one
who's not getting paid.

145
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,163
But, Pheebs-

146
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,622
Uh-uh, I'm sorry, no!

147
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,419
No, I'm not some sloppy second,
you know, charity band.

148
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,005
There are thousands of places
in this city...

149
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:10,091
...where people would pay
to hear me play.

150
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,177
<i>When I play, I play for me</i>

151
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,471
<i>/ don't need your charity</i>

152
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,930
Thank you!

153
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,358
I'm not getting a shot.
Maybe they can take the needle...

154
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,862
...and squirt it into my mouth.
Like a squirt gun.

155
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,449
Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.

156
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:38,620
I see someone's having
a little allergic reaction.

157
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,539
Doctor, can I see you
for just a moment?

158
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:47,170
My brother has
a slight phobia about needles.

159
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,339
Did you tell him
about my squirt gun idea?

160
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,219
My brother, the Ph.D.,
would like to know...

161
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,596
...if there's any way
to treat this orally?

162
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,847
No.

163
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:02,143
Under these circumstances, it has to be
an injection, and it has to be now.

164
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,604
So?

165
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,439
Oh.

166
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:10,819
Go and have a seat. Um, the doctor
says it's got to be a needle.

167
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:15,824
You're just going to have to be brave.
Can you do that for me?

168
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,451
-Okay.
-Okay.

169
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,454
Oh, boy! You are doing so good.

170
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,166
-You want to squeeze my hand?
-Yes.

171
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,378
Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

172
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,880
Honey, really.
Don't squeeze it so hard!

173
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,174
Let go of my hand!

174
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,055
Good plan. Next time
we want to pick up women...

175
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,141
...we should go to
the park and make out.

176
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,018
Taxi! Taxi!

177
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,065
Look at that talent.

178
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,902
Just practicing. You're good.

179
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,821
Carry on.

180
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,031
Wait, wait, wait!

181
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,535
Hey, you. He's just adorable.

182
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:05,039
Can you tell him that?
Because he thinks he looks too pink.

183
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,127
-What are you guys out doing today?
-We're not out.

184
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,254
No, no. No.

185
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,299
We're two heterosexual guys
hanging with the son...

186
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,177
...of our other heterosexual friend,
doing the usual straight-guy stuff.

187
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,265
-You done?
-Yeah.

188
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,850
Oh, there's our stop.

189
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,228
Get out of here!
This is our stop.

190
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,480
-You guys live around here too?
-Yeah, sure.

191
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,400
We live in the building
by the, uh, sidewalk.

192
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,862
You know it?

193
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:41,534
Ha, ha. Since we're neighbors, what do
you say we, uh, get together for a drink?

194
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,708
So, uh, you want to go to Markers?

195
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,127
Oh, sure, they love us over there.

196
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,046
Where's your baby?

197
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,596
Ben! Ben!

198
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,434
Ben! Ben!

199
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,563
That's good. Maybe he'll
hear you and pull the cord!

200
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,898
Stop the bus! Hey!

201
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,526
-Hey, there's a baby!
-Wait, wait, wait!

202
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,409
Are you sure he didn't break it?
It hurts.

203
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,995
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

204
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:30,750
And right here is
the puncture wound from your ring.

205
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,213
-I'm really sorry.
-It's okay.

206
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,506
Sorry.

207
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,468
Hmm, sorry! I got my S's back!
Ha, ha.

208
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,805
Which we can celebrate later.

209
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,516
Celebrate. Celebrate....

210
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,727
<i>He was a double, double</i>

211
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,563
<i>Double-jointed boy</i>

212
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,566
Hey.

213
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,611
So, um, are you the
professional guitar player?

214
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,697
Yeah, I'm Stephanie.

215
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:05,201
Oh, right. My name was on there,
but now it just says carrot cake.

216
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,662
Okay.

217
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,290
So, um,
how many chords do you know?

218
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,626
-All of them.
-So you know D?

219
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,921
-Yeah.
-Do you know A-minor?

220
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,757
-Yeah.
-Okay.

221
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,593
Do you know how to go
from D to A-minor?

222
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,597
-Yeah.
-Okay.

223
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,475
Um, so does your guitar have a strap?

224
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,645
-No.
-Oh.

225
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,980
Mine does.

226
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,986
<i>Stephanie knows all the chords</i>

227
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,198
Come on! Pick up, pick up!

228
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,742
Hello. Ahem.

229
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,827
Transit Authority? Yes, hello.

230
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,163
I'm doing research for a book.

231
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,167
I was wondering what somebody might
do if they left a baby on a city bus.

232
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,880
Yes, I realize that would be
a stupid character.

233
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,799
Here's the deal:
We lost a car seat on a bus.

234
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,594
It's white plastic and
it fits onto a stroller.

235
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,221
Oh, and there was a baby in it.

236
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,141
He wants to talk to you.

237
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,521
Everybody, let's give a warm
Central Perk welcome to—

238
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,524
<i>Terry's a jerk and he won't let me work</i>

239
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,651
<i>And I hate Central Perk</i>

240
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,450
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer!

241
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,327
Whoo!

242
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,043
I'd like to start with a song I wrote
for the first man I ever loved.

243
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,881
<i>Zachary-</i>

244
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,259
<i>Are all invited to bite me</i>

245
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:58,064
We're the guys that called
about the baby! Is he here?!

246
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,191
-He's here.
-Aah!

247
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,654
I assume one of you is the father.

248
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,030
-That's me.
-I'm him.

249
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,912
Actually, uh, ahem,
we're both the father.

250
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,298
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy.

251
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,141
Please tell me you know
which one is our baby.

252
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,020
That one has ducks on his T-shirt
and this one has clowns.

253
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,273
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

254
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,941
Or clowns.

255
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,402
Oh, wait.

256
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,822
That one's Ben! Remember he had
that cute little mole by his mouth!

257
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,073
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

258
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,284
Hey, Ben! Remember us?

259
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,995
Okay, the mole came off.

260
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,748
-What are we gonna do?
-Uh.

261
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,835
We'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.

262
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,129
-Flip for the baby?
-You got a better idea?

263
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,047
All right, call it in the air.

264
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,842
Heads.

265
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,385
-Heads, it is.
-Yes.

266
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,223
We have to assign heads
to something!

267
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,685
Right! Okay.

268
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,353
Okay, uh....

269
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,816
Ducks is heads
because ducks have heads.

270
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,282
What kind of scary-ass clowns
came to your birthday?

271
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:43,628
<i>Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel</i>

272
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:48,633
<i>Just touch my cheek
Before you leave me, baby</i>

273
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,221
<i>Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel</i>

274
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,642
<i>Then slowly turn away</i>

275
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,687
<i>/ won't beg you to stay</i>

276
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,523
<i>With me</i>

277
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,700
-Hey
-Oh, hi.

278
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,662
Here. I thought you might be cold.

279
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,538
Thank you.

280
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,333
Oh.

281
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,547
Oh, look at you!
You did pretty well.

282
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,842
$8.27.

283
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,512
But not really, because
I put in the first two.

284
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,434
Just to get the ball rolling
and to make myself feel better.

285
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,811
Do you?

286
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,437
No.

287
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,900
You know, this whole playing
for money thing is so not good for me.

288
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,654
I don't know, when I
sang "Su-su-suicide"...

289
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,575
...I got, like, $1.75.

290
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,911
But then "Smelly Cat"? Oh.

291
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,958
I got 25 cents and a condom.

292
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:09,171
So, you know, now I just feel
really bad for "Smelly Cat."

293
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,549
Well, you know.

294
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,886
Honey, I don't think
everybody gets "Smelly Cat."

295
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:22,184
I mean, if all you've ever actually
had are healthy pets, then whoosh!

296
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,479
But it's not even that, you know?

297
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,524
I used to do my songs
because it made me happy.

298
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:32,695
Now it's just all
about the money, you know?

299
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,491
Well, people missed you in there.

300
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,911
In fact, there was actually
a request for "Smelly Cat."

301
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,788
Really? From who?

302
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,665
Well, me.

303
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,463
And I know it's not your big
money song, but it's my favorite.

304
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,550
Hi.

305
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,178
Uh. Did I accidentally drop
a condom in your case?

306
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,434
It's kind of an emergency.

307
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,061
Yeah.

308
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,771
-Here you go.
-Thanks a lot.

309
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,231
Hey, Christine! I got it!

310
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,366
I want to thank you
for being there for me.

311
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,951
And I'm sorry
I almost broke your hand. Ha, ha.

312
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,246
That's okay.
I'm sorry I poisoned you.

313
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,706
Mm.

314
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,168
Remember the time I jammed
that pencil into your hand?

315
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:33,130
Remember it? What do
you think this is, a freckle?

316
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,590
Oh.

317
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,594
What about the time I hit you
in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?

318
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,180
Remember when I stuck
that broom in your spokes...

319
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,891
...and you hit your head on the curb?

320
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,309
No.

321
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,144
But I remember
people telling me about it.

322
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,729
Oh.

323
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,732
I hope Ben has a little sister.

324
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,317
Yeah.

325
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,528
And I hope she can kick his ass.

326
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,864
I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.

327
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,827
How about the time I cut
the legs off your Malibu Ken?

328
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,912
That was you?

329
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,206
Uh.

330
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:10,501
They were infected.
He wouldn't have made it.

331
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,422
Aw.

332
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,006
My little nephew.

333
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,925
Come here, little one!

334
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,388
Oh. There's my little baby, Ben!

335
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,015
Hey, my little boy. Oh.

336
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,019
Hey, he's not crying!

337
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,733
Hey, he's not crying!

338
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,864
Yes.

339
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,284
There's still pie! Ha-ha-ha.

340
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,537
I'm here. I'm here.

341
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,123
Uh. How's my little boy, huh?

342
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,753
You want Daddy to change
your diaper? I know, I know.

343
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,048
Did you have fun with, uh, Uncle Joey
and Uncle Chandler today?

344
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,300
Oh, yeah.

345
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,844
-He rode the bus today.
-Ooh.

346
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,347
Well.

347
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,517
Big boy riding the bus-

348
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,020
Hey, I have a question.

349
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,734
How come it says,
"Property of Human Services"?

350
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,863
You....

351
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,240
You are gonna love this.

352
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,494
Can you hold Ben for a sec?

353
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,412
Come here. Come here.

354
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,665
Stay back! I've got kiwi!
Run, Joey, run!

355
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,966
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

356
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,552
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

357
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,554
No, no. I'm sorry, it's, ahem:

358
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,724
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

359
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,815
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

360
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,609
-Better!
-Yeah?

361
00:21:58,776 --> 00:21:59,860
Much better. Good.

362
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,655
Don't feel bad,
because it's a hard song.

363
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,114
Yeah.

364
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,535
-You want to try it again?
-From the top?

365
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,787
There is no "top," all right?

366
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,873
That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat."

367
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,211
Um. Ahem.
Why don't you just follow me?

368
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,921
-Okay.
-Mm-hm.

369
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,716

That's too much. Sorry.
