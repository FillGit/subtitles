1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:11,094
Okay, these were expensive,
and he's gonna grow out of them...

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,972
...in 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist!

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,974
Aww!

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,937
Look at these.

5
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,146
Hey, Ben.

6
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,065
"Just do it"! Unh!

7
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,777
Oh, my God! Oh!

8
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,737
Was that too much pressure for him?

9
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:34,534
-Oh, is he hungry already? Aw.
-I guess so.

10
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,411
You know, it's....

11
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,459
Something funny about sneakers.
I'll be right back.

12
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,379
Oh, uh, I gotta get one too.

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,967
Hey, what are you guys doing?

14
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,678
We're just hanging out
by the spoons.

15
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,763
Ladle?

16
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,181
Will you guys grow up?

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,184
This is the most natural,
beautiful thing in the world.

18
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:02,396
Yeah, we know.
But there's a baby sucking on it.

19
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:09,945
This is my son having lunch, okay?
It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.

20
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:13,657
If you have a problem, if you're
uncomfortable, just ask questions.

21
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,493
Carol's fine with it. Come on.

22
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,622
-Carol?
-Carol.

23
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,919
I was wondering if Joey could ask you
a question about breast-feeding?

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,924
-Sure.
-Uh....

25
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,343
Does it hurt?

26
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,097
It did at first, but not anymore.

27
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,557
Chandler?

28
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,437
So, uh, how often can you do it?

29
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,480
As much as he needs.

30
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,568
Oh, okay, I got one, I got one. Uh....

31
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,197
If he blows into one,
does the other one get bigger?

32
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,626
-Rachel, do you have muffins left?
-Yeah, I forget which ones.

33
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,836
Oh, you're busy, I'll get it.

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,588
-Anyone else want one?
-No, thanks.

35
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:52,964
No, I'm all set.

36
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,133
Oh, you're losing your apron.
Let me get it.

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,802
-Oh.
-There you go.

38
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,303
Thank you.

39
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,057
Ugh, what a bitch.

40
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,271
Listen, guys, I have a friend
at Bloomingdale's who's quitting...

41
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,524
...and he wants to abuse his discount.

42
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,360
So anyone want to come
take advantage of it?

43
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,238
I can't. I have to take
my grandmother to the vet.

44
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,994
-Okay. Um, I'll go with you.
-Great.

45
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,374
-Hi, honey.
-Hey, sweetums.

46
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,086
-And hello to the rest.
-Hi.

47
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,548
What are you doing?

48
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,092
You can't go shopping with her.
What about Rachel?

49
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,053
-It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
-Come on.

50
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,139
You're going to
Bloomingdale's with Julie.

51
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,308
It's like cheating on Rachel
in her house of worship.

52
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,437
-But I-
-Monica, she will kill you.

53
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,774
She will kill you
like a dog in the street!

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,949
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys
are going shopping tomorrow.

55
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,453
Yeah, urn, it's actually not that big a deal.
In fact-

56
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,748
It's a big deal to me. This is great.
I really appreciate this.

57
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,500
You're welcome.

58
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,600
Bijan for men?

59
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,311
Bijan for men?

60
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,229
Bijan for men?

61
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,691
-Hey, Annabel.
-Hey, Joey.

62
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,110
-Did you hear about the new guy?
-Who?

63
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,615
Nobody knows his name. Me and
the girls call him "The Hombre Man."

64
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,542
Hombre?

65
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,674
What's he doing in my section?

66
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,593
I guess he doesn't know.

67
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,386
Well, he's gonna.

68
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,556
I'll see you a little later, okay?

69
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,353
Hey, how you doing?

70
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,605
Morning.

71
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,815
Listen, uh, heh. I know you're new...

72
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,152
...but, uh, it's kind of
understood that everything...

73
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,822
...from young men's to
the escalator is, uh, my territory.

74
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,576
-Your territory, huh?
-Yeah.

75
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,663
-Bijan for men?
-No, thanks.

76
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,331
Hombre?

77
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,667
Yeah, all right.

78
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,508
You were saying?

79
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,558
Phoebe, listen. You were with me,
and we were shopping all day.

80
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,102
-What?
-We were shopping and we had lunch.

81
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,145
All right. What did I have?

82
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,440
-You had a salad.
-No wonder I don't feel full.

83
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,901
Hi, guys. What's up?

84
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,988
I went shopping with Monica all day
and I had a salad.

85
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,576
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?

86
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,827
Urn....

87
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,413
We went shopping for, urn....

88
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,039
For, urn....

89
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,208
For fur.

90
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,839
-You went shopping for fur?
-Yeah.

91
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:25,302
And then I realized
that I'm against that and, urn....

92
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,721
So then we bought some, urn....

93
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,223
Um, boobs.

94
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,148
You bought boobs?

95
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,860
Bras!

96
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,820
We bought bras!

97
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,032
We bought bras.

98
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,745
Bijan for men?

99
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,622
Bijan for men?

100
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,582
Bijan for....

101
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,418
Hey, Annabel. Uh-

102
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,672
Listen, I was wondering if after work
we could grab a cup of coffee?

103
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,258
Actually, I sort of have plans.

104
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,635
Oh.

105
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,098
You ready, Annabel?

106
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,851
You bet.

107
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,189
-Maybe some other time.
-Yeah.

108
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,702
It's not the first time I lost a girl
to a cowboy spraying cologne.

109
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,412
Bijan for men?

110
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,498
Bijan for men!

111
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,960
Okay, and this is Funny Clown.

112
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,755
Funny Clown is only for after his naps,
not before or he won't sleep.

113
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,384
We've been through this before.
We have a good time.

114
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,845
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.

115
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,767
Honey, relax.
Ross is great with him.

116
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:59,854
Don't look so surprised.
I'm a lovely person.

117
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,733
Oh, this is so cute.

118
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,527
Ah, I got that for him!

119
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,362
"My Mommies Love Me."

120
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,409
That's clever.

121
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,245
Hello?

122
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,122
Oh, hi, Jul....

123
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,999
Hi, Jew!

124
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,336
Uh-huh.

125
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,214
Uh-huh. Okay, um, sure.

126
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,384
That'd be great. See you then. Bye.

127
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,803
Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?

128
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,268
Yes. Um, yes, I did.

129
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,645
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

130
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,694
Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.

131
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,326
Ben, dinner!

132
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,662
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

133
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,458
You didn't microwave that, did you?
It's breast milk, you're not supposed to.

134
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,502
Duh, I think I know
how to heat breast milk. Heh.

135
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,464
Okay.

136
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,467
What did you just do?

137
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,427
I licked my arm, what?

138
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,929
It's breast milk!

139
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,347
So?

140
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:20,602
Phoebe, that is juice
squeezed from a person.

141
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,230
-What is the big deal?
-No, no--

142
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,442
What did you just do?

143
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,906
Can people stop
drinking the breast milk?

144
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,327
-You won't even taste it?
-No.

145
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,704
Not even if you just
pretend it's milk?

146
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,208
Not even if Carol's breast had
a picture of a missing child on it.

147
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,883
-Hey.
-Hi.

148
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,385
-Where is everybody?
-Took Ben to the park.

149
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,930
-Where have you been?
-Just out.

150
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:01,392
Had some lunch. Just me.
A little quality time with me.

151
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,146
-Hey, thanks for your jacket.
-Oh, no problem.

152
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,565
-You can borrow it, by the way.
-Heh.

153
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,236
-Oh, here are your keys, honey.
-Thank you.

154
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,489
-Mon?
-Mm-hmm?

155
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,493
If, uh, you were at lunch alone,
how come it cost you $53?

156
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,082
You know what probably happened?

157
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,168
-Someone must have stolen my credit card.
-Ah.

158
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,338
And put the receipt
back in your pocket?

159
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:34,801
Huh. That is an excellent,
excellent question.

160
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,678
That is excellent.

161
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,890
What's with you?
Who did you have lunch with?

162
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,475
-Judy.
-Who?

163
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,145
-Julie. Jody?
-What?

164
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,525
-You were with Julie?
-Mm. Look.

165
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,319
When it started,
I was just trying to be nice to her...

166
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,364
...because she was
my brother's girlfriend.

167
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,742
And then one thing led to another...

168
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,787
...and before I knew it, we were...

169
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,331
-...shopping.
-Aah.

170
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,337
Oh, my God.

171
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,716
Wait, we only did it once.

172
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,511
It didn't mean anything to me.

173
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,806
-Yeah, right. Sure.
-Really!

174
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,851
Rachel,
I was thinking of you the whole time.

175
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:32,108
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I never meant for you to find out.

176
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,987
Oh, please! Please!
You wanted to get caught!

177
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,697
That is not true!

178
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,325
So you just happened
to leave it in here?

179
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,121
Did it ever occur to you
that I might just be that stupid?

180
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,334
Okay, Monica,
I just have to know one thing.

181
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,173
Did you go with her
to Bloomingdale's?

182
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,977
Okay. Okay.

183
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:13,233
Okay, I just really, um-
I just need to not be with you right now.

184
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,118
Hi, who's this?

185
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,455
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica.

186
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,833
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

187
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,920
Joanne, it's not as simple
as all that, okay?

188
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,841
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
Hi, Steve.

189
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,180
-Hey!
-Hi!

190
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,932
How did we do?

191
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,810
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk
and Ross freaked out.

192
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,853
I— I did not freak out.

193
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,148
-Why'd you freak out?
-Because it's breast milk.

194
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,943
It's gross!

195
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,653
My breast milk is gross?

196
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,490
This should be fun.

197
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,369
No, Carol.
There's nothing wrong with it.

198
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,164
I just don't think
breast milk is for adults.

199
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,710
Of course, the packaging does
appeal to grownups and kids.

200
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,923
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it.
It's no big deal.

201
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,551
-Come on, just taste it.
-Ha-ha-ha.

202
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,553
That would be no.

203
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,513
-Come on.
-Try it.

204
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,307
-It's natural.
-It doesn't taste bad.

205
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,394
Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.
Sort of like, uh....

206
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,688
-Like what?
-Cantaloupe juice.

207
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,398
Exactly.

208
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,990
You've tasted it.

209
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,200
You've tasted it.

210
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,660
Uh-huh.

211
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,246
Oh, you've tasted it.

212
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,376
You can keep saying it,
but it won't stop being true.

213
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,635
Give me the bottle.

214
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,934
Get me the towel.

215
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,084
Howdy.

216
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,463
Give me a box of juice.

217
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,134
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

218
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,388
Maybe it's because of
the way you're dressed.

219
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,518
Or maybe this guy's doing so good
they want to put more people on it.

220
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,979
This guy goes through
two bottles a day now.

221
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,691
What do you care?

222
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,862
You're an actor. This is your day job.
Isn't supposed to mean anything.

223
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,573
I know, but I was the best.

224
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,910
You know? I liked being the best.

225
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,333
Maybe I should get
out of the game.

226
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,670
They need guys up in housewares
to serve cheese.

227
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,713
Say you do that.

228
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,968
Sooner or later, somebody will come
along that slices a better cheddar.

229
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,596
And then where you gonna run?

230
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,807
-I guess you're right.
-Damn right I'm right.

231
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,518
Show this guy what you're made of.
Stand your ground.

232
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:40,189
Show him that you're the baddest
Hombre west of the lingerie!

233
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,984
-I'm gonna do it!
-All right!

234
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,822
Now, go see Miss Kitty and
she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

235
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,701
I don't know what to say.

236
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,203
That works good
because I'm not listening.

237
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,789
I feel terrible. I really do.

238
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,208
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did my back hurt your knife?

239
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,627
Rachel!

240
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,922
Say that I'm friends with her.
We spend time together.

241
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,175
-Is that so terrible?
-Yes.

242
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,927
-It's that terrible?
-Yes, Monica! You don't get it.

243
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,804
It's bad enough she stole the guy...

244
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,557
...who may be the person
I'm supposed to be with.

245
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,058
But now...

246
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,936
...she's actually....

247
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,565
But now she's actually stealing you!

248
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,985
Me?

249
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,112
What are you talking about?

250
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,740
Nobody could steal me from you.

251
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,410
Because I'm friends with her doesn't
make me any less friends with you.

252
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,621
Honey.

253
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,081
I mean, you're my....

254
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,959
And we're....

255
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,340
-Oh, I love you!
-I love you too!

256
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,806
You guys, um, I know that this really
doesn't have anything to do with me.

257
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,518
But, urn, I love you guys too!

258
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,651
Ugh, I really needed that.

259
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,530
Look, I know you're in a place
right now...

260
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,282
...where you really need
to hate Julie's guts.

261
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,327
But she didn't do anything wrong.

262
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,957
She's just a girl who met a guy,
and now they go out.

263
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,627
I think that if you gave her
a chance, you'd like her.

264
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,798
Will you give that a chance?

265
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,925
For me?

266
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,388
I'd do anything for you,
you know that.

267
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,932
I'd do anything for you!

268
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,561
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

269
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,289
Morning.

270
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,876
Heh. I said, morning.

271
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,546
I heard you.

272
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,301
All right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.

273
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,760
You boys ready?

274
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,600
Ready.

275
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,227
Yeah, I'm ready.

276
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,276
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

277
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,654
You've blinded me! I'm suing!

278
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,532
Oh, my God! Todd!
What the hell did you do?

279
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,534
I'm sorry. I'm such a doofus!

280
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,079
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

281
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,082
My God, what happened?

282
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,460
Eh, these new kids, they never last.

283
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,004
Sooner or later they all...

284
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,423
...stop lasting.

285
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,178
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you
that cup of coffee now?

286
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,930
Sure.

287
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,986
-So.
-So.

288
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,243
I just thought the two of us
should hang out a bit.

289
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,204
I mean, you know,
we've never really talked.

290
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,624
I guess you'd know that,
being one of the two of us. Ha, ha, right?

291
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,793
-I know.
-Mm.

292
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,296
I probably shouldn't
even tell you this...

293
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,633
...but I'm pretty much
totally intimidated by you.

294
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,137
Really? Me?

295
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,180
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

296
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,182
Ross is so crazy about you...

297
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,602
...and I really wanted you
to like me, and I....

298
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,605
It's probably me just
being totally paranoid...

299
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,317
...but I kind of got the feeling
that maybe you don't.

300
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,784
Well...

301
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,495
...you're not totally paranoid.

302
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,416
-Oy.
-Um.

303
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,628
Okay. Urn....

304
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,424
-God. Urn....
-Heh.

305
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,595
When you and, uh,
Ross first started going out...

306
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,223
...it was really hard for me, um...

307
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:12,438
...for many reasons of which I'm not
gonna bore you with now, but, um....

308
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,654
I see how happy he is
and how good you guys are together.

309
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,868
And, um, Monica's always
saying how nice you are...

310
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,370
...and God, I hate it when she's right.

311
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,291
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

312
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,170
Listen. Would you like to go to
a movie sometime or something?

313
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:39,298
-Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
-Yeah?

314
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,967
-I'd love it too. Okay.
-Okay.

315
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,719
-Oh, shoot, I gotta go.
-Okay.

316
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,013
-So I'll talk to you later.
