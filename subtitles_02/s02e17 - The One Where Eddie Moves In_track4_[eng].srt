1
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:08,467
Huh? So, what do you think?

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,844
Casa de Joey.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,096
Huh? I decorated it myself.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,973
-Get out.
-No.

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,143
Wow, Joey, this is, uh....

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,145
-Art.
-Art it is.

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,733
Well, check this out.
Is it a coffee table?

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,195
Is it, uh, a panther?
There's no need to decide.

9
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,199
Hey, nice pillow.

10
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,244
So tell me,
is this genuine Muppet skin?

11
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,414
Hey, excellent water-table thing.

12
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,875
Thanks. I love this.
But you know what?

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,211
It makes me want to pee.

14
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,006
Yeah, me too.
I think that's the challenge. Heh.

15
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,636
Hey, how come, uh,
Chandler didn't come?

16
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,723
Well, uh, it's because he had
a thing with the-

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,058
With the thing.

18
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,187
Right. I got it.

19
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,649
Why don't you show us
the rest of your casa?

20
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:06,900
Yeah.

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,070
Uh, oh, oh, the best part. Come on.

22
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,825
Huh?

23
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,661
Hey.

24
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,706
Nice toilet.

25
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,624
No, no, no. Behind it.

26
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,544
-You have a phone in here?
-That's right.

27
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,004
I have a phone.

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,131
In here.

29
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,050
-Joey, promise me something.
-Yeah.

30
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,469
Never call me from that phone.

31
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,907
Okay, here we go.

32
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:42,371
Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.
Someone just got the last piece.

33
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,416
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You are not gonna believe this.

34
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,461
I have just been discovered.

35
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,549
Wait a minute. I claimed you
in the name of France four years ago.

36
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,388
Anyway.

37
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:03,308
Promise you won't freak out
and say how great this is until I'm done.

38
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,559
-Okay.
-Okay.

39
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,938
Uh, I just met this producer
of this teeny record company...

40
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,108
...who said, ahem, that I have
a very fresh, offbeat sound...

41
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,653
...and she wants to do
a demo of "Smelly Cat."

42
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,824
Okay, I told you not to do that yet.
Ha, ha.

43
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,367
Okay.

44
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,953
And she wants to do a video.

45
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,832
I'm not done yet, okay? Ha, ha.

46
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,459
God. Okay.

47
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,714
If that goes well,
they may even want to make an album.

48
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,802
-I'm done now.
-Oh, that's great.

49
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,304
That's unbelievable. Oh.

50
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,891
Oh, God, Ross, if you care about me,
get the pie out of the man's hood.

51
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,853
-Get the what?
-There's a pie in the hood. Go.

52
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:59,114
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry. My pie was in your hood.

53
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,327
I have to get the coffee
out of that guy's pants...

54
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,038
...and I'll be back
in the hospital by 7.

55
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,547
Damn it, Ross.
Get your butt out of the bathroom.

56
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,759
Calm down. I'm blow-drying.

57
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,305
Blow-drying what?
You have no hair.

58
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,849
What's going on?

59
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,560
Uh, your boyfriend has been
in there for an hour.

60
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,645
It's like I'm living with him again.

61
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,899
He's here when I go to sleep,
when I wake up, when I wanna shower.

62
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,651
Uh, I feel like I'm 16 again.

63
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,738
Well, you're not 16.
You're both adults now.

64
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,948
Get out, you doofus!

65
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,788
Or, you know,
he's rubber and you're glue.

66
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,709
All yours.

67
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,629
I hope you cleaned your hair
out of the drain.

68
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,757
I hope you cleaned your hair
out of the drain.

69
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,926
-Shut up.
-Shut up.

70
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,511
Cut it out.

71
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,186
I've never wanted you more.

72
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,658
So, what do you say, boys?
Should I call him?

73
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,749
You know what they say:

74
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,085
Ask your slippers a question...

75
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,672
...you're going crazy.

76
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,303
-Hello?
-<i>Hey.</i>

77
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,555
Hey.

78
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,266
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't make it
over there today.

79
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,642
Oh, that's okay.

80
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,395
You, uh- You had a thing.

81
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,897
Yeah, well,
I hear the place looks great.

82
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,651
Oh, forget about it.
I'm having a ball, ha.

83
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,611
How's the apartment doing?

84
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,282
Oh, hey, it's terrific.
I mean, it's a regular space...

85
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,493
...fest.

86
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,830
Oh, well, great.

87
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,081
<i>Yeah, I just...</i>

88
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,917
...wanted to call and say hey.

89
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,503
Well, okay, then.

90
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,423
Was that the oven timer?

91
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,466
That's right, my friend.

92
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,761
<i>-It's time for </i>Baywatch!
<i>-Baywatch!</i>

93
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,724
<i>Oh.</i>

94
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,310
Can you believe they gave
Stephanie skin cancer?

95
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,062
I can't believe
they promoted her to lieutenant.

96
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,400
You're saying that because
you love Yasmine Bleeth.

97
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,612
How could anyone
not love Yasmine Bleeth?

98
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,990
Hey. Hey, they're running.

99
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,202
See, this is the brilliance of the show.

100
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,330
I say always keep them running.

101
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,625
All the time running.

102
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,793
Run.

103
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,670
Run.

104
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,465
Run, Yasmine. Run like the wind.

105
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,385
But you wanted to live by yourself.

106
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,305
I did. I thought it'd be great.

107
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,683
I figured I'd have time alone
with my thoughts.

108
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,437
But it turns out I don't have
as many thoughts as you'd think.

109
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,942
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler
about moving back?

110
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,069
You really think he'd take me?

111
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,237
We had a good talk last night...

112
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,698
...but when I moved out,
I hurt him bad.

113
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,493
I promise you,
he would definitely want you back.

114
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,037
I'm telling you,
there's no way he's moving back.

115
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,500
But we had one of the greatest talks
we ever had last night. Heh.

116
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,377
I mean, it was-

117
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,630
It was like when we first
started living together.

118
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,841
Look, I know you don't want
to hear this right now...

119
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,012
...but we've seen him
in his new place. And he's happy.

120
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,265
He's decorated.

121
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:59,229
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, okay?
You have to, too.

122
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:03,149
No, you're just gonna have to accept
the fact that you're just friends now.

123
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,776
You're not...

124
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,653
...roommates anymore.

125
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,740
Okay, Phoebe. Ready to try one?

126
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,742
Okay. Ahem.

127
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,580
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

128
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,542
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

129
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,711
<i>Smelly, smelly, smelly</i>

130
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,212
<i>Really bad smelling smelly cat</i>

131
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,588
Oh, whoa! Oh, my God!

132
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,885
I mean, like, who was that?

133
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,099
They're your backup singers.
Behind you, hon.

134
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,851
Oh.

135
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,770
Oh, I thought
they were just watching me.

136
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,607
-Like at an aquarium, you know?
-All right.

137
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,695
-From the top.
-Okay. Ahem.

138
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,073
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

139
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,035
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,745
<i>Smelly, smelly, smelly</i>

00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,621
<i>Really bad smelling smelly cat</i>

142
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,248
<i>It's not your fault</i>

143
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,499
Okay, sorry.

144
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,334
I'm just not getting...

145
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,837
...that everyone, um, gets...

146
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,299
...how smelly this cat actually is.

147
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,384
Maybe if we could talk about this...

148
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,180
...because I need to feel
that you really care about the cat.

149
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,433
Honey, we can talk about this.

150
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,686
It's just that it's costing
about $100 a minute to be in here.

151
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,606
Oh, okay. So, um, the cat stinks,
but you love it. Let's go.

152
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:30,111
No, there is no way
he was a velociraptor.

153
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,238
Look at the cranial ridge, okay?

154
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,825
If Dino was a velociraptor,
he'd have eaten the Flintstones.

155
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,244
Yeah. Yeah.

156
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,038
Oh, were you taking a nap?

157
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,040
-I was.
-Oh, I-

158
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,959
Oh, wait, Tony, can you hold on?
That's the other line.

159
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,252
Hello?

160
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,464
Yeah, she's here,
but, uh, can she call you back?

161
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,174
Okay, thanks.

162
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,509
Call Joanna. Hi.

163
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,885
Did she leave a number?

164
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,387
Did you see me write one down?

165
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,933
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

166
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,270
Well, she'll call back.
Don't be such a baby.

167
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,814
I'm not a baby. You're the baby.

168
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,316
-Look, you wanna get off my back?
-Get out of my face.

169
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,194
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

170
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,112
Hello?

171
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,656
Hi.

172
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,534
Yeah, no, she's right here.
Um, hold on.

173
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,786
Hi, Tony, can I call you back?

174
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,622
That's, uh-
That's my sister's boyfriend.

175
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,499
Give me that.

176
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,501
Okay.

177
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:31,798
Sweetie, before I forget, did I leave
my diaphragm at your place?

178
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,260
Hi, Mom.

179
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,278
Hey. Yeah, ha, ha.

180
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,284
So, uh, how's the palace?

181
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,997
It's funny you should mention that
because I was thinking....

182
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,832
What's with the boxes?

183
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,420
Oh, uh, actually,
I, uh, have some news.

184
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,424
Is that Joey guy gonna pick up
his moose hat or should I toss it?

185
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,345
Why don't you ask him yourself?
This is my new roommate, Eddie.

186
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,680
Nice to meet you.

187
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,724
-Likewise.
-How you doing?

188
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,225
Uh, I'll take that.

189
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,687
It's, uh, what I came for, heh.

190
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,274
So this is new.
Where'd you two meet?

191
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:35,194
At the, uh, supermarket
in the, uh, ethnic-food section.

192
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,405
I helped him pick out a chorizo. Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.

193
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,866
-It's a— I mean....
-Wow.

194
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:44,162
We got to talking. And, uh, he needed
a place, and I had a spare room.

195
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,789
Oh, now it's a spare room?

196
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,958
Well, yeah.
In that it's not being used...

197
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,210
...and I have it to spare.

198
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,587
Right.

199
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,883
Well, I, uh, got what I came for.

200
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,721
I'll, uh- I'll see you guys.

201
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,141
Hey, Joe.

202
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,976
When'd you start using
moose in your hair?

203
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,564
Is this guy great, or what?

204
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,650
Yeah.

205
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,401
Yeah, he is.

206
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,245
I can't believe he has
a new roommate. Who is this guy?

207
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,205
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.

208
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:31,209
It'll never last.
He's just a rebound roommate.

209
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,920
-Hey.
-Hey.

210
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,839
Ooh, check it out. Oh, check it out.

211
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,635
-It's "Smelly Cat," the video.
-Oh, God.

212
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:45,890
Now, okay, I haven't seen it yet,
so if you don't like it...

213
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,685
...so what?
None of you ever made a video.

214
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,023
Okay.

215
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,904
<i>Get out of here, cat! You stink!</i>

216
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,957
-Oh, smoking.
-Oh, look at me.

217
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,835
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

218
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,547
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

219
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,384
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

220
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,346
<i>It's not your fault</i>

221
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,726
<i>Smelly, smelly, smelly</i>

222
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,854
<i>Really bad smelling smelly cat
It's not your fault</i>

223
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,857
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

224
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,192
-Oh, my God!
-I know.

225
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,403
I sound amazing!

226
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,200
<i>They won't take you to the vet</i>

227
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,661
<i>You're obviously not their favorite pet</i>

228

00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,544
<i>Oh, no</i>

231
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,130
I've never heard myself sing before.

232
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,008
I mean, except in my own head. Oh.

233
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,053
This is so cool.
Now I can hear what you hear.

234
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,931
Pretty, uh, different, huh?

235
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,852
Oh, I am sorry,
but I'm incredibly talented.

236

<i>It's not your fault</i>

238
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,538
Hey, Joey. What's going on, man?

239
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,082
Eddie.

240
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,417
-Morning.
-Morning.

241
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,754
I just, uh, came by to pick up my mail.

242
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,466
-Where's the mail?
-Oh, it's, uh, over there on the table.

243
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,219
You don't keep it
on this table anymore?

244
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,096
No, Eddie likes it over there.

245
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,895
All right, here you go, my friend.
Eggs a la Eddie, huh.

246
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,523
Ooh. Ooh.

247
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,693
Oh, oh. That's great.

248
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,362
Huh.

249
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,072
What?

250
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,157
I thought you liked your eggs...

251
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,661
...with the bread with the hole
in the middle, a la me.

252
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,832
I do, but, uh, Eddie makes them this way.
They're pretty darn good.

253
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,291
Well, you guys...

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,627
...I'm out of here.

255
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,420
See you, pals.

256
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,089
See you.

257
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,262
-So how are you two getting along?
-Oh, I couldn't be happier.

258
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,972
Great, huh?

259
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,224
I'm happy for you.

260
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,562
All right, that's it!

261
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:42,608
He just comes in here,
Mr. Johnny New Eggs...

262
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,737
...with his moving the mail and his:

263
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,906
"See you, pals."

264
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,202
And now there's no juice!

265
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,706
There's no juice for the people
who need the juice. I need the juice!

266
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,251
There's another carton
right over there.

267
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,964
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore,
all right, man?

268
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,340
All right.

269
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,633
So, what's it about?

270
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,760
Eggs.

271
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,638
Whose eggs do you like better,
his or mine, huh?

272
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,558
-Well, I like both eggs equally.
-Oh, come on!

273
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,102
Nobody likes
two kinds of eggs equally.

274
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,438
You like one better,
and I wanna know which.

275
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,316
What's the difference?
Your eggs aren't here anymore.

276
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,486
You took your eggs, and you left!

277
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,448
Did you really expect me
to never find new eggs?

278
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,702
I wanna watch <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

279
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,497
Tough. We're watching
<i>Predators of the Serengeti.</i>

280
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,999
-Ugh.
-Would you guys stop?

281
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,126
-It's my TV!
-What?

282
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,544
-Quit it.
-Bite me!

283
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,795
Oh, my God.

284
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,964
Well, Monica keeps changing
the channel.

285
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,593
Aw, that's great.
Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

286
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,888
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

287
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,724
Look, I refuse to get sucked into...

288
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,644
...this weird little Geller
dimension thing, okay?

289
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,688
So I'm gonna go take
a nice long hot bubble bath...

290
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,025
...because you kids
are driving me crazy!

291
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,321
What do we do about this?

292
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,531
We could tape <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

293
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,783
Not that!

294
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,701
This! Us!

295
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,496
Oh, my God, Ross, it's- You're just-

296
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,249
-Since you've been here, you're driving-
-Ow, ow.

297
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,669
Mon, you've gone ultrasonic
again, all right?

298
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,089
I just can't stand you being here...

299
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,507
...all the time!

300
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,802
Why? Why can't you
stand me being here?

301
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,345
We're just having fun.

302
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,181
Fun? You think this is fun?

303
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,432
Yeah.

304
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,019
I thought we were fooling around,
like when, uh- When we were kids.

305
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,105
I hated you when we were kids.

306
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,067
-You hated me when we were kids?
-Yes.

307
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,485
I hated you.

308
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,238
I loved you in a you're-my-brother-
so-l-have-to way...

309
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,407
...but basically, I hated your guts.

310
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,201
Why did you hate me?

311
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,246
Because you were mean to me...

312
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,874
...and you teased me
and you always got your way.

313
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,253
That wasn't fun for you?

314
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,256
Uh-huh.

315
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,467
I can't believe you hated me.

316
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,179
But now I love you.

317
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,267
And not just because I have to.

318
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,727
Really?

319
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,395
Yeah.

320
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:28,232
You're just gonna have
to stop pissing me off.

321
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,155
I can do that.

322
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,158
-Then I won't have to kill you.
-Ha, ha.

323
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,122
So you wanna watch, uh,
<i>Entertainment Tonight?</i>

324
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,166
Yeah, thanks.

325
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,335
<i>Tonight, America's premier
sports magazine...</i>

326
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,627
<i>...moves to primetime....</i>

327
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,588
-You know what?
-What?

328
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,716
If you really wanna watch
that Serengeti thing, we can.

329
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,052
Oh, okay.

330
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,435
-Hey.
-Hey.

331
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,229
Listen, you are not
going to believe this...

332
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,858
...but, ahem, that is not me
singing on the video.

333
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,527
No.

334
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,112
Yes.

335
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,781
Well, how did you find out?

336
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:21,327
The record company sent this paper
for me to sign saying it's okay...

337
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,289
...for someone else to sing for me.
That was my first clue.

338
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,375
So, what are you gonna do?

339
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,086
I can't work with people
who would do this.

340
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,462
Sure.

341
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,172
I mean, this poor woman.

342
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,341
What woman?

343
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,717
The voice woman.

344
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,887
She has a great voice,
but she doesn't have a video.

345
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,807
Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?

346
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,975
I have a video. Pay attention.

347
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,023
No, this voice woman,
she's so talented.

348
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,651
But according to the producer people...

349
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:57,530
...they said, like, she doesn't have
the right look or something. You know?

350
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,949
She's like one of those
animals at the pound...

351
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,368
...who nobody wants
because they're not pretty.

352
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,956
Or, you know, like some old dog
who's kind of like stinky and-

353
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,208
Oh, my God! She's smelly cat!

354
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,713
Oh, oh, that song has so many levels.

355
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,551
Hey, Eddie.

356
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,594
You, uh, wanna play some foosball?

357
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,514
No, thanks, man.
I'm not, uh- Not really into sports.

358
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,729
Yeah, okay. All right.

359
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,775
Doesn't matter. Time for <i>Baywatch.</i>

360
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,777
Oh, what?

361
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,863
You like that show?

362
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,616
You don't?

363
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,618
Ha, ha, what-? No.

364
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,705
I mean, it's just pretty people
running around on the beach.

365
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,458
Well, that's the brilliance of it.

366
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,628
The pretty people.

367
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,757
And the running.

368
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,261
I'm gonna go read in my room
for a little while.

369
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,306
Oh, oh. Okay, man.

370
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,739
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

371
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,783
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

372
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,992
Everybody!

373
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,995
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

374
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,498
<i>It's not your fault</i>

375
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,041
Monica.

376
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,626
<i>They won't take you to the vet</i>

377
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,419
Chandler.

378
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,841
<i>You're obviously not their favorite pet</i>

379
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,092
Joey.

380
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,011
<i>You may not be a bed of roses</i>

381
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,639
<i>And you're no friend
To those with noses</i>

382
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:35,104
Ross, those are the only lines we have.
Sorry. Okay. Back to the chorus.
