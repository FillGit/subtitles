1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,420
Ah, excuse me, this is a—

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:06,256
Closed set. We know. But we're
friends with the monkey, hmm?

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,260
Good morning.

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,054
Look who I brought!

5
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,181
Your old friend, Harry Elafonte!

6
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,854
Whoa, dude. Burn!

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,397
I don't get it.

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,733
He seemed so happy
to see me yesterday.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,279
Don't take it personal. He's under pressure,
starring in a movie and all.

10
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,697
Oh.

11
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,950
How big of a star is Marcel?

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,245
In human terms? I'd say...

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,955
-...Cybill Shepherd.
-Whoa.

14
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,665
-Really?
-Whoa.

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,295
So you guys in the movie
or you just really paranoid?

16
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,673
-Hey, Sal?
-Mm-hm?

17
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,925
Jerry wants to know
if the monkey's ready.

18
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,176
Excuse me?

19
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,179
Jerry is the director?
Which one's he?

20
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,140
-The one in the director's chair?
-Gotcha.

21
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,226
Pheebs, walk with me.

22
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,477
Okay.

23
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,813
Um, why am I walking with you?

24
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,400
Well, uh, we're just going
over here so that we can get away from...

25
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,319
...the horrible flesh-eating virus!

26
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,947
For the love of God, woman,
listen to me!

27
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,782
Is he looking? Is he looking?

28
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,505
-We've got a problem.
-Tell me.

29
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,008
I can't do Chris' makeup.

30
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,510
She refuses to acknowledge
her mustache.

31
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,263
-Is it bad?
-It looks like her eyebrow fell down.

32
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,600
Unless we convince her
to let me bleach it...

33
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,436
...Jean-Claude Van Damme will be
making out with Gabe Kaplan.

34
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,522
I'll talk to her.

35
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,774
I hate actors.

36
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:34,112
Nice camouflage. For a minute there,
I almost didn't see you.

37
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,034
-Excuse me. Whoa.
-Ah!

38
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,579
Uh, is your name Chandler?

39
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,623
Uh, yes, it is.

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,916
Chandler Bing.

41
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,711
Do you know me or are you
just really good at this game?

42
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,088
I'm Susie Moss.

43
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,715
Fourth grade? Glasses?

44
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,802
I carried a box of animal crackers
like a purse?

45
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,720
Susie Moss!

46
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,931
Right! Yeah! Wow!

47
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,141
You look....

48
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,811
Great job growing up.

49
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,731
It's nice to see you don't still
wear the cap with the mirrors on it.

50
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,443
Oh, I graduated fourth grade
and realized I wasn't a pimp.

51
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,071
Heh, hen. Remember the class play?

52
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,783
You pulled up my skirt and the
entire auditorium saw my underpants?

53
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:26,498
Yes. Back then, I, uh, used humor
as a defense mechanism.

54
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,166
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

55
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,465
-Oh, my God!
-What? What?

56
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,884
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

57
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,887
I didn't know he was in this movie.
He is so hot!

58
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,556
You think?

59
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:46,101
The Muscles from Brussels?
Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?

60
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,811
Did you see <i>Timecop?</i>

61
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,479
No. Was he any good in it?

62
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,357
Rachel, he totally changed time!

63
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,151
Wow.

64
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,362
-So why don't you go talk to him?
-Oh. Yeah.

65
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,657
Go tell him he's cute.
What's the worst that could happen?

66
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,117
He could hear me.

67
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,577
Oh.

68
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,455
-I'm doing it for you.
-Don't you dare! Don't!

69
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,831
Don't!

70
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,624
Tell him I cook!

71
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,127
Excuse me.

72
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,587
-Hi. Ha, ha.
-Hi.

73
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,715
Um, this is gonna sound kind of goofy.
Ha, ha.

74
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:21,428
But, um, my friend over there...

75
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,388
...who cooks, by the way....

76
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,057
Um, she thinks you're cute. Heh.

77
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,101
You don't think I'm cute?

78
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,438
I don't know. Um....

79
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,773
Do you think you're cute?

80
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,488
We're getting off the track.
Um, I was supposed to tell you...

81
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,157
...my friend thinks you're cute.

82
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,825
What should I tell her?

83
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:48,705
You can tell her
I think her friend is cute.

84
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,126
-Oh. Ha, ha.
-Huh?

85
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,338
Whoa. Ha, ha.

86
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,256
-Makeup!
-Oh, that's me. I gotta go.

87
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,133
Oh, uh....

88
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,843
Okay.

89
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:08,099
Um, how many times do I have to touch you
on the arm before you ask me on a date?

90
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,020
Well, uh, let's try one more.

91
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,815
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

92
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,400
I'll be there.

93
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,195
And if things go well,
maybe this time...

94
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,447
...I'll get to see your underwear.

95
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,664
No one was around to hear that?

96
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,504
-So, what'd he say?
-Ugh!

97
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,839
What a jerk!

98
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,134
I kept talking about you,
and he kept asking me out.

99
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,178
Oh.

100
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,306
Naturally, you know, I said no.

101
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,351
Well....

102
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,602
Thanks, anyway.

103
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,479
He just kept asking...

104
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,232
...and asking, asking, asking....

105
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,859
If you want to go out with him, you can.

106
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,321
Sounds like a jerk to me, but-

107
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,824
Jean-Claude, she said yes!
I'll see you tonight!

108
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,704
Thank you.

109
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,297
Then Jean-Claude took me to Crossroads...

110
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,674
...and we hung out
with Drew Barrymore.

111
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,135
Oh, man. She's so smoking!

112
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,137
She's got the greatest set of—

113
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,975
No guys around, huh?

114
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,479
-Anybody need anything?
-Oh, I'll have an espresso.

115
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,231
Oh, I'll get it.

116
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,693
If I ask you to,
you'll end up drinking it yourself.

117
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,615
-That is so unfair.
-I know.

118
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,827
Like you'd drink her coffee after
what you did to her with Van Damme?

119
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,914
I have to cancel racquetball tonight.

120
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,376
Marcel's trainer will let me
have him for a couple of hours.

121
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,378
You're blowing me off for a monkey?

122
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,339
We can reschedule for Saturday.

123
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,217
Yeah, unless you hook up
with a bunch of pigeons.

124
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,053
Hey.

125
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,679
Stick a fork in me...

126
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,930
...I am done!

127
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,432
Uh....

128
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,934
Stick a fork what?

129
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,144
Like when you're cooking a steak.

130
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,104
Oh, I don't eat meat.

131
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,900
How do you know vegetables are done?

132
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,195
Well, you don't.
You eat them and you can tell.

133
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,155
Okay, then eat me, I'm done!

134
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,865
Mm.

135
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,619
-I've met the perfect woman.
-What?

136
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,664
We're sitting on her couch,
fooling around...

137
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,208
...and then she turns to me and says:

138
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,168
"Did you ever want to do it
in an elevator?"

139
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,088
What did you say?

140
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,589
I believe my exact words were:

141
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,637
How do you know if you wanna do that?

142
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,888
Oh, you just know.

143
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,399
Oh, we gotta go.
Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

144
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,109
No, no, no.

145
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,488
What I had planned shouldn't take
more than two, three minutes, tops.

146
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,742
Two hundred seconds of passion!
We gotta go.

147
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,412
But, um...

148
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,123
...here's an idea.

149
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,210
Have you ever worn
women's underwear?

150
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,796
Well, yes, actually...

151
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,758
...but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's.

152
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,970
And there were three of us in there.

153
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,890
I was thinking
it would be, um, kind of sexy...

154
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,394
...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.

155
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,359
You want me to wear your panties?

156
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,944
Could you?

157
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,904
If I was wearing your underwear...

158
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,241
...then, uh, what would you be wearing?

159
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,499
You're swell!

160
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,755
I made Marcel's favorite dish,
banana cake...

161
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,047
-Ooh.
-...with mealworm.

162
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,511
Ah.

163
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,222
-Candle. Ha, ha.
-Ha, ha.

164
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,225
What do you think is
gonna happen here tonight?

165
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,190
Hello.

166
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,650
Oh, hi, are you on your way over-?

167
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,112
Oh.

168
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,617
No, I understand.
A monkey's gotta work.

169
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,286
It's no big deal.

170
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:43,291
It's not like I, uh, had anything
special planned, you know.

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,088
Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay, bye.

172
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,680
Okay. Rachel, why don't you
start talking first?

173
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,934
All right. I feel that this is totally unjustified.

174
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,270
She gave me the green light,
I did nothing-

175
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,275
Do you think I can't see you
in the TV set?

176
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,824
Monica, if there's something
you'd like to share-

177
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,659
You had no right to date him!

178
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,954
-That's the most ridiculous-
-You sold me out!

179
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,956
-I did not!
-You absolutely-

180
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,124
Would you let me talk!

181
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,712
Did you just flick me?

182
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,259
Well, you wouldn't let me
finish and I was-

183
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,595
-Ow, that hurt!
-Ow.

184
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,264
Quit flicking!

185
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,598
Ow! Stop flicking!

186
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,433
You flicked me first!

187
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,685
Ow!

188
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,436
Ow!

189
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,731
Okay, no, no.

190
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,983
Let's not do this!

191
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,653
-Come on. Happy thoughts.
-No! No!

192
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,572
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!

193
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,449
No! Ow! No!

194
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,077
-Oh! Oh!
-Oh, God!

195
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:04,372
Oh! Ow!

196
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,416
Now I'm gonna kick some ass!

197
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,003
-Ow.
-Ow.

198
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:15,258
Ow, ow, ow.

199
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:19,220
All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.

200
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:23,433
-Oh! You want me to stop seeing him?
-Uh-huh.

201
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,978
You want me to just tell him
you're seeing him instead?

202
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,189
-Is that what you want?
-Okay.

203
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,443
Oh, that's what you want?

204
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,694
Yes.

205
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,323
-Fine!
-Fine!

206
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,908
There we go.

207
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,159
-Ow.
-Oh.

208
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,746
Ha. If we were in prison,
you guys would be, like, my bitches.

209
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,840
Thanks for letting me tag along.

210
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,342
Forget about it.

211
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,138
-How you doing there, squirmy?
-I'm hanging in.

212
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,223
And a little out.

213
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,188
So assistant to the director?

214
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:14,234
That's an exciting job.
You must have a ton of responsibilities-

215
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,944
I don't do the casting.

216
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,029
So, what are you guys gonna eat?

217
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,451
How come all I can think about
is putting that ice in my mouth...

218
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:27,205
...and licking you all over?

219
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:33,253
Because I went to an all-boys high school,
and God is making up for it?

220
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,467
I want you right here...

221
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,302
...right now.

222
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,554
Right now, right here?

223
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,349
Don't you think we're in
kind of a public place?

224
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,020
They do have the shrimp.

225
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,899
-Oh.
-Meet me in the bathroom.

226
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,075
I'm going to the bathroom now.

227
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,044
Come on.

228
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,756
All right, mister.

229
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,134
Let's see those panties.

230
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,970
Alrighty.

231
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,056
Ooh. Ooh.

232
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,435
But you know what would be even sexier?

233
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,186
What?

234
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,273
If you didn't have your
shirt tucked into them.

235
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,942
Oh.

236
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:42,572
All right. Now, I would like
to see you wearing nothing but them.

237
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,074
Take your clothes off.

238
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,493
But, uh, I hope you realize this means...

239
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,662
...we'll miss hearing about the specials.

240
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,707
Come on, hurry!

241
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,960
Do you want this done quick or done right?

242
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,839
All right, turn around.
I wanna see you from behind.

243
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:04,969
Oh, oh. Somebody's been doing
his <i>Buns of Steel </i>video.

244
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,598
So you want me to, uh,
clench anything or...?

245
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,435
Susie?

246
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,645
Susie?

247
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,065
This, ha, ha, is for the fourth grade.

248
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,403
-Huh? What do you mean?
-What do I mean?

249
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,654
What do I mean?

250
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,491
I mean underpants, mister!
That's what I mean!

251
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,035
What? What do you mean?

252
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,536
My skirt...

253
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,456
...you lifted. Kids laughing!

254
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,292
I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!

255
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,631
That was in fourth grade!
How could you still be upset?

256
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,007
Well, um....

257
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:47,261
Call me in 20 years and tell me
if you're still upset about this.

258
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,728
I hope you realize you're not
getting these underpants back!

259
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,365
I can't believe this. Ha, ha.

260
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,910
Just two weeks ago,
I was watching <i>Sudden Death...</i>

261
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,664
...and now I'm on a date
with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

262
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,374
Can you beat up that guy?

263
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,959
Yeah.

264
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,545
-Can you beat up that guy?
-Sure.

265
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,214
Oh, this is so wild.

266
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:28,511
I gotta admit, I was surprised
that you agreed to go on a blind date.

267
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,638
Normally, I would not do it.

268
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,889
Yeah?

269
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,226
What made you make the exception for me?

270
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,519
Rachel told me, uh...

271
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:40,440
...you were dying to have a threesome
with me and, uh, Drew Barrymore.

272
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,860
By the way,
Drew has some ground rules and....

273
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,780
-Say you're sorry!
-No!

274
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,948
Say it!

275
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,992
No! I'm not gonna!

276
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,246
-Say it! Say it! Great!
-Oh!

277
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,206
Rachel.

278
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,334
Say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.

279
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,131
That is my favorite sweater!
That is my third-date sweater!

280
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,510
Say you're sorry.

281
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,972
You wanna play? Okay, let's play.

282
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,307
Let's play.

283
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,063
What are you gonna do?

284
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,150
Give me back my sweater
or it's handbag marinara.

285
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,738
You don't have the guts.

286
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,284
Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken
to tell some guy he was cute.

287
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,589
Oh, all right, stop! Stop the madness!

288
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,761
This is crazy!

289
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,056
Who can remember why
you're fighting in the first place?

290
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,103
Yes, that's right.

291
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,149
But still....

292
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,817
Look at your purse!

293
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,153
Look at your sweater!

294
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,782
Look at yourselves!

295
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,828
I'll help you fix your sweater.

296
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,956
I'll help you...

297
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,166
...throw out your purse.

298
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,212
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

299
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,091
I'm sorry I went out with him
when I knew you liked him.

300
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,097
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

301
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,743
Joey?

302
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,662
Ma?

303
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,124
Joey!

304
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,544
What are you doing here?
I thought you guys took off.

305
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,921
She took off with my clothes!

306
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,427
-Are you naked in there?
-Well, not exactly.

307
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,097
I'm wearing panties.

308
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,017
Huh.

309
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,353
You, uh, always wear panties?

310
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,316
No, no. This is the first time.

311
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,777
Wow. Talk about your bad luck!

312
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,324
I mean, the first time you try panties
and someone walks off with your clothes.

313
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,954
I was not trying them out.
Susie asked me to wear them.

314
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,623
Let me see!

315
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,251
No! I'm not letting you
or anybody else see, ever!

316
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,503
All right, all right!

317
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,591
Whoa.

318
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,594
Someone's flossing!

319
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,394
Joey, some people don't like that.

320
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,689
Chandler's wearing panties.

321
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,107
What?

322
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,277
-Let me see!
-You don't have to see!

323
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,613
Hi, tushy!

324
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,077
-One of you give me your underpants.
-Oh, no.

325
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,536
I'm not wearing any.

326
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,041
How can you not be wearing any?

327
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:31,003
Oh. I'm getting heat from the guy
in the hot-pink thong.

328
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,633
Look, Ross. I'll give you
$50 for your underpants.

329
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,676
Hey.

330
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,830
-Can I have the milk?
-I'm almost done with it.

331
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,081
Keep your panties on.

332
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,879
Hey. Hey.

333
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,257
-And I'm in the movie!
-Hey.

334
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,801
-What happened?
-A virus victim called in sick...

335
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,388
...so Cathy recommended me and boom!
I'm dying on a gurney!

336
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,640
-Hey!
-Oh.

337
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,811
Oh, Marcel just finished his last scene,
if you wanna go say goodbye.

338
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,400
Uh, that's okay. He's probably
got parties to go to and stuff.

339
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:40,239
You know, he's moved on.
That's the way it goes, right?

340
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,075
Oh, my God!

341
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,744
What?

342
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,501
I think I want to write a song about all this.

343
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,544
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

344
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,131
Ooh, except one of the strings
on my guitar is broken.

345
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,383
Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?

346
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,180
-How long you been waiting to say that?
-About 20 minutes!

347
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,021
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

348
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,983
Cut!

349
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,487
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

350
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,074
Cut!

351
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,119
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

352
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,749
-Mommy!
-Ah.

353
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,920
Can't you see what's going on?
This man is dead!
