1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,637
<i>Can't get the monkey off your back?</i>

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,182
<i>Then put it in your mouth...</i>

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,267
<i>...with Monkeyshine Beer!</i>

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,105
<i>Wow.</i>

5
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,986
<i>Monkeyshine Beer.</i>

6
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,489
<i>Because it's a jungle out there!</i>

7
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,283
That commercial always
makes me so sad.

8
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:36,703
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer
and girls run at him...

9
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,914
...so everything works out okay.

10
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,334
I meant because the monkey in it
reminds me of Marcel.

11
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,710
I can see that.

12
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:48,507
Because they both have those big
brown eyes and the little pouty chin.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,385
And the fact that
they're both monkeys?

14
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,972
I wonder if I did the right thing,
giving him away.

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,476
Ross, you had to. He was
humping everything in sight.

16
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,564
I mean, I have a Malibu Barbie who will
no longer be wearing white to her wedding.

17
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,402
Remember when he'd borrow your hat...

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,364
...and when you got it back,
there'd be little monkey raisins in it?

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,827
When he did it, it was funny.
When I did it to my boss's hat....

20
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,456
All of a sudden, I had
this big "attitude problem."

21
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:11,840
Hey. Hey.

22
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,676
-Check it out! Guess what I got?
-Rhythm?

23
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,888
No. My first fan mail!

24
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,473
Check it out.

25
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,475
"Dear Dr. Ramoray:

26
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,811
Know that I love you and
would do anything to have you."

27
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,023
My gosh! "Your not-so-secret
admirer, Erika Ford."

28
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,734
Oh, wait.

29
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:35,405
"P.S. Enclosed, please find
14 of my eyelashes."

30
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,993
You know, in Crazy World,
that means you're married.

31
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,874
It's not addressed to <i>Days Of Our Lives.
</i>This came to your apartment.

32
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,668
There's no stamp on it.
This woman was in our building.

33
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,253
Oh, my God.

34
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,006
I got my very own stalker!

35
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,676
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

36
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,178
-Hey.
-Ooh.

37
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,429
Where are you off to?

38
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,307
There's this paleontology
conference in L.A.

39
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:06,561
So I figured I'd go and drive down
to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

40
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,107
I think he will be surprised.
Till he realizes he's a monkey...

41
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,486
...and, uh, you know,
isn't capable of that emotion.

42
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,282
Oh, Phoebe? That really cute guy
is here again.

43
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,575
Oh? Oh.

44
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,910
Okay, so everyone, ahem...

45
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,455
...pretend I'm telling you a story
and it's really funny.

46
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,040
So everyone just laugh. Now!

47
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,503
I know, I know! Oh.

48
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,921
-Hello.
-Hi.

49
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,464
Oh.

50
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,841
I'm Rob Donan.

51
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,134
Hi, Rob Donan.

52
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,596
I don't know anything about music,
but I think you're really great.

53
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,433
Oh, wow. Ha, ha.

54
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,395
Anyway, I schedule performers
for children's libraries.

55
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:53,316
And I was thinking, have you thought
about playing your songs for kids?

56
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,110
Oh, I would love to have kids...

57
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,367
...hear me play the songs
that I will write for them.

58
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,621
What do you wanna do for dinner?

59
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,832
We could stay in and cook for ourselves.

60
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,923
-Hello.
-<i>It's Erika.</i>

61
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,842
Oh, my God. The stalker!

62
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,260
<i>Never mind. It's open.</i>

63
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,304
Aah! Aah!

64
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,348
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan
is a good idea.

65
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,352
We might wanna have a backup plan,
though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.

66
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,189
Let's get out of here!

67
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,860
The one time they're not home!

68
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,695
Okay. Okay.

69
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,781
We'll leave.
When we pass her...

70
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,700
...she won't know me,
because we never met!

71
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,704
That's how radio stars
escape stalkers!

72
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,208
She's coming!

73
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,298
-It's me.
-Aah!

74
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:02,093
Uh, this is it.
This is how we're gonna die.

75
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,056
-You ready?
-Wait, wait, wait!

76
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,564
Hi.

77
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,691
Erika!

78
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,536
-Mr. Geller?
-Yes, hi.

79
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,497
Hi. Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

80
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,457
I was told you had a question.

81
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:37,337
I, uh- I can't find the monkey I donated
last year. He's a capuchin...

82
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,130
...answers to the name Marcel?

83
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,926
Ah. I'm afraid I have some bad news.

84
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,595
Marcel has passed on.

85
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,933
Oh, my God. What happened?

86
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,727
Well, he got sick,
and then he got sicker...

87
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,980
...and then he got a little better.

88
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,148
But then he died.

89
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,111
I can't believe this!

90
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,116
I'm sorry, Mr. Geller.
But you know, there's an old saying:

91
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,952
"Sometimes monkeys die."

92
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,956
It's not a great saying...

93
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,334
...but it certainly is fitting today.

94
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,462
-Someone should've called me.
-I'm sorry.

95
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,090
Look, I know this can't
bring him back...

96
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,718
...but here, it's just a gesture.

97
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,846
Zoo dollars?

98
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:32,350
Yes, and come see the bird show
at 4. The macaws wear hats.

99
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,022
Well, it's a lot cuter
if your monkey hasn't just died.

100
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,070
Ooh.

101
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,780
I know.

102
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,951
I can't believe Joey's having
lunch with his stalker.

103
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,703
What is she like?

104
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,372
-Well, you remember Kathy Bates in <i>Misery?</i>
-Mm-hm.

105
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,709
Well, she looks
the exact opposite of that.

106
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,920
And she's not crazy?

107
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,714
Oh, no, no.
She's a total wack job.

108
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:07,677
Yeah. She thinks that Joey is
actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.

109
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,262
Oh, my God!

110
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,556
Oh. And he's going out with her?

111
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,433
He cannot pursue this.

112
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,270
Just because this woman thinks she can
see Joey through the magical box...

113
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,023
...in her living room
doesn't mean she's not a person.

114
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,652
Does she not deserve happiness?
Does she not deserve love?

115
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,948
What are you looking at me for?
He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.

116
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,117
Are you okay?

117
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,453
No, uh-uh. I'm just nervous.

118
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,956
Maybe if I just picture them all
in their underwear....

119
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,085
That's not a good idea. That's
the reason the last guy got fired.

120
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,711
Oh.

121
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,131
Yeah.

122
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,592
I'm used to playing for grownups.

123
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,304
Grownups drink their coffee
and do their grownup thing, you know.

124
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,597
And kids...

125
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,057
...listen.

126
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,061
It's just a huge responsibility.

127
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,396
What?

128
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,481
Are you gonna kiss me?

129
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:03,942
I was thinking about it.

130
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,486
Okay.

131
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,616
Yeah, okay. Alrighty. Let's play some tunes!

132
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,954
Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.

133
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,498
Hi, Phoebe!

134
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,001
Ha, ha. Okay. Um...

135
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,213
...I'm gonna play, um, some songs
about grandparents, okay?

136
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,927
<i>Now Grandma's a person
Who everyone likes</i>

137
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,180
<i>She bought you a train
And a bright shiny bike</i>

138
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,434
<i>But lately she hasn't
Been coming to dinner</i>

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,937
<i>And last time you saw her
She looked so much thinner</i>

140
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,483
<i>Now your mom and your dad said
She moved to Peru</i>

141
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,987
<i>But the truth is she died
And someday you will too</i>

142
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:53,825
<i>La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la</i>

143
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:58,163
<i>La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la</i>

144
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,917
-Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
-Yeah, it is.

145
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,254
What?

146
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,716
Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...

147
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:14,304
...and just a little while ago you were
reattaching Simone's spinal cord.

148
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,805
Yeah, that was a tricky one.

149
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,725
In reality...

150
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:23,062
...that operation takes over 10 hours,
but they only showed it for two minutes.

151
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,856
Who's "they"?

152
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,401
No one.

153
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:34,657
Oh, Drake, you are so talented.
Let me see those hands.

154
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,285
-Oh, these hands, these beautiful hands.
-Ha, ha.

155
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,246
Ha, ha. Oh, I could just eat them.

156
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,748
-But I won't.
-Ha, ha.

157
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,125
Good.
Otherwise my watch would fall off.

158
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,008
No, seriously.

159
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,677
These hands...

160
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,430
...these miracle, magical,
life-giving hands.

161
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,726
Oh, just to be near them, touch them,
maybe even lick one?

162
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,271
-All right. Ha, ha. Just one.
-Ha-ha-ha.

163
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,155
Wow.

164
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,740
You're good at that.

165
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,328
Oh, my God! Someone!
He's choking!

166
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,580
Is anyone here a doctor?

167
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,832
Oh, yes.

168
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,834
Yes, the best doctor in Salem!

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,128
Dr. Drake Ramoray!

170
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:47,605
Meet me in the nocturnal
house in 15 minutes.

171
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:54,904
Uh, hey, look. I don't really enjoy
being with other men that way.

172
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,949
But, um, zoo dollars?

173
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,578
It's about your monkey.

174
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,746
It's alive.

175
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,129
I don't understand.
Why didn't you help that man?

176
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,632
Uh, because, uh,
I'm a neurosurgeon...

177
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,720
...and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh...

178
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,096
..."foodal chokage."

179
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,849
You know.

180
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,062
-I gotta tell you something-
-No, no, no.

181
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,106
You don't have to tell me anything.

182
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,650
You don't have
to explain yourself to me. Oh!

183
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,945
Who am I to question
the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?

184
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,197
-That's-
-I should be happy to be near you.

185
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,490
Hey, I-

186
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,913
"Hey" what?

187
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,498
That's it. Just hey!

188
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,627
Like at the end of a dance. Hey!

189
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,256
Hey. Ha-ha-ha.

190
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,342
Hey.

191
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,219
<i>There'll be times when you get older</i>

192
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,055
<i>When you'll want to sleep with people</i>

193
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,516
<i>Just to make them like you
But don't</i>

194
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:07,852
<i>'Cause</i>

195
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,481
<i>That's another thing
That you don't wanna do</i>

196
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,649
Everybody!

197
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:17,695
<i>That's another thing
That you don't wanna do</i>

198
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,032
-Excellent!
-Very informative!

199
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,035
Not at all inappropriate!

200
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:28,164
Thank you for coming, everybody.
There are cookies in the back.

201
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,084
That was great.

202
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,502
The kids loved you.

203
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,255
Yay! I rock!

204
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,342
And you know why?
Because you told the truth.

205
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,678
Nobody ever tells kids the truth.

206
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,554
You were incredible!

207
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,890
Ha, ha. But...?

208
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,811
-How did you know there was a "but"?
-I sense these things.

209
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,146
It was either "but" or "butter."

210
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,359
The thing is, I think
some of the parents...

211
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,236
...they were hoping that...

212
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,364
...you'd play more songs
about barnyard animals.

213
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,824
I can do that.

214
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,117
-Really?
-Yeah.

215
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,578
-Because that would be fantastic.
-Oh.

216
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,707
What? You wanna kiss me?

217
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,583
I'm thinking about it.

218
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,587
Ah, the bat.

219
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,299
Ambassador of darkness.

220
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,594
Flitting out of his cave
like a winged messenger.

221
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,265
Sightless specter of the macabre.

222
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,767
Buddy, my monkey?

223
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,936
Oh, yeah, right.

224
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,897
There was a break-in...

225
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,859
...a few months back. Inside job.

226
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,360
Your monkey was taken.

227
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,946
Oh, my God. The zoo told me
that my monkey was dead.

228
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,115
Pfft. The zoo!

229
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,826
You believe everything
the zoo tells you?

230
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,832
Uh, that's the only thing
the zoo's ever told me.

231
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,377
Of course they'll say he's dead.
They don't want the bad publicity.

232
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,004
It's all a great big cover-up.

233
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:02,091
Do you have any idea
how high up this thing goes?

234
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,010
That guy Lipson?

235
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,095
Lipson knows?

236
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,847
Hmm.

237
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,640
Lipson knows, huh?

238
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,060
Ah, hello, Mr. Possum.

239
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,022
Enigma of the trees,
upside-down denizen of the night.

240
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,317
-Taunting gravity-
-Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?

241
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,029
Word on the street-

242
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:27,533
Well, when I say "street," I mean
those little pretend streets here at the zoo.

243
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,118
Of course.

244
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,456
Your monkey found a new career...

245
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:37,043
...in the entertainment field.
That's all I know.

246
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,921
This is unbelievable!

247
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:45,051
So, what is this information
worth to you, my friend?

248
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,596
Are you trying
to get me to bribe you?

249
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,306
Maybe.

250
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,185
But you already told me everything.

251
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,613
Check it out. He actually is
the Monkeyshine monkey.

252
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,824
Oh, wow. So, what are you gonna do?

253
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,327
I'm gonna call the beer company
and try to find out where he is.

254
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,455
That's what I did
when I lost my Clydesdales.

255
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,999
Okay, hi again!

256
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,877
Hi, Phoebe!

257
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,674
Today, we're gonna start with
some songs about barnyard animals.

258
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,636
<i>Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"</i>

259
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,847
<i>Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"</i>

260
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,516
<i>Then the farmer hits him on the head
And grinds him up</i>

261
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,810
<i>And that's how we get hamburgers</i>

262
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,066
<i>Now chickens</i>

263
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,403
<i>You're the only one who can save her, Drake!</i>

264
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,322
<i>Damn it! I'm a doctor, I'm not God!</i>

265
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,616
Well, there goes my whole belief system.

266
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,162
It's Erika.

267
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,872
Quick! Quick. Shut off the TV.

268
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,957
Wait, I wanna see what happens!

269
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,501
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma
then we make out.

270
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,962
How can that be?
You were just kissing Sabrina.

271
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,091
Rachel, it's a world
where Joey is a neurosurgeon.

272
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,929
Hey, Erika. Come in.

273
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,391
How did you get here so fast?
I just saw you in Salem.

274
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,728
Right, they, uh, choppered me in.
Ha, ha.

275
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,354
What's up?

276
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,607
Oh, you're having a little party too.

277
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,151
-Is she here, huh, huh?
-Who?

278
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,486
Sabrina. I know about you two!

279
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,823
I saw you today, kissing
in the doctor's lounge.

280
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,076
It's not what you think.
That was-

281
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,329
You told me I was the only one!

282
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,210
All right, look. That's it.

283
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,420
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

284
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,547
I should have told you
a long time ago...

285
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,383
...but I am not Drake Ramoray, okay?

286
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,304
I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor.
I just pretend to be a doctor.

287
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,724
Oh, my God. Do the people
at the hospital know about this?

288
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,396
Ha, ha.
Somebody wanna help me out here?

289
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,899
Oh, I know! I know!

290
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,734
<i>Where am I?</i>

291
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,611
<i>University Hospital...</i>

292
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,447
<i>...the same place you've been
for the last 18 years.</i>

293
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,617
How can you be here and there?

294
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,911
Ha, ha.
Because it's a television show.

295
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,372
Drake, what are you getting at?

296
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,209
I'm not Drake!

297
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,295
That's right. He's not Drake. He's...

298
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,257
...Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin!

299
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,888
Is this true?

300
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,225
Yes! Yes, it is true.

301
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,227
And I know this...

302
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,814
...because he pretended
to be Drake to sleep with me!

303
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,864
And then he told me
he would run away with me.

304
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,449
And he didn't!

305
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,829
And you left the toilet seat up,
you bastard!

306
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,336
Is all this true?

307
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,427
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

308
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,762
You deserve much better than me, Erika.

309
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:21,475
You deserve to be with the real Drake.
He's the one you fell in love with.

310
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,936
Go to Salem. Find him!

311
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,147
He's the guy for you.

312
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,898
Oh, Hans.

313
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,944
Hans?

314
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,904
Hans!

315
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,699
Yo, evil twin!

316
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,452
Right. Uh, goodbye, Erika.

317
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,204
Good luck in Salem.

318
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,207
Take care.

319
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,002
I'll never forget you, Hans.

320
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,009
Ha, ha. All right.
The people who threw the water!

321
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,719
Helping you out!

322
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,056
Fired? Why?

323
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,309
The library board has had
a lot of complaints from parents...

324
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,437
-...about some of the stuff in your songs.
-I can't believe it!

325
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:10,608
Did you tell your board about how
the kids want to hear the truth?

326
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,444
No.

327
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,947
I see.

328
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:21,077
Maybe if you just played
some regular kiddie songs?

329
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,578
No.

330
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,705
What do you want me to be?
Like some...

331
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,918
...stupid, big,
like, purple dinosaur?

332
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,920
You don't have to be Barney.

333
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,172
-Who's Barney?
-Eh-

334
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,555
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this:
He's healthy, he's happy...

335
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,768
...and he's here in New York filming
<i>Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.</i>

336
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,144
You're kidding!

337
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,355
-This is amazing.
-I know.

338
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,983
I finally get a part on TV,
and the monkey's making movies.

339
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,153
Okay. Rachel, I'm ready.

340
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,405
Okay.

341
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,286
Excuse me. Is this where the
singing lady is who tells the truth?

342
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,456
Um, yeah, I guess that's me.

343
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,292
She's here!

344
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,595
<i>Sometimes men love women</i>

345
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,432
<i>And sometimes men love men</i>

346
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,059
<i>And then there are bisexuals</i>

347
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,312
<i>Though some just say
They're kidding themselves</i>

348
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,608
<i>La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la</i>

349
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,778
<i>La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la</i>

350
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,033
This is exciting. I haven't
seen my monkey in a year.

351
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,703
What, you never
look down in the shower?

352
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:50,666
Oh, please. I'm not allowed to make
one joke in the "monkey is penis" genre?

353
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,501
Back up, please.

354
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,211
Back up. Come on, come on.

355
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,006
Excuse me.
Uh, where can we find the monkey?

356
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,674
I'm sorry. It's a closed set.

357
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,886
I'm sorry, you don't understand.
I'm a friend of his.

358
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,388
We, uh, used to live together.

359
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,808
Yeah. And I have a timeshare
in the Poconos with Flipper.

360
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:11,812
Ross, there he is!

361
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,190
Hey! Hey, buddy!

362
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,984
Marcel! Marcel!

363
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:29,830
<i>In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight</i>

364
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:39,632
<i>In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight</i>

365
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,621
<i>They won't take you to the vet</i>

366
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,333
<i>You're obviously not
Their favorite pet</i>

367
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,170
<i>-Smelly cat, smelly cat
-Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

368
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,632
<i>-It's not your fault
-It's not your fault</i>

369
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:26,220
<i>No</i>

370
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,347
-Ha-ha-ha. I'm sorry.
-What?

371
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,807
What's wrong with that?

372
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,228
Um, ahem, I think you might wanna,
like, pick a more masculine note. Heh.
