1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,341
-Ross kissed me.
-No!

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,843
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,512
It was unbelievable!

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,765
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,391
We wanna hear everything.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,602
Monica, get the wine
and unplug the phone.

7
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,437
-Okay.
-Rachel.

8
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,898
Does this end well
or do we need to get tissues?

9
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,276
-Oh, it ended very well.
-Oh.

10
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:29,363
Do not start without me!
Do not start without me!

11
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,241
Okay. All right.
Let's hear about the kiss.

12
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,868
Was it like a soft brush
against your lips...

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,705
...or was it like a, you know,
"I gotta have you now" kind of thing?

14
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:43,252
Well, at first it was really intense,
you know? And then....

15
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,296
Oh, God. And then we just
sort of sunk into it.

16
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:50,676
Oh.... So, okay, was he holding you?
Or were his hands on your back?

17
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,388
No, actually, ahem, first
they started out on my waist...

18
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,182
...and then they slid up
and then they were in my hair.

19
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,600
-Oh.
-Oh.

20
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,603
And, uh....

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,980
And then I kissed her.

22
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,273
Tongue?

23
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,024
-Yeah.
-Cool.

24
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,074
All right, check out this bad boy!

25
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,620
Twelve megabytes of RAM,
500-megabyte hard drive...

26
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,663
...built-in spreadsheet capabilities...

27
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:05,834
...and a modem that transmits
at over 28,000 BPS.

28
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,878
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?

29
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,547
Games and stuff.

30
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,093
There are no jobs.
There are no jobs for me.

31
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,554
Oh, wait, here's one. Uh....

32
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,975
-Would you be willing to cook naked?
-There's an ad for a naked chef?

33
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:27,105
No, but if you're willing to cook naked,
then you might be willing to dance naked.

34
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,566
-And then....
-Mm.

35
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,652
-Hi.
-Hey.

36
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,488
-Hey.
-Oh, so how'd you make out last night?

37
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,869
That is funny.
That is painfully funny.

38
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,454
No, wait, wait.

39
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,998
Yeah, that's just painful.

40
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,335
Wait a minute.
I thought last night was great.

41
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,504
Yeah, it was.
But I get home, okay...

42
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,757
...and I see Julie's saline solution
on my night table...

43
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,468
...and I think, "Oh, my God.
What the hell am I doing?"

44
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,554
I mean, here I am with Julie,
this incredible, great woman...

45
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,516
...who I care about
and who cares about me...

46
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,851
...and am I just gonna
throw all that away?

47
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,437
You got all that
from saline solution?

48
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,234
Wait a minute. We're talking
about Rachel here. You and Rachel.

49
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,404
Believe me, I've been dreaming
about me and Rachel for 10 years.

50
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,364
But now I'm with Julie.

51
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,409
You know? So it's like, me and Julie,
me and Rachel.

52
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,786
Me and Julie, me and Rach-

53
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,579
Rachel! Rachel.

54
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,874
-Hey, you.
-How are you?

55
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,584
Good. How are you?

56
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,086
-Good. Um....
-Good.

57
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,714
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?

58
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,465
Julie!

59
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,427
Um, how are you?

60
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,053
-Good.
-Good.

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,596
So everybody's here.

62
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,391
Everybody's good.

63
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,229
Were you gonna play something?

64
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,314
-Oh. Well, actually-
-Play it!

65
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,566
Oh.

66
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,861
All right.

67
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,904
-Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
-What?

68
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,614
Shh.

69
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,659
Okay. Um, hi.

70
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,412
Hello. Hi. Okay.

71
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,955
So, um.... Ahem.

72
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,208
This is a song, um,
about a love triangle...

73
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,419
...between three people I made up.

74
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,050
Um, it's called, um,
"Two of Them Kissed Last Night."

75
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,224
<i>There was a girl
We'll call her Betty</i>

76
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,728
<i>And a guy
Let's call him Neil</i>

77
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,274
<i>Now I can't stress
This point too strongly</i>

78
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,444
<i>This story isn't real</i>

79
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:44,659
<i>Now our Neil must decide
Who will be the girl that he casts aside?</i>

80
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,078
<i>Will Betty be the one
Who he loves truly?</i>

81
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,665
<i>Or will it be the one
Who we'll call Loolie?</i>

82
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,588
<i>He must decide
He must decide</i>

83
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:02,219
<i>Even though I made him up
He must decide</i>

84
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,847
Well, this is a nice resume.

85
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,892
Nice, nice, nice.

86
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:16,358
Uh, Mr. Rastatter, what does this
job entail? The ad wasn't clear.

87
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,152
Mockolate.

88
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,196
-I'm sorry?
-Mockolate.

89
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,615
It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

90
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,659
Ooh.

91
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,453
-Well, go ahead, try a piece.
-Oh.

92
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,706
Yeah, we think that Mockolate
is even better than chocolate.

93
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,125
-All right.
-Ha, ha.

94
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,965
Mm.

95
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,675
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

96
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,260
I love how it crumbles.

97
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,639
-You see, chocolate doesn't do that.
-Ha-ha-ha. No, ma'am.

98
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,643
Anyhoo, we should be getting
our FDA approval any day now.

99
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,144
Ha-ha-ha.

100
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,814
-Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.
-Mm.

101
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,483
See, the way we look at it,
chocolate dominates...

102
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,571
...your major food-preparation holidays.
Easter, Christmas, what have you.

103
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,865
-Mm-hm.
-But we think given the right marketing...

104
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,577
...we can make Thanksgiving
the Mockolate holiday.

105
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,079
Wow.

106
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,915
-Aren't you gonna swallow that?
-Ha, ha.

107
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,043
-Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
-Oh.

108
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,670
Yeah. Isn't that great?

109
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,006
-Mm.
-Ha-ha-ha.

110
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,591
Well, anyhoo, um...

111
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,219
...we're looking for chefs who can
create Thanksgiving-themed recipes.

112
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,679
You interested?

113
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,306
Abso-

114
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,266
Ahem. —lutely!

115
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,688
See, I love creating new recipes,
I love Thanksgiving, and, well, now...

116
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,106
...I love Mockolate.

117
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,399
-Really?
-Mm.

118
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,277
Especially that aftertaste.
You know, I tell you...

119
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,987
...that'll last you till Christmas.

120
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,619
How about Mockolate mousse?

121
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,287
It's not...

122
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,122
...very Thanksgiving-y.

123
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,125
Okay, how about
Pilgrim Mockolate mousse?

124
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,252
What makes it Pilgrim?

125
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,005
We'll put buckles on it.

126
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,798
-Hey.
-Hey.

127
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,217
-Hey.
-Did Ross call?

128
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,136
No, I'm sorry.

129
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,472
Why didn't he call?

130
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,515
He's gonna stay with Julie.

131
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,851
He's gonna stay with her
and she'll be:

132
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,354
"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.

133
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:21,691
We'll get married and have lots
of kids and dig up stuff together!"

134
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,029
No offense, but that
sounds nothing like her.

135
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,994
I don't know what I'll do. What am I gonna
do? This is like a complete nightmare!

136
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:37,332
Oh, I know. This must be so hard.
"Oh, no! Two women love me!

137
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,920
They're both gorgeous and sexy,
my wallet's too small for my 50s...

138
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,631
...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"

139
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:50,011
-Hey, here's a thought, Ross-
-Don't ever touch the computer.

140
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,848
Ross, listen.
I got two words for you:

141
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,809
Threesome.

142
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,023
Right, look. Let's get logical
about this. We'll make a list.

143
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,817
"Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons."

144
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,070
-Oh.
-Oh.

145
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,574
We'll put their names
in bold with different fonts...

146
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,327
...and I can use different
colors for each column.

147
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,870
Can't we just use a pen?

148
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,248
No, Amish boy.

149
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,752
Let's start with the cons
because they're more fun.

150
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,754
Ha-ha-ha. Rachel first.

151
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,298
I don't know.

152
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,633
I mean....

153
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,388
All right, I guess you can say
she's a little spoiled sometimes.

154
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,681
You could say that.

155
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,433
Yeah.

156
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,311
I guess, you know, sometimes
she's a little ditzy, you know?

157
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,607
And I've seen her be a little
too into her looks.

158
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,444
Uh. Oh, and Julie and I have
a lot in common...

159
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,613
...because we're both
paleontologists, right?

160
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,615
But Rachel's just a waitress.

161
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,200
Waitress.

162
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,786
Got it.
You guys wanna play "Doom"?

163
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,791
Or we could keep doing this.

164
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,919
What else?

165
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,880
I don't know.

166
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,051
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.

167
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,220
Okay, let's do Julie.

168
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,764
What's wrong with her?

169
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,811
She's not Rachel.

170
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,485
Okay. This is pumpkin pie
with a Mockolate crust.

171
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,363
This is Mockolate cranberry cake,
and these are Mockolate-chip cookies.

172
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,783
Just like the Indians served.

173
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,245
Oh, my God!

174
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,497
"Oh, my God" good?

175
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,459
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you let me put this in my mouth.

176
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,752
Oh! Ugh!

177
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,005
Sweet Lord!
Oh, this is what evil must taste like!

178
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,888
I'm telling you, this thing won't print.

179
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,683
Yes, I pressed that button, like, 100 times.

180
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,977
You know, for a hotline,
you're not so hot.

181
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,148
What is that in the background?

182
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,817
Are you watching <i>Star Trek?</i>

183
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,615
Hey.

184
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,535
So how'd it go with Julie?
Did you break her heart?

185
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,828
Yes.

186
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:24,499
It was horrible. She cried, I cried.
She threw things, they hit me.

187
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,209
Mm.

188
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,670
I did the right thing.

189
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,506
So Spock actually hugs his father?

190
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,510
Hey, do you guys have-?

191
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,097
-Hi.
-Hi.

192
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,431
Where you going?

193
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,518
I just got back from, uh....

194
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,562
From Julie's.

195
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,022
Oh.

196
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,274
No, no.

197
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,276
Uh, it's not what you think. Urn....

198
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,027
It's the other thing.

199
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,163
Well, heh, ahem, what's the other thing?
What do I think?

200
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,749
Well, uh....

201
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,167
He broke up with Julie!

202
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,839
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes!

203
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,216
Really?

204
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,467
Really.

205
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,345
It's always been you, Rach.

206
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,264
Oh, God.

207
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,771
Oh.

208
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,775
Oh.

209
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,569
Oh, this is good.

210
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,946
-This is really good.
-I know. I know.

211
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,990
It's almost....

212
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,458
What do you say we go take a walk?
Just us. Not them.

213
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,169
-Okay. Let me get my coat.
-Okay. No, hey, whoa, whoa.

214
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,546
I'll get your coat.

215
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,924
Okay.

216
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,140
He's going to get my coat.
He's going to get my coat, Joey!

217
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:08,686
Oh, my God, you guys, I can't believe this!
This is unbelievable!

218
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,940
-What's that?
-What? Nothing!

219
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,861
-What? I saw my name. What is it?
-No, no, see? See?

220
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,696
Hey, it's printing!

221
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,949
Hey, it's printing!

222
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,451
What is it? Let me see!

223
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,245
Hey, someone order a coat?

224
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,748
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me
and he won't let me see.

225
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,084
He won't? He won't!

226
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,462
Because isn't that...

227
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,839
...the short story you were writing?

228
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,093
Yes, it is a short story...

229
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,678
...that I was writing.

230
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,763
And I'm in it? Well, let me read it.

231
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,640
No!

232
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:51,020
-Come on!
-Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?

233
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,699
All right.

234
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,501
"It was summer.

235
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,422
And it was hot.

236
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,216
-Rachel was there.
-Eh?

237
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,222
A lonely gray couch.

238
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,767
'Oh, look!' cried Ned.

239
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,563
And then the kingdom was his forever.
The end!"

240
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,528
That's it? That's all you wrote?
You're the worst writer in the world!

241
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,448
This isn't funny anymore.

242
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,660
There's something about me
on that piece of paper, and I want to see it.

243
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,662
No, you don't.

244
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:55,418
All right, you know what? Fine.
If you guys wanna be children, that's fine.

245
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,836
-I do not need to see it!
-Ha!

246
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,129
No, no, no!

247
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,922
Go, go, go!

248
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,718
Ooh.

249
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:04,969
What is this?

250
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,220
That is....

251
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,722
-No, no, no.
-Ah....

252
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:08,973
Ross, what is this?

253
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,434
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

254
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,648
Okay. Just remember how crazy
I am about you, okay?

255
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,983
"Kind of ditzy"?

256
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,319
Ahem. "Too into her looks"?

257
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,780
"Spoiled"?

258
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,491
A little spoiled. He was supposed
to type "little," the idiot!

259
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,953
"Just a waitress"?

260
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,123
Now, that was, uh....

261
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,959
I mean, as opposed to, uh....

262
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,296
The, um.... Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

263
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,342
Ah! I do not have chubby ankles!

264
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,843
No! I- No. Rach, Rach....

265
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,263
Okay, look at the other side.
Look at Julie's column.

266
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,516
"She's not Rachem"?

267
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,976
-No-
-What the hell's a Rachem?

268
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,771
-No, no-
-Is that some stupid paleontology word...

269
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,357
...that I wouldn't know
because I'm just a waitress?

270
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,609
No. Rach, come on! Rach-

271
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,444
Rach! Rach! No, no!

272
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,780
It's "She's not Rachel"!
She's not....

273
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,452
Rachel?

274
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,667
My diary. My diary! That's brilliant!

275
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,878
If I'd said it was my diary,
she wouldn't have made me read it.

276
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:26,259
No, that's true. You'd be a great person
to have around the day after an emergency.

277
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,637
I cannot believe Ross
even made this list.

278
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,723
-I know.
-What a dinkus!

279
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,602
Hey, cut him some slack.
It was Chandler's idea.

280
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,187
-What?
-What?

281
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,982
Oh, good. I was hoping
that would come up.

282
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,442
-This was your idea?
-What?

283
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:48,197
Let's get some perspective here, okay?
These things happen for a reason.

284
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,574
Yeah. You!

285
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,746
All right, Pheebs, back me up here.
You believe in that karma crap, don't you?

286
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,834
Yeah. Listen, by the way, good luck
in your next life as a dung beetle.

287
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,770
Rach! Whoa--

288
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,355
Rach!

289
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,025
Hey! Uh, open up! Please?

290
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:28,154
When somebody does not buzz you in,
Ross, that means, "Go away."

291
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,698
That doesn't mean,
"Climb up the fire escape."

292
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,451
I just want to read you something,
your "Pro List."

293
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,244
Not interested.

294
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,871
Okay, okay.

295
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,374
"Number one: the way you cry
at game shows. Aw.

296
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,337
Number two: how much you
love your friends.

297
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:48,591
Number three: the way you play
with your hair when you're nervous.

298
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:52,678
Number four: how brave you are
for starting your life over.

299
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,057
Number five: how great you
are with Ben.

300
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,602
Number six: the way you smell."

301
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,313
What are you doing?

302
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,398
Joey, you wanna open the window?

303
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,526
Oh, yeah.

304
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,570
-What are you doing out there?
-I'm, um....

305
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,281
My gosh, you must be freezing.
You know what you need?

306
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,077
How about a nice, steaming
cup of hot Mockolate?

307
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,957
Rach, come on, open up.

308
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,294
Rach, come on. Come on.
You gotta give me another chance.

309
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,213
No.

310
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,549
-No?
-That's what I said.

311
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,925
Maybe we should go.

312
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,219
No, you don't have to go.
We're done talking.

313
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,012
Rach, come on.
I know how you must-

314
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,931
No, you don't, Ross.

315
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:41,435
Imagine the worst things
you think about yourself.

316
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,898
Now, how would you feel if the one person
that you trusted the most in the world...

317
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,775
...not only thinks them too...

318
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:51,988
...but actually uses them
as reasons not to be with you.

319
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,617
No, but see, I wanna be with you
in spite of all those things.

320
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,162
Oh. Well, that's mighty big of you, Ross.

321
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,039
I said, don't go!

322
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,210
You know what?

323
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:11,340
If things were the other way around,
there is nothing you could put on a list...

324
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,302
...that would ever make me
not wanna be with you.

325
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,222
Well, then I guess that's
the difference between us.

326
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,058
See, I'd never make a list.

327
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,078
I never know how long you're supposed to
wait in this situation before you can talk.

328
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,665
Maybe a little longer.

329
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,341
In some of these recipes,
the quantities may seem a little unusual.

330
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,427
Uh, like these coconut Mockolate
holiday nut bars?

331
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,805
I've indicated four cups of coconut
and four cups of crushed nuts...

332
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,225
...and only one tablespoon
of Mockolate.

333
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,436
Doesn't matter.

334
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,771
What?

335
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,398
Our FDA approval didn't come through.

336
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,526
Something about laboratory rats.
Huh.

337
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,904
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

338
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,405
Yeah.

339
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,407
Well, anyhoo, here's your check.

340
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,202
Thank you for all
you went through.

341
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,624
Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it
while you were cooking, did you?

342
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,376
Well, I ate some.

343
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,836
Oh, some. That's fine. Some's not a lot.

344
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,421
-Ha-ha-ha.
-Okay.

345
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,591
So it doesn't burn
when you pee, does it?

346
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,897
Hello.

347
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,190
Hi.

348
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,819
Is that him again?

349
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,781
Tell him I'd come to the phone,
but my ankles are weighing me down.

350
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,619
Listen, I don't think this is the best time.

351
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,789
Look, can you do something for me?

352
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,916
Sure. What?

353
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,419
Okay.

354
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,921
All right.

355
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,467
Music?

356
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,886
-Sure.
-Okay.

357
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,854
<i>The next one's dedicated
to Rachel from Ross.</i>

358
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,857
<i>Rachel, he wants you to know
he's sorry for what he did...</i>

359
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,277
<i>...and he hopes you can
find it in your heart to forgive him.</i>

360
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:40,865
<i>See the stone set in your eyes</i>

361
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,952
<i>See the thorn twist in your side</i>

362
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:49,248
<i>/'// wait for you</i>

363
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,548
<i>Sleight of hand and twist of fate</i>

364
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:03,137
<i>On a bed of nails she makes me wait</i>

365
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:07,558
<i>And I'll wait without you</i>

366
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,810
<i>Uh, we've just gotten a call
from Rachel...</i>

367
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,688
<i>...and she told us what Ross did.</i>

368
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,816
<i>It's pretty appalling.
And, Ross, if you're listening...</i>

369
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,153
<i>.../ don't wanna play
your song anymore.</i>

370
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,369
<i>Why don't we devote our time
to a couple that stands a chance?</i>

371
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,039
<i>Avery, Michelle's sorry
she hit you with her car...</i>

372
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,333
<i>...and she hopes you two
will work it out.</i>

373
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,045
<i>There's a room where</i>

374
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,590
<i>/ can go and</i>

375
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:45,179
<i>Tell my secrets to</i>

00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:50,392
<i>In my room</i>

377
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,564
<i>In my room</i>

378
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:02,571
<i>In my room, in my room</i>

379
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,616
<i>In my room</i>

380
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,576
Hi.

381
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,078
Thanks for coming in again.

382
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,747
Oh, not at all. I have no morals,
and I need the cash.

383
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,083
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
Ha-ha-ha.

384
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,420
Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios.

385
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,132
Now, they taste exactly
like pistachios...

386
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,468
...but they're made
of reconstituted fish bits.

387
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,429
Here, try one.

388
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,683
-All right.
-You're not allergic to anything?

389
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,978
-Uh, cat hair.
-Oh, sorry.
