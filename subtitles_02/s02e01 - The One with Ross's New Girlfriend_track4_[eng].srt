1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,052
<i>Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.</i>

2
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,518
Oh, my God.

3
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,478
Oh, my God.

4
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,399
Oh, my-Excuse me. Move, move,
move! Emergency, please!

5
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,025
Excuse me, excuse me.

6
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,909
-Rach!
-Ah!

7
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,536
There you are!

8
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,621
-Hey!
-Hi!

9
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,833
Oh! So, so.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,794
How was China? You!

11
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,339
It was- It was great.
Oh, what happened?

12
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,258
-What? I am?
-You're bleeding.

13
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,051
-God.
-Oh, look at that! Yes, I am. Heh.

14
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,305
Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!

15
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,142
Come on, I wanna hear everything.
Everything!

16
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,104
Well, uh, where do I start? Um....

17
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,442
This is Julie.
Uh, Julie, this is Rachel.

18
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,278
Hi. Heh.

19
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,488
Uh, oh! These are....

20
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,283
-These are- Aren't for you.
-Oh.

21
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,286
Heh. Uh, these are for you.

22
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,331
Welcome to our country.

23
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,711
Thank you. I'm from New York.

24
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,717
Well, not a problem.
We'll use them to stop the bleeding.

25
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,845
Okay. Uh, baggage claim?

26
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,513
-Okay.
-Okay.

27
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,480
-No way.
-I'm telling you, she went to the airport.

28
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,440
And she's gonna go for it with Ross.

29
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:32,653
Oh, my God. This is huge. This....

30
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,072
This is bigger than huge.
This is....

31
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,324
All right, what's bigger than huge?

32
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,869
-Um, this?
-Yes.

33
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,455
Guys, you got new haircuts!

34
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,791
Yes, yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

35
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,752
Because, you know:

36
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,254
"If you don't look good,
we don't look good."

37
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,507
I love that voice! Ha, ha.

38
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,510
-You guys!
-Oh, oh.

39
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,096
Airport. Airport. Ross.

40
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,764
Not- Not alone.

41
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,059
Julie. Arm around her!

42
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,896
Unh! Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

43
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,691
Okay, I think she's trying
to tell us something.

44
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,026
Quick, get the verbs.

45
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,445
-Ow.
-You! You!

46
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,114
You said he liked me!

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,824
You! You-!

48
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,451
You slowpokes!

49
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,496
That's all right, Rach.
We got the bags. Uh....

50
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,581
Hi. Hello.

51
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,794
Julie, this is my sister, Monica.
This is Chandler.

52
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,879
-Hey.
-Phoebe, hi. Mwah.

53
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,965
-Joey, what up?
-Hey.

54
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,719
-Everyone, this is Julie.
-Julie.

55
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,179
Oh.

56
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,933
Hi!

57
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,185
Hi! But I'm not here,
you haven't met me.

58
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,897
I'll make a better impression when
I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

59
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,066
-And bus.
-Oh, my God!

60
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,444
-With the screaming guy-
-And the spitting.

61
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,737
You gotta hear this story.

62
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,031
We're on this bus
that's 200 years old.

63
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,867
Two hundred, at least.

64
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,495
-And this guy-
-And the chicken poops in her lap! Ha!

65
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,836
Oh, I'm so sorry.

66
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,213
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?

67
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,674
Ugh, I just heard this story in the cab...

68
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,678
...and it is all I can think about.

69
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,808
This is amazing. I mean, how-?

70
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,061
-How did this happen?
-Ross and I were in grad school together.

71
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,482
We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China...

72
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,943
-...guess who's in charge of the dig?
-Julie!

73
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,988
Julie. Isn't that great?

74
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:45,202
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

75
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,331
It's an expression.

76
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,209
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

77
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,961
-Then we're gonna go see the baby.
-Then get some sleep.

78
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,547
Yeah, it's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

79
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,841
Well don't tell us
what's gonna happen, though

80
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,801
Because I like to be surprised.

81
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,724
-Bye!
-Bye.

82
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,487
-Rach. Can I get some coffee? Thank you.
-Sure.

83
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,364
-Hey, Rach-
-Did you talk to him yet?

84
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,449
-No.
-Then, no.

85
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,339
So, what the hell happened
to you in China?

86
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,676
I mean, when last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.

87
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,095
I know. I know I was.

88
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,931
But there was always this voice
inside that kept saying:

89
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,185
"It's never gonna happen. Move on."
You know whose voice that was?

90
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,271
God?

91
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,857
It was you, pal.

92
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,693
Well, maybe it was God doing me.

93
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:05,115
You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.

94
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,993
And then I met Julie, and....

95
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,995
I don't know. We're having a great time.

96
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:14,457
I never would have gone for it with her,
if it hadn't been for you.

97
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,295
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

98
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,423
-Here's your lemonade.
-I didn't order lemonade.

99
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,509
Oh. Well then you better go
take that back.

100
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,261
They're gonna charge you for that.

101
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,930
-But-
-Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

102
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,226
Okay, so, uh, what did you find out?

103
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,520
He said....

104
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,063
He said....

105
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,527
He said they're having a great time.

106
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,030
-I'm sorry.
-What?

107
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,866
But the silver lining,
if you wanna see it...

108
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,494
...is that he made this decision
all by himself...

109
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,664
...without any outside help whatsoever.

110
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,834
How is that a silver lining?

111
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,629
You have to really wanna see it.

112
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,095
Ironically, these guys
were picked last in gym.

113
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,765
Hey, Pheebs.

114
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,809
-You know what I'm thinking?
-Oh, okay.

115
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,357
How...

116
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,234
...it's been so long
since you've had sex...

117
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,946
...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

118
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,742
No. Although now
that's what I'm thinking.

119
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,870
So, what were you thinking?

120
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,498
I was thinking
you gave the guys great haircuts.

121
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,208
I thought you'd like to do mine.

122
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,085
Oh! No.

123
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,339
-Why not?
-Because I'm just....

124
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:48,051
I'm incredibly anal and
an unbelievable control freak.

125
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,761
No, you're not.

126
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,805
I know I'm not, but you are.

127
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,099
I was trying to spare your feelings.

128
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,061
Hello? Oh, hi.

129
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,106
Yeah, hold on a second.
Ross, Julie for you.

130
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,444
Hello? Hi.

131
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,781
Hey. Anybody know a good tailor?

132
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,991
-You need clothes altered?
-No, no.

133
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,869
I'm just looking for a man
to draw on me with chalk.

134
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,915
Go see Frankie. My family's
been going to him forever.

135
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,001
He did my first suit when I was 15.

136
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,545
No, wait, 16.

137
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:27,382
No, excuse me, heh, 15.

138
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,844
All right, when was 1990?

139
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,015
Okay, you have to stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance.

140
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,443
Okay. Okay.
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

141
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,654
Okay, bye. What?

142
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,450
Oh, that is so sweet.

143
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,995
No- Ha, ha.

144
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,247
No. Okay. No, you hang up.

145
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,124
No, you- Okay.

146
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,961
Okay. One, two, three.

147
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,005
Shh.

148
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,967
Well you didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up.

149
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,682
Okay, no. No, you hang up.

150
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,602
You. You. Yo—

151
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,613
Sorry, I thought
you were talking to me.

152
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,366
-Rachel. Heh.
-Sorry.

153
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,786
-I'll just call her back.
-Okay.

154
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,372
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected.

155
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,832
No, you hang up.

156
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,335
Okay, okay, okay.
How did this happen to me? How?

157
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,338
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

158
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,299
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

159
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:55,011
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...

160
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,766
...ugh, this really great guy
that I can't have.

161
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,268
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

162
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,603
I know you did.

163
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,149
Ugh. I'm just gonna deal with it.
I'm just gonna deal with it

164
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,571
I gotta get out of here!

165
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,036
I don't care what you guys say.
Something's bothering her.

166
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,128
You know, I think I was 16.

167
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,049
Please, just a little bit off the back.

168
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,551
Um, I'm still on "no."

169
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,930
-Uh, morning.
-Hey.

170
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,099
Could you close your eyes for a sec?

171
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,435
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for that again.

172
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,108
-What's going on?
-I sort of did a stupid thing last night.

173
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,068
What stupid thing did you do?

174
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,864
Ew!

175
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,539
Why don't you just go get dressed...

176
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,209
...then you'll be on your way.
Bye-bye.

177
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,045
Rachel, how did this happen?

178
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,548
I don't know,
I kind of ran into him last night.

179
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,091
-Where?
-At his apartment.

180
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,801
Is this juice?

181
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:21,181
Whoa. And the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

182
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,475
Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

183
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,896
Honey, you're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

184
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,440
Yeah. People do stupid things
when they're upset.

185
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,693
My God, if I had a nickel
for every guy I wish I hadn't-

186
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,325
But this is about your horrible mistake.

187
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,912
-Hi.
-Hey!

188
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,247
-Hi....
-Sorry we're late.

189
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,665
We were, uh....

190
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,168
Well, there was touching.

191
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,548
-Hey-!
-Oh.

192
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,218
-Hey, Ross!
-Paolo. Ha.

193
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,719
What a....

194
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,306
What, uh-?
What are you doing here?

195
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,308
-I do Raquel.
-Ah.

196
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,483
So, uh, he's back?

197
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,235
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?

198
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,862
No, not a problem.

199
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,365
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

200
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,910
Okay, you're gonna
have to not touch my ass.

201
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:31,459
Well, despite the yummy bagels
and palpable tension...

202
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,586
...I've got pants that need to be altered.

203
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,298
Oh, when you see Frankie,
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

204
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,133
He'll know what it means.

205
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,222
You sure he's gonna be able
to crack that code?

206
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:49,644
It's funny. The last time Paolo was here,
my hair was so much shorter and cuter.

207
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,397
All right. Okay.

208
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:57,068
But- But! You have to promise that you
will not be all controlly and bossy...

209
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,029
...and all, you know, Monica about it.

210
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:01,739
I promise.

211
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,574
All right, let's see.

212
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,912
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

213
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,291
But I promise,
none of you will feel a thing.

214
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,960
Okay.

215
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,391
-All right, that's it. I quit.
-What? I didn't say anything!

216
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:32,311
Yeah, but this isn't the face of
a person who trusts a person.

217
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,398
This is the face of
a person who, you know...

218
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,692
...doesn't trust a person.

219
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,486
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe.

220
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,407
It's just a little shorter
than what we had discussed.

221
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:48,077
Would you relax?
I know what I am doing.

222
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,872
This is how he wears it.

223
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,460
-How who wears it?
-Demi Moore.

224
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,504
Heh. Demi Moore is not a he.

225
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,424
Well, he was a he
in <i>Arthur </i>and in <i>10.</i>

226
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,136
That's Dudley Moore!

227
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,097
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

228
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,975
-Oh. Oh!
-Oh, my God!

229
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,145
-Oh, God!
-Oh, my God!

230
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,689
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

231
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,232
Which one is Demi Moore?

232
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,279
She's the actress that was in
<i>Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!</i>

233
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,114
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.

234
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,492
-I know!
-Oh, my God!

235
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,958
How long do you want the cuffs?

236
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,878
At least as long as I have the pants.

237
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,467
I just got that.

238
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,847
Okay. Now we'll do your inseam.

239
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,029
How is she?

240
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,615
It's too soon to tell.

241
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,369
She's resting, which is a good sign.

242
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,289
-How's the hair?
-I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross.

243
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,208
It doesn't look good.

244
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,296
I put a clip on one side, which seems
to have stopped the curling.

245
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,299
Can we see her?

246
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,010
Your hair looks too good.
It would upset her.

247
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,389
Ross, why don't you come on in.

248
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,982
-Well, how you doing?
-I'm okay.

249
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,609
-Ooh, that bad, huh?
-What?

250
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,280
Look, I can sense when women
are depressed and vulnerable.

251
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,949
It's one of my gifts. Sit.

252
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,785
Ugh.

253
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,957
Ugh, Joey, when I saw him
get off that plane with her...

254
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,419
...I really thought I just hit rock bottom.

255
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:05,131
But today, it's like there's rock bottom...

256
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,258
...50 feet of crap...

257
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,343
...then me.

258
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,929
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.

259
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,224
Oh, come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?

260
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,269
What about her? They've only
been going out for two weeks.

261
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,731
Ross has been in love
with you for 10 years.

262
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,109
-I don't know. I don't know.
-Look, Rach, Rach.

263
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,695
I've been with my share of women.

264
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,240
I've been with a lot
of people's share of women.

265
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,826
But the point is...

266
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,122
...I've never felt about anyone
the way Ross felt about you.

267
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,667
Really?

268
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,092
Yo, paisan.

269
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,805
Can I talk to you for a sec?

270
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,810
Your tailor...

271
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,396
...is a very bad man!

272
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,735
-Frankie? What are you talking about?
-Hey, what's going on?

273
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,450
Joey's tailor...

274
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,830
...took advantage of me.

275
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,042
-What?
-No way.

276
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,545
I've been going to the guy for 12 years.

277
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,880
Oh, come on.
He said he was gonna do my inseam.

278
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,717
Then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite-

279
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,302
What?

280
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,471
Cupping.

281
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,143
That's how they do pants!

282
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,231
First they go up one side,
they move it over.

283
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:49,485
Then they go up the other side,
move it back, then they do the rear.

284
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,366
What? Ross, tell him.
Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?

285
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,618
Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

286
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,752
What's the matter with you?

287
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,379
What?

288
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,259
That's not?

289
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,975
Oh, my God.

290
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,276
Even Mary Tyler Moore
would've been better.

291
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,363
I like it.

292
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,198
Yeah, I do. I think it's a 10!

293
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,580
Thank you. My hair is very amused.

294
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,499
Oh, come on, things could be worse.
I mean, uh....

295
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,419
You could "get caught between
the moon and New York City.

296
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,840
I know it's crazy, but it's true."

297
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,261
Thank you.

298
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,597
-Well, I gotta go. Bye.
-See you.

299
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,057
Bye, Rach!

300
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,892
Wait, are you leaving?

301
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,519
That's what I meant by "bye."

302
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,855
Well, uh, can I talk to you for a sec?

303
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,482
Okay.

304
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,779
When the doctor does
that hernia test....

305
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,073
That's okay.

306
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,328
-What's going on?
-Urn....

307
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,916
-Well, um, okay, first of all...
-Mm-hm.

308
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,002
...Paolo and I are not back together.

309
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,962
That was a stupid thing I did.

310
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,299
If I could go back in time
and do it again...

311
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,635
...well, I wouldn't.

312
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,762
-Ahem.
-Urn....

313
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,972
-Heh.
-Second of all....

314
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,558
What?

315
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,229
Before I say anything...

316
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,232
...is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy.

317
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,858
Then I tell you what I think...

318
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,444
...and the next day
you get back together with him...

319
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,447
-...and I look like a complete idiot?
-No, no, no.

320
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,992
Okay. Um, well, then,
I think the guy's scum.

321
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,622
I hate him. I mean, I actually-
I physically hate him.

322
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,166
You know? I always have.

323
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:13,337
And you are way too good
to be with a guy like that.

324
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,756
-Really?
-Rach?

325
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,551
You deserve to be with someone
who appreciates you...

326
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,011
...and who gets how funny...

327
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,681
...and sweet and amazing...

328
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,976
...and adorable and sexy you are.

329
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,771
You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking:

330
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,650
"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!" Heh.

331
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,737
You know? Someone
who makes you feel good.

332
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,072
Like the way I do with Julie.

333
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,330
Was there a "second of all"?

334
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,709
Urn....

335
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:57,131
No, um, I think that was the whole "all."

336
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,968
I gotta go. Okay?

337
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,637
-Okay.
-Thanks.

338
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,848
Okay.

339
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,189
No, I swear to God, Dad!

340
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,483
That's not how they measure pants!

341
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,494
I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

342
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,537
-Oh, yeah. Oh, I could do that.
-Really?

343
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,248
-Yeah. You wanna do it now?
-Great!

344
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,125
-Okay.
-Okay.

345
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,877
See you.

346
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,588
Okay, I just wanna make
really sure this time.

347
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:38,839
Uh-huh. Ahem.

348
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:43,344
Andie MacDowell is the girl from
<i>Four Weddings and a Funeral, </i>right?

349
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,471
No.

350
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,393
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's Roddy McDowall.

351
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,356
Andie MacDowell is the guy
from <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

352
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,150
-Oh! Yeah, okay.
-Yeah. Okay?

353
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,236
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
