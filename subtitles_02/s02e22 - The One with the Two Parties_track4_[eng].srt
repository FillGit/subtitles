1
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,552
So I'll get candles
and my mom's lace tablecloth.

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,222
Since it's Rachel's birthday
and we want it to be special...

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,599
-...I thought I'd poach a salmon.
-Oh.

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,100
What?

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,562
Question: Why do we always have to
have parties where you poach things?

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,148
You wanna be in charge
of the food committee?

7
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:26,401
Question two: Why do we always
have parties with committees?

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,737
Yeah, yeah.
Why can't we just get some pizzas...

9
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,948
-...and gets some beers and have fun?
-Yeah.

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,659
Yeah, I agree. You know,
I think fancy parties are only fun...

11
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,870
...if you're fancy on the inside,
and I'm just not sure we are.

12
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,666
All right.
You guys don't want it to be special?

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,502
Fine. You can throw
any kind of party you want.

14
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,463
-Joey, they're not real.
-Huh? Huh.

15
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,884
I start miles beneath the surface
of these things, okay? They're fake.

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,594
See? Honk, honk.

17
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,349
Wow, it's like porno for clowns.

18
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,485
I talked to Rachel's sisters.
Neither of them can come.

19
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,156
Okay, so I still have to invite Dylan
and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

20
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,533
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh, no Shannon Cooper.

21
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,118
Why not her?

22
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,204
Because she, uh.... She steals stuff.

23
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,292
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff...

24
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,629
...and Joey slept with her
and never called her back.

25
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,508
-Joey, that is horrible.
-Hey, I liked her.

26
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,012
All right? Maybe too much. I don't know.

27
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,473
I guess I just got scared.

28
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,392
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

29
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,146
Heh. I didn't think anyone
would buy that. Okay.

30
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,234
-Hi, honey. How did it go?
-Ugh. It was the graduation from hell.

31
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,571
You know, my cousin went to hell
on a football scholarship.

32
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,949
You know, I mean, this is supposed to be
a joyous occasion.

33
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,328
My sister's graduating from college.
Nobody thought she would.

34
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,582
It's a true testament to what a girl
from Long Island would do for a Celica.

35
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,002
-So, what happened?
-My parents happened.

36
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,297
All they had to do was sit
in the same stadium, smile proudly...

37
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,550
...and not talk about the divorce. But no.

38
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,637
They got into a huge fight in the middle
of the commencement address.

39
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:02,724
Bishop Tutu actually
had to stop and shush them.

40
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,395
Ugh. But you know what?
You know what the good news is?

41
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,438
I get to serve coffee
for the next eight hours.

42
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,652
Okay, so I guess
we don't invite her parents.

43
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,363
-Well, how about just her mom?
-Why her mom?

44
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,699
Because I already invited her.

45
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,284
Ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?

46
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,744
Uh, can't invite her.

47
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,957
She also steals.

48
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,800
Okay, here are the candles.
Where's the birthday cake?

49
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,846
Okay, we're not having birthday cake.
We're having birthday flan.

50
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,141
Excuse me?

51
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,309
It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.

52
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,019
Whoa, that's nice.

53
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,856
Happy birthday, Rachel.
Here's some goo.

54
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,197
Dr. Green.

55
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,324
Oh, my God. It's Rachel's dad.

56
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,287
What are you doing here?

57
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,206
What, the father can't drop by to see
the daughter on her birthday?

58
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,292
No, no, the father can.

59
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,212
But, um, since I am the roommate,
I can tell you that she's not here.

60
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,339
And I'll pass along the message.
Okay? So bye-bye.

61
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,343
Oh. You're having a party.

62
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,179
No, no, not a party.

63
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,766
Just a surprise gathering
of some people Rachel knows.

64
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,811
-Uh, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
-I'll never remember all of that.

65
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,481
So, uh, what's the deal?

66
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,401
Rachel comes home, people pop out
and yell stuff? Is that it?

67
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,862
This isn't your first
surprise party, is it, sir?

68
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,576
Hi, Monica.

69
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,373
The Chinese menu guy.
Forgot the menus.

70
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,710
So basically, just a Chinese guy.

71
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,799
Hey, Dr. Green, come with me.
We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

72
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,888
All right.
That sounds like a two-person job.

73
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,435
Well, my goodness. What was that?

74
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,896
Sandra, I am so sorry.
I thought you were Rachel.

75
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,648
And we weren't ready for you yet.

76
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,610
-You thought I was Rachel?
-Yes, because, uh, you look so young.

77
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,404
And because you're both,
you know, white women.

78
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,201
Oh, I missed you kids.

79
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,370
Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?

80
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,913
No.

81
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,542
-No, I'll take that for you.
-Oh, well, thank you.

82
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,378
-Okay.
-Such a gentleman. Thank you.

83
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,880
Oh.

84
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,635
Oh, it all looks so nice.
So festive. All the balloons.

85
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,931
Oh, the funniest thing happened
to me on the way here.

86
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,559
-I was driving-
-That's great. Ha-ha-ha.

87
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:57,107
I can't wait to hear the rest,
but I have to go to the bathroom.

88
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,109
So- Hey, come with me.

89
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,903
-What?
-Yeah, yeah. It will be like we're gal pals.

90
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,906
You know, like at a restaurant.
Oh, it'll be fun. Come on.

91
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,283
Ha, ha. Come on.

92
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,374
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Okay, think. Think.

93
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,668
What would Jack and Chrissy do?

94
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,215
Okay, now that your coat
is safely in the bed-

95
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,676
Okay. We can come back out
in the living room. Ha, ha.

96
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:29,306
So, Joey and Chandler, I think it's time
that you take Dr. Green over to your place.

97
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,057
Uh, yes, absolutely.

98
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,643
Um, why, again?

99
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,522
Because that's where
the party is, you goon.

100
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,775
See, this is just the staging area.

101
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,278
-Right, it's the staging area.
-This is the staging area.

102
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,323
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.

103
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:55,540
All right, you guys are off
to party number one.

104
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,712
And you....
You are off to party number two.

105
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,549
All right, fellas, let's keep it moving,
let's keep it moving.

106
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,304
Chandler, could you at least
send some women to my party.

107
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,975
Okay, that's Ross. All right.

108
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,144
Okay, they're coming. Shh!

109
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,612
Thank you for such a wonderful dinner.

110
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,656
Thanks for being born.

111
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,617
Oh, thank you for my beautiful earrings.
They're perfect.

112
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,452
-Aw.
-I love you.

113
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,956
Oh. Now, you can exchange them
if you want, okay?

114
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,417
Hmm. Now I love you even more.

115
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,549
Surprise!

116
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,010
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

117
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,222
Oh, Monica. Oh, my God. Mom.

118
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,723
This is so great.

119
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,976
Happy birthday, sweetie.

120
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,355
Wow. You. I had no idea.

121
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,648
-Really?
-No, I knew.

122
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,191
All right.

123
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,611
Everybody, there's food and drinks
on the table.

124
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,113
-Go across the hall.
-What?

125
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,656
Right now, Joey and Chandler's. Go.

126
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,533
-Why?
-Just go.

127
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,829
-Weird.
-Surprise!

128
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,584
Happy birthday, sweet pea.

129
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,670
Daddy! Ha, ha.

130
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,261
Both of them are here? Both of them?
Both of them are here?

131
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,929
Well, we could count again?

132
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,392
-I can't believe this is happening.
-You know what? This is ridiculous.

133
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,103
Okay, this is your birthday,
this is your party.

134
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,648
I say we just put them all together.
If they can't deal with it, who cares?

135
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,234
-I do.
-That's who.

136
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,154
Look, are you gonna be okay?

137
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,364
Well, I have to be.
I don't really have a choice.

138
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,324
I mean, I can look at the bright side.

139
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,286
I get two birthday parties
and two birthday cakes.

140
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,415
Well, actually just one birthday flan.

141
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,254
-What?
-It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.

142
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,132
Look, talk to Monica.
She's on the food committee.

143
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,559
Joe, Joe, hey, some girl just walked up
to me and said, "I want you, Dennis"...

144
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,353
...and stuck her tongue down my throat.

145
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,355
I love this party.

146
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,108
-Quick volleyball question.
-Volleyball.

147
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,027
Yeah, we set up a court in your room.

148
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,030
Uh, you didn't like that gray lamp,
did you?

149
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,116
Joey, a woman just stuck her tongue
down my throat.

150
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,327
I'm not even listening to you.

151
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,955
-Dennis.
-Okay, that's me.

152
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,917
Listen, ahem, honey,
can you keep Dad occupied?

153
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,877
I'm gonna go talk to Mom for a while.

154
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,630
Okay, do you have any ideas
for any openers?

155
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,717
Uh, let's just stay clear of "I'm the guy
that's doing your daughter"...

156
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,969
...and you should be okay.

157
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,098
Okay, people, I want you
to take a piece of paper-

158
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,144
Here you go. And write down
your most embarrassing memory.

159
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,897
And I do ask that when
you're not using the markers...

160
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,108
...you put the caps back on them...

161
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,735
...because they will dry out.

162
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,071
Hi, Dr. Green.

163
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,325
So how's everything in the, uh...

164
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,912
...vascular surgery game?

165
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,667
It's not a game, Ross.
A woman died on my table today.

166
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,836
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,214
See, that's the good thing about my job.

168
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,385
All the dinosaurs on my table
are already dead.

169
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,473
Listen, you guys, um,
I don't mean to be a pain about this...

170
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,852
...but, um, I've noticed that some of you
are just placing them on.

171
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,979
You want to push the caps...

172
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,983
...until you hear them click.

173
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,695
Gunther. Where you going?

174
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,573
I, uh, was sort of thinking
about maybe-

175
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,868
No. No, you can't go. No, this is fun.

176
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,496
Come on, come on, we're just
getting started. Here's your marker.

177
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,834
Listen, if you want to go, just go.

178
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,753
No. She'll yell at me again.

179
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,842
All right, ahem, I can get you out.

180
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,468
What?

181
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,720
Shh.

182
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,431
In a minute,
I'm gonna create a diversion.

183
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,225
When I do, walk quickly to the door
and don't look back.

184
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,355
-I think I need a drink.
-Oh, I'll get it for you.

185
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,608
-What do you want?
-Scotch.

186
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:36,196
All right, I'll be back in 10 seconds
with your Scotch on the rocks in a glass.

187
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,739
Neat.

188
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,699
-Cool.
-No, no, no.

189
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,827
Neat, as in no rocks.

190
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,371
Hen. I know.

191
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,127
Oh, hello, Ross.
Now, where have you been?

192
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:55,381
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom.

193
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,218
Ahem. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

194
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,475
Oh. Scotch neat.

195
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,852
You know, that's Rachel's father's drink.

196
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,604
Oh. Huh.

197
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,357
Mine too. Isn't that neat?

198
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,317
Scotch neat.

199
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,572
Would you excuse me?

200
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,453
Hey. Hey.

201
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,373
Where are you sneaking off to, mister?
Heh.

202
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,959
I'm getting my cigarettes
out of my jacket.

203
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,002
-No.
-No. What do you mean "no"?

204
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,631
No, um, see,
because that's the staging area.

205
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,385
You go in there, it'll ruin
the whole illusion of the party.

206
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,554
Yeah, I think, you take your Scotch
back in there...

207
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,141
...and I will get your cigarettes
for you, sir.

208
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,603
-And get my glasses too.
-All righty-roo.

209
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,318
What a great moment to say that
for the first time.

210
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,993
Okay, the first person's
most embarrassing memory is:

211
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,620
"Monica, your party sucks."

212
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,123
All right. Very funny.

213
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,543
Oh, no. Ooh.
Did someone forget to use a coaster?

214
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,253
What?

215
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,970
I don't see anything.

216
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,348
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

217
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,603
Ross, whose glasses are those?

218
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,772
Mine.

219
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,859
You wear bifocals?

220
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,360
Mm-hm.

221
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,989
I have a condition apparently...

222
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,241
...that I require...

223
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,078
...two different sets of focals.

224
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,874
Do you know my husband
has glasses just like that?

225
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,210
-Oh.
-Well, those are very popular frames.

226
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,755
Neil Sedaka wears them.

227
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,385
I hear you can get people out of here.

228
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,889
-Rachel?
-Yeah?

229
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,142
You didn't tell me
your boyfriend smokes.

230
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,644
Yeah, like a chimney.

231
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,230
Big smoker.

232
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,150
Big, big smoker.

233
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:23,488
In fact, I'm gonna go out into the hallway
and fire up this bad boy.

234
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,878
Are you wearing my glasses?

235
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,798
Yes.

236
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,887
I was just warming up
the earpieces for you.

237
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,139
Thank you.

238
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,643
Is that one of my cigarettes?

239
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,274
Yeah.

240
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,779
Yes, it is. I was just moistening the tip.

241
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:10,034
Okay, okay. She's taking the trash out,
so I can get you out of here.

242
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,578
But it has to be now.
She'll be back any minute.

243
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,913
What about my friend Victor?

244
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,625
No, only the three of you. Any more
than that and she'll get suspicious.

245
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,461
-All right. Let me just get my coat.
-There isn't time.

246
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,465
Just leave everything.

247
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,093
They'll take care of you next door.

248
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,679
Is it true they have beer?

249
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,849
Everything you've heard is true.

250
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,352
Could you guys please
try and keep it down?

251
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,272
We're trying to start
a Boggle tournament.

252
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,696
You. And you.

253
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:50,992
You're supposed to be at my party.
And Gunther.

254
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,081
What are you doing here?

255
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,791
Um....

256
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,879
Hey, welcome to the fo—

257
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,674
Phoebe?

258
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,760
All right, I'm sorry.
But these people needed me.

259
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,263
You know, they work hard all week.
It's Saturday night.

260
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,807
They deserve to have a little fun. Go.

261
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,727
You know, my party is fun.

262
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,646
I mean, maybe it's a little quieter,
less obvious sort of fun.

263
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,025
But, you know, if people
would just give it a chance, it's—

264
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:32,742
-You want me to see a therapist?
-Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem.

265
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,704
You've chosen a boyfriend
exactly like your father.

266
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,790
Okay, Mom, you know what? Fine.
I'll make an appointment.

267
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,377
Okay? But you know what?
Right now, I gotta go. I gotta go do a thing.

268
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:48,382
Did you know your mother
spent $1200 on bonsai trees?

269
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,427
I felt like Gulliver around that place.

270
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,763
Daddy, Daddy,
I really want to hear more about this...

271
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,892
...I really do,
but I just have to do, uh, some stuff.

272
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,145
You work and you work
and you work at a marriage...

273
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,731
...but all he cares about
is his stupid boat.

274
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,817
You work and you work
and you work on a boat.

275
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,904
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.

276
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,073
And you sand it and you varnish it.

277
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,910
But when all is said and done,
he still drinks out of the mugs.

278
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,205
One night of her yoga
and her <i>Bridges of Madison County....</i>

279
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,291
<i>-Scotch, cigarettes....
-Bonsais, the Chihuahua....</i>

280
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,669
<i>I've only been in therapy
three weeks now but-</i>

281
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,338
<i>What the hell does she
want with half a boat?</i>

282
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,887
Okay, okay, okay,
you can be shirts and I'll be skins.

283
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,682
I'll be skins.

284
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,562
Hey.

285
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,731
How you holding up there, tiger?

286
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:51,696
Oh. Sorry. When my parents were getting
divorced, I got a lot of "tigers."

287
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:56,075
Ahem. I got a lot of "champs,"
"chiefs," "sports."

288
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,035
Ahem. I even got a "governor."

289
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,916
This is it, isn't it?
I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like.

290
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,502
My mom there, my dad there.

291
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,130
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

292
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:14,010
She gets the house, he's in some condo
my sister's gonna decorate with wicker.

293
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,054
Chandler, how did you get through this?

294
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,559
Well, I relied on a carefully
regimented program...

295
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,936
...of denial...

296
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,731
...and wetting the bed.

297
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,861
You know, I just- It's so weird.

298
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:36,699
I mean, I was in there just listening
to them bitch about each other.

299
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,785
All I kept thinking about
was the Fourth of July.

300
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,372
Because it reminded you of the way...

301
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,875
...our forefathers used
to bitch at each other?

302
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,918
It's just this thing.

303
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:52,381
Every year we would go out
on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks.

304
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:57,053
Mom always hated it because
the ocean air made her hair all big.

305
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,514
My sister Jill would be
throwing up over the side...

306
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,225
...and my dad would be upset
because nobody was helping.

307
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,771
And then when we did help,
he would scream at us for doing it wrong.

308
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,195
But then when the fireworks started,
everybody just shut up.

309
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,947
You know, and it'd get really cold.

310
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,910
And we'd all just sort of
smoosh under this one blanket.

311
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,121
It never occurred to anybody
to bring another one.

312
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,875
And now it's....

313
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,588
Yeah, I know.

314
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,863
<i>Thanks for coming.
I hope you had fun.</i>

315
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,199
All right, Monica, dear,
I'm gonna hit the road.

316
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,285
Now, I've left my 10 verbs on the table.

317
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,788
Yes, and you be sure and send me
that finished poem.

318
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,998
-Okay, will do. So glad you came.
-All right, dear.

319
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,626
-I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
-Okay, let me go check.

320
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,294
Oh, all right.

321
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,965
-Your mom wants to say goodbye.
-Oh, okay.

322
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,259
Happy birthday, sweetie.

323
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,094
Okay.

324
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,555
Uh, you drive safe.

325
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,683
-Okay.
-What are you doing?

326
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:30,479
I'm getting ready for the water skiing.

327
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,940
Okay, big hug. One more. Come on.

328
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,445
How are you?

329
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,532
-Dr. Green. Where are you going?
-To get my coat.

330
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,367
No, no, no.
We'll get that for you.

331
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,370
All right, all right.
I can get my own coat.

332
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,797
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

333
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,261
Oh, no. No, you're not
supposed to be here.

334
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,848
This is the staging area.
It's all wrong. You should leave.

335
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:09,226
Ha, ha. You know, just get out.

336
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,070
Or perhaps you'd like a creme de menthe.

337
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,741
I have to be heading toward my chateau.
Thank you.

338
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,869
All right, well, then I guess
we're going back into the hallway again.

339
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,996
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Green.

340
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,508
Okay.

341
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,427
You take care.

342
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,724
Oh, you kids.

343
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,728
Well.

344
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:57,066
This is the best party
I've been to in years.

345
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,568
Thank you.

346
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,326
Okay, everybody, it's time for flan.

347
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:11,080
Yep. Get ready for the gelatinous fun.

348
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,792
Kind of looks like that stuff you get
when you get a bad infection.

349
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,211
Okay, that's enough.

350
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:20,464
Okay, Rachel, make a special flan wish.

351
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,425
Okay, I've got one.

352
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,973
Heads up.

353
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:34,061
Wow. Those things almost never come true.
