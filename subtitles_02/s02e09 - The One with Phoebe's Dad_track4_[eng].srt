1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:05,839
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:09,510
Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:13,013
Oh, my God, you should see the size
of his Christmas balls!

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,476
-Hey.
-Hey.

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,353
How much did you tip the super?

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,898
Yeah, we were gonna give 50,
but we don't wanna look bad.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,234
Oh, this year
we just made him cookies.

8
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,611
And 25 it is.

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,656
Heh. You gave him cookies?

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,741
-Money is so impersonal.
-Yeah.

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,701
Cookies says someone really cares.

12
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,747
All right, we're broke,
but cookies do say that.

13
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:40,999
I can see that.

14
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,293
A plate of brownies told me a limerick.

15
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:50,050
Pheebs, let me ask you something.
Were these, uh, "funny" brownies?

16
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,511
Not especially.

17
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,180
But, you know,
I think they had pot in them.

18
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,769
So, you guys, who else did you tip
with cookies?

19
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:03,188
Uh, the mailman, the super....

20
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,192
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.

21
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,528
Oh, my God.

22
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,113
What?

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,073
Uh, I don't think you're gonna like this.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,324
Oh, wow.

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,368
Oh, gosh.

26
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,830
Oh, these are cookies
smashed in the Sports section.

27
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,957
And he did my crossword puzzle.

28
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,919
Yeah, but not very well,
unless 14 across, "Gershwin musical"...

29
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:30,257
...actually is "Bite me, bite me, bite me."

30
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,185
I can't believe it's Christmas already.
You know?

31
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,146
One day you're eating turkey,
the next thing you know...

32
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,316
...your lords are a-leaping
and your geese are a-laying. Hen.

33
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:34,946
Which is why geese are
so relaxed this time of year.

34
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,617
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

35
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,994
Hey, Rach.

36
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,081
I, uh, got you a little present.

37
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,959
I'll open it.

38
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,420
It's a Slinky!

39
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,714
Ha, ha. Remember, huh?

40
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,092
<i>Walks downstairs
Alone or in pairs</i>

41
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,135
<i>Everyone knows it's-</i>

42
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,139
Just a big spring.

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,934
You're still mad because of the whole-

44
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,520
Horrible list of reasons not to be with me?

45
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,356
How about we just call it
"the unfortunate incident"?

46
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,737
Hey, Gunther.
You got stairs in your place?

47
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,198
-Yeah.
-Go nuts.

48
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,702
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

49
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,121
What's in the bag?

50
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,498
Mm, just some presents.

51
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,709
Come on, show us what you bought.

52
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,836
You know you want to.

53
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,714
Okay.

54
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,511
This is a picture frame
from Ben to my parents.

55
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,263
Oh, that's cute.

56
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,474
Some "Hers" and "Hers" towels
for Susan and Carol.

57
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,981
And, uh, I got this blouse for Mom.

58
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,233
-Ross, that is gorgeous!
-Yeah?

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,069
Look at these authentic fake medals!

60
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,071
Mom's gonna be voted "best dressed"...

61
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,365
...at the make-believe military academy!

62
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,661
-Hey.
-Hey.

63
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,956
-Happy Christmas Eve Eve.
-You too.

64
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,208
Oh, my God! Where did you get this?

65
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,086
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.

66
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,588
This is my father!

67
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,423
This is a picture of my dad!

68
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,554
Uh, Pheebs, that's the guy
that comes in the frame.

69
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,973
No, it's my dad. I'll show you.

70
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,392
I thought your dad was in prison.

71
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,186
No, that's my stepdad.

72
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,731
My real dad's the one that
ran out on us before I was born.

73
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,900
How have you never been on <i>Oprah?</i>

74
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,820
Look, see? This is him.

75
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,657
My mother gave me this picture
before she died. Same guy!

76
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,371
Honey, uh, this is a picture
of the frame guy...

77
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,249
...posing in front of a blue screen
with a collie.

78
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,669
It's not a blue screen. It's just-

79
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,672
Maybe it was just really clear that day.

80
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,094
Okay, I have to talk to my grandmother.

81
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,306
-Wait a minute, honey!
-Pheebs.

82
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,017
-Whoa.
-Wow.

83
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,063
I'm trying to get my boss's
ex-wife to sleep with me.

84
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,273
Joey.

85
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,693
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem,
everyone's all ears!

86
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,949
Esther Livingston.

87
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,993
Gone!

88
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,705
Urn.... Hi, Pooh.

89
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,166
Hi, Gram. Ahem, what you doing?

90
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,877
Oh, just updating the phone book.

91
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,339
Um, Gram? Urn....

92
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,758
Can I see the pictures of my dad again?

93
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,760
Oh.

94
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,011
Oh, sure, sure.

95
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,639
Uh.... Huh, how come?

96
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,475
Just, you know, to see him.

97
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,644
Oh, sure. Here.

98
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,062
All right, uh....

99
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,232
This is the one
of your father in a meadow.

100
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,820
And, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite.

101
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,448
And here he is at a graduation.

102
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,119
Another graduation.

103
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,707
Another graduation.

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,751
Is this really my father?

105
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,920
Is it really your-?

106
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,549
Well, of course it is.

107
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,720
I smell smoke. Maybe because
someone's pants are on fire!

108
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,847
Well, I....

109
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,891
In all the years we've been
grandmother and granddaughter...

110
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,602
...you've never lied.

111
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,274
All right, that's not your father.
It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

112
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,652
Oh, God.

113
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,655
It was your mother's idea.

114
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,241
She didn't want you
to know your real father...

115
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,368
...because it hurt her so much when he left.

116
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,579
I didn't wanna go along with it.

117
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,124
But then she died
and it was harder to argue with her.

118
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,087
Not impossible, but harder.

119
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,883
All right.
So he's not a famous tree surgeon?

120
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:13,642
And I guess he doesn't live in a hut in Burma
where there's no phones?

121
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,520
Last I heard, he was
a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

122
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,314
That makes no sense.

123
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,651
Why would the villagers
worship a pharmacist?

124
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,279
Honey.

125
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,615
-Oh. Yeah.
-Yeah.

126
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,827
Anyway, that's all I know.

127
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,456
That...

128
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,960
...and this.

129
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,047
This...

130
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,925
...is the real him.

131
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,220
Oh.

132
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,058
I remember my father
all dressed up in the red suit...

133
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,395
...the big black boots
and the patent leather belt...

134
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,648
...sneaking around downstairs.
He didn't want us to see him...

135
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:06,528
...but he'd be drunk, so he'd crash
into something and wake everybody up.

136
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,864
That doesn't sound like
a very merry Christmas.

137
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,242
Who said anything about Christmas?

138
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,872
-Hi.
-Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

139
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,416
No, nothing.

140
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,001
I hope she's okay.

141
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,169
I know exactly what she's going through.

142
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,714
How do you know
what she's going through?

143
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,465
She told us.

144
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,595
What do you got there, Monica?

145
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,055
Stuff for the party.

146
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,142
Aren't you guys supposed to be shopping?

147
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,977
You didn't buy presents yet?

148
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,855
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve!
What are you gonna do?

149
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,025
Don't you have to be Claymation
to say stuff like that?

150
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,863
Oh, by the way, Mon, I don't think
the mailman liked your cookies.

151
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,906
Here are the ornaments your mom sent.

152
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,244
Well....

153
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,582
Maybe the mailman liked the cookies.
We just didn't give him enough.

154
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,793
Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

155
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,094
Hey, Rach. Ahem.

156
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,222
I think I know what will
make you feel better.

157
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,225
How about you make a list about me?

158
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,603
Forget it. I'm not gonna stand here...

159
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,979
...and make a list.

160
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,148
Okay, you're whiny...

161
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,276
...you are obsessive, you are insecure...

162
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,195
-...you're gutless.
-Heh.

163
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,447
You don't ever just seize the day.

164
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,658
You liked me for a year
and you didn't do anything about it.

165
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,078
And, uh.... Oh, you wear
too much of that gel in your hair.

166
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,418
See, there. You, uh....

167
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,170
All right, you did what I said.

168
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,631
-And you know what?
-Hmm?

169
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,591
You're right. I do feel better.

170
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,842
Thank you, Ross.

171
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,436
Yeah, in Albany. Could I have
the number of Frank Buffay?

172
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,565
Okay. Um, in Ithaca?

173
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,902
All right, um, Saratoga?

174
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,404
Oneonta?

175
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,367
You know what?
You shouldn't call yourself Information!

176
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,498
Hey.

177
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:27,544
Hello, Grandma.
If that is, in fact, your real name.

178
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,923
Come on now, Pooh.
Don't still be mad at me.

179
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,385
-How's it going?
-Oh, not so good.

180
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,931
Upstate's pretty big.
He's pretty small. You do the math.

181
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,601
Well, I think you're better off without him.

182
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,563
Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.

183
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,941
But to me,
he's still the irresponsible creep...

184
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,195
...who locked up your mom
and stole her Gremlin.

185
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,367
I know. I just wanted to know
who he was, you know?

186
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,453
Yeah, I know.

187
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,206
Okay.

188
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,711
I wasn't completely honest with you
when I told you that, uh, I didn't know...

189
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,171
...exactly where he lived.

190
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,132
What do you mean?

191
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,386
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown.

192
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,266
If you hit the Dairy Queen,
you've gone too far.

193
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,310
You can take my cab.

194
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,853
Wow.

195
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,313
Thank you.

196
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:33,318
-Nobody else drives that cab.
-Uh-huh. Got it.

197
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,736
Oh.

198
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,238
-I'm gonna see my dad!
-Ha-ha-ha.

199
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,241
-Thank you.
-Oh. Ha, ha.

200
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,868
Mm, okay. Oh.

201
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,370
Wish me luck, Grandpa.

202
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,838
Hey.

203
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,423
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

204
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,259
Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.

205
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,761
Hop in!

206
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,181
She'd better get here. The stores close at 7.

207
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,226
It'll be two hours to Phoebe's dad's house...

208
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,519
...they'll meet, chat, swap life stories.

209
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,355
We'll still have plenty of time.

210
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,733
-Hey, here she comes!
-Hey.

211
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,069
Hey, hey.

212
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,071
Hi.

213
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,699
-Hey.
-Hey.

214
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,451
Can you believe this?

215
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,954
In like two hours I'm gonna have a dad.

216
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,249
Yeah, big stuff.

217
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,875
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

218
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,044
-Here, you have to hold this.
-Okay.

219
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,508
"Brake, left. Gas, right"?

220
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,718
Uh-huh, that's my cheat sheet.

221
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,308
-Where's my seat belt?
-That side doesn't have one.

222
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,186
The paramedics had to cut through it.

223
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,192
-Hey.
-Hey.

224
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,783
Come on, just tell me. Please, please.

225
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,205
For the 16th time,
no, I do not think you're obsessive.

226
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,584
-Oh, it's hot in here!
-Rach, get the heat.

227
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,504
-Ross, turn the heat down, please?
-Sure.

228
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,840
There's a difference between obsessive-

229
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,174
Ross, the heat!

230
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:24,470
Okay. Heat, heat, heat.
And I'm the obsessive one?

231
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,431
Okay.

232
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,349
This way is on.

233
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,477
So this is...

234
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,106
...off.

235
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,359
Did you just break the radiator?

236
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,487
No, I was turning the knob and...

237
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,448
...here it is.

238
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,866
Well, put it back!

239
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,953
It, uh....

240
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,165
-It won't go back.
-Ugh. I'll call the super.

241
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,791
Here, let me try.

242
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,171
Oh, oh, that's right.
I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.

243
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,131
Hey, it's Funny's cousin...

244
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,424
...Not Funny!

245
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,259
Hi, Mr. Treeger?

246
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,386
It's Rachel Green from upstairs.

247
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,639
Yes, somebody, uh,
broke our knob on the radiator...

248
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,684
...and it's really hot in here.

249
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,854
Yes, it's hot enough to bake cookies.

250
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,984
Well, do you think
we could have a new one by 6?

251
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,987
What? No, no. Tuesday?
We can't wait until Tuesday.

252
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,947
We're having a party tonight.

253
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,449
Okay, tip the man.

254
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,534
If he doesn't like our cookies, too bad.

255
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,495
I won't be blackmailed.

256
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,955
Look, if it gets a little warm...

257
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,832
...it can be a theme party.

258
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,835
Here's a theme:
"Come on in, live like bacon!"

259
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,340
Ooh, this is it.

260
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,258
Seventy-four.

261
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,262
Oh, so that's what this is for!

262
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,555
Wow.

263
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,683
This is it. I'm gonna meet my dad.

264
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,019
This is, like, the biggest thing ever, huh?

265
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,271
-Yeah.
-Sure is.

266
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,148
Here I go. I'm going in.

267
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,400
All right!

268
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,859
Good luck, Pheebs.

269
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,611
Okay.

270
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,780
Here I go.

271
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,158
Here I go.

272
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,245
I'm going.

273
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,383
Hi.

274
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,969
Welcome to our tropical
Christmas party, heh.

275
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,722
Put your coats, sweaters,
pants and shirts in the bedroom.

276
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,602
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating...

277
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,856
...but I use exactly what the gel bottle says.

278
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,779
An amount about the size of a pea.
How can that be too much?

279
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,117
Ice?

280
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,912
Ice? Ice squares anyone?
Take a napkin.

281
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,164
All right.

282
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,249
Monica. Monica!

283
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,420
Monica, your guests are turning into jerky.

284
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,755
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.

285
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,009
Ha, ha. Hey! Get in line, buddy.
I was next.

286
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,973
Mr. Treeger.

287
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,558
You said there was a party.

288
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,059
Oh, yeah.

289
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,811
Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.

290
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,857
Uh, is it hot? My body always stays cool.

291
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,485
Probably because I have so much skin.

292
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,196
Hey, cheese!

293
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,617
Here's the chance.
Monica, give him cash.

294
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,953
Rachel, give him your earrings.
Something. Anything!

295
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,705
No, I will not cave.

296
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,956
I'm with Mon.

297
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,418
All right. You know how you say
I never seize the day?

298
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,005
Even though he's your super, I'm seizing.

299
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:48,925
Mr. Treeger?

300
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,970
Here is 50 bucks. Merry Christmas.

301
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,388
Oh, wow.

302
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,640
I didn't get you anything.

303
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,018
Here's five back.

304
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,563
No, that's your Christmas tip.

305
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,276
Oh, do you think there's a chance
you can fix that radiator now?

306
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,737
No can do. Like I told the girl...

307
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,739
...I can't get a knob until Tuesday.

308
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,158
-Ross?
-Yeah?

309
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,077
He's playing baseball.

310
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,079
You mean hardball?

311
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,500
Whatever.

312
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,335
What you gonna do?

313
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,671
Excuse me. I'm seizing.

314
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,881
Mr. Treeger?

315
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,217
Here's another 50.

316
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,052
Happy Hanukkah.

317
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,347
Will, uh, this help with the knob-getting?

318
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,765
No.

319
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,893
The place is not open till Tuesday.

320
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,436
Am I not saying it right?

321
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,108
So you really did like my cookies?

322
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:51,112
Oh, yeah, they were so personal.
It really showed you cared.

323
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,327
Nice seizing...

324
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,413
...gel boy.

325
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,625
So, uh....

326
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,752
Is this, uh, mistletoe?

327
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,423
No, uh, that....

328
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,883
That is basil.

329
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,053
-Oh.
-Yeah.

330
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,223
If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.

331
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,185
No, it's still basil.

332
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,075
Okay.

333
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,870
-How far did you get?
-Mailbox.

334
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,081
-All right, we're getting closer.
-Uh-huh.

335
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,667
What's going on?

336
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,296
It's just, like, a whole mess of stuff.

337
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:55,051
Like yesterday, my dad was
this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

338
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,721
And, you know, now he's, uh,
a pharmacist guy and-

339
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,059
Well, maybe he's this
really cool pharmacist guy.

340
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,647
Yeah, maybe. And I'll knock on the door...

341
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,067
...and he'll hug me, and I'll have a dad.

342
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,904
I'll go to his pharmacy
and everyone will be nice to me...

343
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,074
...because, you know,
I'm Frank's daughter.

344
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,617
So why not go knock?

345
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:28,501
Because, I mean,
what if he's not this great dad guy?

346
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:33,756
What if he's still the dirtbag
who ran out on my mom and us?

347
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,510
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

348
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,054
You know what?

349
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,683
I've already lost a fake dad this week.

350
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,770
I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.

351
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,567
Pheebs, that's okay.
You took a big step today.

352
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,320
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

353
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:00,032
Someday, when you're ready,
you'll make it past the hedges.

354
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,077
And when you do,
he'll be lucky to have you.

355
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,830
You guys.

356
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,335
Sorry about your shopping.

357
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,964
Oh, that's okay. We'll figure something out.

358
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,385
I know you're not going in there...

359
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,097
...but do you think it'd be all right
if I went in and used his bathroom?

360
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,517
That's fine, never mind.

361
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,228
Cool, snow!

362
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,939
Kind of like a blank canvas.

363
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,535
Ho-ho-ho-holy crap, is it hot in here!

364
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,039
You mind if I turn the heat down?

365
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,626
We could have used
that kind of thinking earlier!

366
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,670
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

367
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,922
Oh, ahem, I couldn't go in.

368
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,258
-Honey, I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

369
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,261
Yeah, it's okay,
because I know he's there.

370
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,346
So that's enough for now.

371
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,725
Hey, it's after midnight!
Merry Christmas, everyone!

372
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,562
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

373
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,315
The knob was broken...

374
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:18,152
...so I turned it off from underneath.
I hope that's all right.

375
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,500
Rach, these are for you.

376
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,544
Wiper blades.

377
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,505
I don't even have a car.

378
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,801
Ha, ha. No, but with this new-car smell,
you'll think you do.

379
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,306
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

380
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,520
Toilet-seat covers.

381
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,691
Is that what you were doing
while I was getting gas?

382
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,026
-Uh-huh.
-Mm-hm.

383
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,195
You guys!

384
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,613
And for Ross...

385
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,199
...Mr. Sweet Tooth.

386
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,246
You got me a cola drink?

387
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,207
And a lemon-lime!

388
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:20,130
Well, this is too much. I feel like
I should get you another sweater.

389
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,885
And last but not least....

390
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,598
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
