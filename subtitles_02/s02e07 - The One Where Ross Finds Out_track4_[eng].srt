1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:06,173
Okay. What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,676
Is there something
repellent about me?

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,595
How was the party?

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,182
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.

5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,310
So, what is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?

6
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,605
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.

7
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,607
I go through the exact same thing.

8
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,818
Every time I put on a little weight,
I question everything.

9
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,989
Whoa, whoa.

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,325
I've put on a little weight?

11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,994
-Did you want to...?
-Yeah, uh....

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,250
No, not weight. More like insulation.

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,712
Chandler, I'm unemployed,
in dire need of a project.

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,589
Wanna work out? I can remake you.

15
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:52,094
Uh, I would, but that might get
in the way of my lying-around time.

16
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,304
-Please?
-Come on, let her do it!

17
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,808
All right. But if we put on spandex...

18
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:01,019
...and my boobs are bigger than yours,
I'm going home.

19
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,398
Your boobs are fine.
Look, I never should have said anything.

20
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,650
Come here. Come here!

21
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,321
Ooh, can't make hands meet!

22
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,751
Okay! Let's do it.

23
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,673
What?

24
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,594
Nothing. Just never seen
you in little stretchy pants before.

25
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,306
And we're changing.

26
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,656
-Unh!
-Come on, give me five more!

27
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,825
-Ugh. Aah!
-Five more!

28
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,411
Five more and I'll flash you.

29
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,080
One...

30
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,791
...two...

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,710
...two and a half.

32
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,506
Just show me one of them.

33
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:01,681
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

34
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,146
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

35
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,692
She's insane! The woman is insane.

36
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,611
It's before work, after work,
and during work.

37
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,031
She's got me doing
butt-clenches at my desk.

38
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,242
And now they won't
bring me my mail anymore.

39
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,579
Hey, Pheebs. How'd it go with Scott?

40
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,083
Oh, um, it was nice.
Took him to a romantic restaurant...

41
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,168
...ordered champagne. Nice.

42
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,631
-The guy still won't put out?
-Nope. Zilch. Nothing. Uh-uh.

43
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,883
-Sorry, Pheebs.
-Sorry, Pheebs.

44
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,219
Well, look, I don't mind taking it slow.

45
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,679
I like him a lot.

46
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,974
He's really interesting,
and he's really sweet.

47
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,059
Why won't he give it up?

48
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,564
Maybe he, uh, drives his car
on the other side of the road.

49
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,524
If you know what I mean.

50
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,570
No. What do you mean?
He's not British.

51
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,742
-Maybe he's gay.
-Oh!

52
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,745
Um, no, I don't think that's the problem.

53
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,747
We went, urn,
dancing the other night...

54
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:12,335
...and just the way he held me so close
and the way he was looking into my eyes...

55
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,921
...I just definitely felt something.

56
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,549
Yeah, but how much can you
tell from a look?

57
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,676
No, I felt it on my hip. I could tell.

58
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,766
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.

59
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,686
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand
and smack her with it.

60
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,313
Heh.

61
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,232
Ooh. Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

62
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,026
What?

63
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,988
Come on, guys.
I don't care. I have a date tonight.

64
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,656
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You have a date?

65
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,742
Yeah. Monica's setting me up.

66
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,745
Heh, now, what about, uh, Ross and....

67
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,247
What? My whole
insane jealousy thing?

68
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, you know,
as much fun as that was...

69
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,419
...I've decided to opt for sanity.

70
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,713
So you're okay about all this?

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,132
Oh, yeah, come on! I'm moving on.

72
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,011
He can press her up against
that window as much as he wants.

73
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,973
For all I care, he can throw her
through the damn thing.

74
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,976
-Hi, guys.
-Hey.

75
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,314
Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow
and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?

76
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,233
Only if you say his full name.

77
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:22,113
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up
Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

78
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,742
-All right.
-You're getting a cat?

79
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,037
Actually, we're getting a cat. Heh.

80
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,830
-Together?
-Uh-huh.

81
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,124
-Both of you? Together?
-Yup.

82
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,961
It'll live with Ross half the time
and me half the time.

83
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,548
Oh, well, isn't that just lovely?

84
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,218
Ha, ha. That's something
the two of you will be able to enjoy...

85
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,012
...for a really, really, really long time.

86
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,764
-Hopefully.
-Oh, wow.

87
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,309
Whoa! Look at that.
I gotta go! I got a date!

88
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,979
With a man. Ahem, okay.

89
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,439
You guys have a really, uh, good night...

90
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,652
...and you two have a, uh,
really good cat. Heh.

91
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,409
We're not supposed to
take these when we leave.

92
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,042
I don't know if Monica told you...

93
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,546
...but this the first date I've gone on
since my divorce.

94
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,673
So if I seem a little nervous...

95
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,008
...I am.

96
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,385
How long do cats live?

97
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,432
-I'm sorry?
-Cats. How long do they live?

98
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,602
Figuring you don't throw them
under a bus or something?

99
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,897
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.

100
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,400
Well, that's just great.

101
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,320
-Um, cheers.
-Mm.

102
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,363
Right. Clink. Heh.

103
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,664
Monica told you I was cuter
than this, didn't she?

104
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,754
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry. It's just....

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,341
It's this thing.
It's probably not as bad as it sounds...

106
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,303
...but this friend of mine
is getting a cat with his girlfriend.

107
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,430
Oh, that does sound....

108
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:16,019
-Huh.
-He just started going out with her.

109
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,731
Ahem. Is this guy, uh, an old boyfriend?

110
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,735
Yeah, he wishes.

111
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,490
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me.

112
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,576
Okay, Michael, let's talk about you.

113
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,954
-All right.
-Okay. Okay?

114
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,831
So....

115
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,503
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?

116
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,091
-So I figured it out.
-What?

117
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,510
Why Scott doesn't want
to sleep with me.

118
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,095
I'm not sexy enough.

119
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,640
Heh, Phoebe, that's crazy.

120
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,351
When I first met you,
you know what I said to Chandler?

121
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,854
-Mm-mm.
-I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

122
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,651
Really? That's so sweet.

123
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,907
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.

124
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,829
Look, if you wanna know what the deal is,
you're gonna have to ask him.

125
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,707
You're right. You're right.

126
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,542
Ugh, you are so yum!

127
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,691
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.

128
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,571
Why can't they get one of those bugs?
One of those fruit flies.

129
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,906
Those things that live for a day.

130
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,117
What are they called?
What are they called?

131
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,370
-Fruit flies?
-Yes!

132
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,039
-Thank you.
-Would you like any dessert?

133
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,667
No! No dessert.

134
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,086
Just the check. Please.

135
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,923
Oh, no. You're not having fun, are you?

136
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,759
No, no, I am.

137
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,764
But only because I've been playing
the movie <i>Diner </i>in my head.

138
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,933
Oh, look at me.

139
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,602
Look at me.

140
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,355
Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy.

141
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,816
All I can think about is Ross...

142
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,902
...and his cat...

143
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,612
...and his Julie.

144
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,325
I just want to get over him.
God, why can't I do that?

145
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,951
Oy.

146
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,997
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.

147
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,958
You can't see it because
you haven't had closure-

148
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,168
Aah!

149
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,836
Closure!

150
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,422
That's what it is. That's what I need.

151
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,424
God, you're brilliant!

152
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,845
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?

153
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,643
Well, there's no one way
really, it's just....

154
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,979
Whatever it takes so that
you can finally say to him:

155
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,356
"I'm over you."

156
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,360
Over you. That's what it is.

157
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,905
Closure.

158
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,574
Hello? Excuse me?

159
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,744
Excuse me. Hel- Whoo!

160
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,246
-Hang on.
-Hello? Excuse me?

161
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,164
-What?
-Hi. I'm sorry.

162
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,751
I need to borrow your phone
for just one minute.

163
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,087
-I'm talking.
-I see that.

164
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:33,967
It's one phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.

165
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,846
Okay, you're being a little weird
about your phone.

166
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,351
All right. Fine.

167
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,645
I'll call you back.

168
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,107
Thank you.

169
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,777
Okay.

170
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,616
Machine.

171
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,911
-Just waiting for the beep.
-Good.

172
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,624
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

173
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,377
I'm just calling to say that, um...

174
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,879
...everything's fine.

175
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,298
And I'm really happy for you...

176
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,675
...and your cat.

177
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,263
Who, by the way,
I think you should name Michael.

178
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,476
And you see there,
I'm thinking of names...

179
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,022
...so obviously I am over you.

180
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,400
I am over you.

181
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,822
And that, my friend,
is what they call "closure."

182
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,752
No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

183
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,423
Monica, it's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.

184
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,259
-Why not?
-Because it's Sunday!

185
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,179
It's God's day.

186
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,099
Ha, hey. If you say stop, then we stop.

187
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,476
Ha, ha, okay.

188
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,854
-Stop.
-No, come on! We can't stop!

189
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,981
We got three more pounds to go!

190
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,984
I am the energy train
and you are on board!

191
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,829
Whoo.

192
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,461
-Hey, Rach.
-Mm.

193
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,381
-Oh. And how was the date?
-Ugh.

194
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,759
Um, I think there was a restaurant.

195
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,928
I know there was wine.

196
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,555
Wow. Well, uh....

197
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,225
Uh, actually, Julie's getting a cab.

198
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,603
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say...?

199
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,439
What? Why are you
looking at me like that? Heh.

200
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,025
Ahem, I'm sorry. I don't know, I....

201
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,903
I feel like I had a dream
about you last night...

202
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,446
...but I don't remember.

203
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,491
Okay.

204
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,159
Heh. Oh, oh, oh.

205
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,287
-There they are.
-Ahem.

206
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,331
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?

207
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,917
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

208
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,587
-Huh.
-Oh, I haven't even been home yet.

209
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,589
Do you mind if I check my messages?

210
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,425
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

211
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,389
Rach, I got a message from you!

212
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,938
-Who's Michael?
-Oh, my God.

213
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,482
God, Ross, no! Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!

214
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,360
Give me the phone! Give me the phone!
Give me the phone!

215
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,237
Give me the-

216
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,745
You're over me?

217
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,705
Oh, God.

218
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,082
-Wha~? You're, uh-
-Oh, God.

219
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,252
-You're over me?
-Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

220
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,505
Oh, my God. Oh....

221
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,217
When-? When were you...

222
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,053
...under me?

223
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,475
Rach.

224
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,310
Rachel, do you...?

225
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,896
I mean, were you, uh-?

226
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,565
-Ugh. Okay. Okay, okay.
-What?

227
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,568
Well, basically...

228
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,404
...ahem, lately, I've, uh....

229
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,992
Ahem, I've sort of had feelings for you.

230
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,791
You've had feelings for me?

231
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,126
Yeah, so? You had feelings for me first.

232
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,295
Whoa, huh.

233
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,508
You know about my--?
You know I had-?

234
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,510
You know?

235
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,888
-Chandler told me.
-When did he-?

236
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,932
When did he-? When did he?

237
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,520
-When you were in China.
-China.

238
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,647
-Meeting Julie.
-Julie.

239
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,608
Julie. That's-- Oh, God.

240
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,069
Julie? Julie, right.

241
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,571
Okay, I need to lie down.

242
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,075
-No, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand...
-Okay.

243
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,078
...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.

244
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,746
Okay, so you, uh...?

245
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,374
And now, what? Now-? Now.

246
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,209
Now you're over me?

247
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,421
Are you over me?

248
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:36,185
That's- That's Julie. That's Julie. Julie.

249
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,938
-Hi, Julie.
-<i>Honey, I've got a cab waiting.</i>

250
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,982
I'll be right down!

251
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,571
Wait, so you're going?

252
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:50,491
Well, okay, I, uh- I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.

253
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,910
I mean, I've, uh- Heh.
You know, I've got a cab.

254
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,372
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.

255
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,333
Okay. Okay.

256
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,669
Cat!

257
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,730
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

258
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,610
How come you're watching
a rabbi play electric guitar?

259
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,155
I can't find the remote.

260
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,368
Ugh, thank you. Heh.

261
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,997
So, Scott asked me to come over
for lunch and I did.

262
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,000
-And?
-And we did.

263
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,504
-All right, Pheebs! Way to go!
-Yay, me. Ha, ha.

264
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,173
So how did it happen?

265
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,176
I took your advice and
asked him what was going on.

266
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,677
What did he say?

267
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:56,224
He said he understands how sex can be
a very emotional thing for a woman.

268
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,310
And he was just afraid
that I was going to get all, you know:

269
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,563
"Is he gonna call me the next day?"
and "Where is this going?" and:

270
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:09,153
So he said he wanted to hold off
until he was prepared to be serious.

271
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,155
-Wow.
-Yeah.

272
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:15,660
So I said, "Okay. Relax, please."
You know?

273
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:20,665
I mean, sex can be just about two people
right there in the moment.

274
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,835
If he wants to see me again,
he can call. If not, that's fine too.

275
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,923
So after a lot of talking, heh...

276
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,551
...I convinced him. Heh!

277
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,015
Let me get this straight.

278
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,269
He got you to beg to sleep with him.

279
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,063
He got you to say
he never has to call you again.

280
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,943
And he got you thinking
this is a great idea?

281
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,737
Uh-huh.

282
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,283
This man is my god.

283
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,468
-Hi.
-I didn't get a cat.

284
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,599
Oh, that's, um, interesting.

285
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,644
No. No, it's not interesting.
Okay? It's very, very not interesting.

286
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,897
It's actually a hundred percent
the opposite of interesting.

287
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,399
I got it, Ross.

288
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,235
You had no right to tell me
you had feelings for me.

289
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,529
-What?
-I was doing great with Julie...

290
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,197
...before I found out about you.

291
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,533
I was doing great before
I found out about you!

292
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,952
You think it's easy for me
to see you with Julie?

293
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,204
You should've said something
before I met her.

294
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,708
I didn't know then. And how come
you never said anything to me?

295
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,460
There was never a good time.

296
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,047
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!

297
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,174
Not- Not- Not...

298
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,759
...every night.

299
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,138
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.

300
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,057
You know, like Italian guys...

301
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,727
...or ex-fiances, or- Or- Or-

302
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,229
Italian guys.

303
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,568
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?

304
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,655
The point is, I don't need this right now!

305
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,615
Okay? It's too late.

306
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,743
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy. This ship has sailed!

307
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,163
You're just gonna put away feelings
or whatever it was you felt for me?

308
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,999
I've done it since ninth grade.
I've gotten good at it.

309
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,668
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that, Ross.

310
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,212
I don't need your stupid ship!

311
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,214
-Good.
-Good!

312
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,258
And you know what? Now I got closure!

313
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,105
Try the bottom one.

314
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,512
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

315
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,432
We're not working out. It's over.

316
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,351
No way! With one pound to go?
Come on!

317
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,314
<i>We're workin', we're movin'
We're in the zone, we're groovin'</i>

318
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,233
Okay, I don't mind the last pound.

319
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,320
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

320
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,324
So don't make me do anything
that I'll regret.

321
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:27,411
Ha, oh, what you gonna do, fat boy, huh?
Ha, ha.

322
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,121
What? Heh.

323
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:35,169
Nothing. Except tell you, uh, it's
wonderful how much energy you have.

324
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,296
Well, thanks.

325
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,966
Especially considering how tough
it's been for you to find work.

326
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,552
Well, you know. Heh.

327
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,845
You know, I mean...

328
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:50,100
...you can't tell your parents you were fired,
because they'd be disappointed.

329
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,603
Uh-huh.

330
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,440
It's not as if you have
a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

331
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,444
-Well, no. But I-
-I mean...

332
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,948
...if it were me, I'd have difficulty
getting out of bed at all.

333
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,748
You know, I try to stay positive.

334
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,667
So you...?

335
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,753
You feel like going for a run?

336
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,132
All right.

337
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:27,429
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.

338
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,641
Okay.

339
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,270
-Just for a little while.
-Okay.
