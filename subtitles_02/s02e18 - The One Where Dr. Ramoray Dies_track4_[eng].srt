1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:05,172
<i>-Oh, Drake.
-I'm sorry, Amber.</i>

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,925
<i>It's just like Brad to have
to have the last word.</i>

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,054
-I'm sorry I'm late. What happened?
-We wanna see the end.

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>-I want you, Drake.
-I know you do.</i>

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,351
<i>But you and I can never
be together that way.</i>

6
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,146
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-There's something I never told you.</i>

7
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:24,233
<i>I'm actually your half-brother.</i>

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,193
-What?
-Huh?

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,198
So, what happens next?

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,868
Well, I get the medical award
for separating the Siamese twins.

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:39,331
Then Amber and I go to Venezuela
to meet our other half-brother, Ramon...

12
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,336
...and that's where I find the world's
biggest emerald. It's really big.

13
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,796
But it's cursed.

14
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,008
-So cool!
-God, that is good TV.

15
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,019
-Pheebs, play with me!
-No!

16
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,562
This game is grotesque.

17
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,691
Twenty armless guys joined
at the waist by a steel bar...

18
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,278
...forced to play soccer forever? Ugh!

19
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,655
Hello? Human rights violation.

20
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,700
Don't feel so bad.
After they're done playing...

21
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:01,038
...I break out the plastic women
and everybody has a pretty good time.

22
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,249
Why don't you play with your roommate?

23
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,043
Eh, he's, uh....

24
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,170
He's not a big fan of foosball.

25
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:11,131
Uh-oh. Ooh. Are we not getting along
with the new boy?

26
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:15,260
No, he's all right. He just, uh,
spends most of his time in his room.

27
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,055
Maybe because you haven't
taken time to get to know him.

28
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,806
Let's remedy that, shall we?

29
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,060
-We don't need to remedy that.
-Oh, yeah, it'll be fun!

30
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,564
-What was that?
-Hi!

31
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,484
Um, I thought it'd be fun
if the three of us had beers...

32
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,194
...and got to know each other.

33
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,489
-All right. That sounds all right.
-Oh, good! Okay.

34
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:40,202
Oh, no, I have to go,
because I'm late for my, urn...

35
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,454
<i>...Green Eggs and Ham
</i>discussion group.

36
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,542
Um, tonight, it's "Why he would not
eat them on a train."

37
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,212
-Have fun! Bye!
-That was so lame.

38
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,339
I know. Yeah, heh.

39
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,800
-Okay, talk to him.
-Ahem.

40
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:02,974
So you, uh, think that <i>Speed Racer </i>guy
gets a lot of tickets or...?

41
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,771
Ha-ha-ha. That's good.
So who broke up with who?

42
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,690
You kidding? I broke up with her.

43
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,527
She actually thought Sean Penn
was the capital of Cambodia.

44
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,156
When everybody knows that
the, uh, capital of Cambodia is....

45
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,117
Is, uh....

46
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,536
It's not Sean Penn.

47
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,996
All right, I got a funny one. All right?

48
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,958
My last girlfriend, Tilly.
We're eating breakfast, right?

49
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,502
I made these pancakes.
Like, 50 pancakes.

50
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,839
All of a sudden,
she turns to me and says, "Eddie...

51
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,049
...I don't wanna see you anymore."
Ha, ha.

52
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,094
It was literally like she had
reached into my chest...

53
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,681
...ripped out my heart
and smeared it all over my life!

54
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,768
There was this incredible abyss
and I'm falling.

55
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,729
I keep falling and
I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!

56
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,028
That wasn't such a funny story, was it?

57
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,287
<i>And a crusty old man
Said I'll do what I can</i>

58
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,747
<i>And the rest of the rats
Played maracas</i>

59
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,627
That's it! Thanks! Good night.

60
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,465
-Phoebe's got another job, right?
-Heh.

61
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,676
-Great set tonight, Pheebs.
-Yes.

62
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:20,969
I know.

63
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,889
-We should get going.
-Mm.

64
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,850
We should too.
I've got patients at 8 in the morning.

65
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,311
You know how we always stay
at your apartment?

66
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,772
I thought tonight
we'd stay at my place.

67
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,524
I don't know.
I don't have my jammies.

68
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,859
Heh.

69
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,360
You don't need them.

70
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,447
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.

71
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,283
Shut up. I'm happy.

72
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,246
Oh, this is so nice!
I have to make a speech.

73
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,790
Ahem. I just want to say...

74
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,543
...of all the guys that Monica
has been with, and that is a lot...

75
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,590
-...I like you the best.
-Aw.

76
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,426
Thank you, Pheebs.
That's very sweet.

77
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,094
You hear that?

78
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,848
She likes me best. And apparently,
there have been a lot.

79
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,768
Not a lot.

80
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,479
Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.

81
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,024
Phoebe's dead.

82
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,031
-Hi.
-Hi.

83
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,741
I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.

84
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,619
Oh, uh, he's not here right now.
I'm Chandler.

85
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,705
Can I take a message or....
Or a fish tank?

86
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,082
Thanks.

87
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,959
Come on in.

88
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,377
I'm Tilly.

89
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,550
Oh.

90
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,511
I gather by that "Oh,"
he told you about me.

91
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,556
Yeah, your, uh, name came up...

92
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,268
...in a conversation that
terrified me to my very soul.

93
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,062
He's kind of intense, huh?

94
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,065
Yes! Hey, can I ask you,
is Eddie a little...

95
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,943
-A little what?
-...bit country?

96
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,406
Come on in, you roomie!

97
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,908
Hello, Tilly.

98
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,578
Eddie, I just came by
to drop off your tank.

99
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,955
That was very thoughtful of you.

100
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,707
It's very thoughtful.

101
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,588
Well, okay then.

102
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,257
I'm gonna go. Bye.

103
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,134
-Bye.
-Bye.

104
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,887
So we getting a fish?

105
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,599
You had sex with her, didn't you?

106
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,729
Pheebs! Check it out, check it out!

107
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:40,066
Oh, ooh, <i>Soap Opera Digest!
</i>That's one of my favorite digests!

108
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,862
-Page 42! Page 42!
-Okay, okay.

109
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,905
Okay. Ooh. Hey!

110
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,950
"New Doc on the Block,
<i>Days of our Lives </i>Joey Tribbiani."

111
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,620
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh, cool picture!

112
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,039
-Ah.
-Oh, I look good.

113
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:59,002
Is this true? That you write
a lot of your own lines?

114
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,171
Well, kind of, yeah.

115
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,342
Remember last week
when Alex was in the accident?

116
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,385
The line in the script was:

117
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,056
"If we don't get this woman
to a hospital, she's going to die."

118
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,309
But I made it, "If this woman
doesn't get to a hospital...

119
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,436
...she's not gonna live."

120
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,524
Oh, okay.
I see what you did there.

121
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:28,031
Aren't you afraid the writers will be
kind of mad when they read this?

122
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,532
Huh.

123
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,079
I never thought about the writers.
The scripts just come to my house.

124
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,416
But you know what?

125
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,045
This makes me look good,
which makes the show look good...

126
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,966
...which makes the writers look good.
So how could they be mad?

127
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,511
<i>Makes up most of his lines.</i>

128
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,970
<i>Son of a....</i>

129
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,725
<i>Yeah. Write this, jerk-weed.</i>

130
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,686
I fall down an elevator shaft?

131
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,855
What does this mean?
I fall down an elevator shaft?

132
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,526
Uh, I don't know.
I just bring the scripts.

133
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,489
They can't kill me!
I'm Francesca's long-lost son!

134
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,741
Right.

135
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,702
Uh, could you sign?

136
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,871
No! No way! I'm not signing that!

137
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,375
I don't think that's gonna affect
the plot of the show.

138
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,795
How can they do this to me?

139
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,134
All right, uh, I'm just gonna go.

140
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,885
Sorry.

141
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,227
Well, it wasn't that many guys.

142
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,397
If you consider how many guys
there actually are...

143
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,150
-...it's a very small percentage.
-Hey.

144
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,111
It's not that big a deal.
I was just curious.

145
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,029
-Good night.
-Good night, Richard.

146
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,115
Good luck, Mon.

147
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:56,578
All right, before I tell you, uh, you tell me
how many women you've been with.

148
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:03,043
-Two.
-Two? Two? Heh.

149
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,462
How is that possible? I mean...

150
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,756
...have you seen you?

151
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,259
Well, I mean, what can I say?

152
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,638
I was married to Barbara for 30 years,
my high-school sweetheart.

153
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,807
Now you. That's two.

154
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,810
-Two it is. Heh.
-Mm-hm.

155
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,313
Okay, time for bed.
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

156
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,024
Whoa, no, wait a minute now!

157
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,984
Come on, it's your turn.

158
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,028
Oh, come on!

159
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,991
You know, I don't need the
actual number. Just a ballpark.

160
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,496
Okay, it is definitely
less than a ballpark.

161
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,711
Wow, I am so glad
I'm not Monica right now.

162
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,671
Tell me about it.

163
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,508
So, what's your magic number?

164
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,052
Ann....

165
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:58,598
Come on, you know everyone
I've been with. All both of them.

166
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,518
Well, ahem, there's you.

167
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,770
Better not be doing these in order.

168
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,025
Okay, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.

169
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,860
-Ah.
-Barry.

170
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,154
And, uh, oh, Paolo.

171
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,533
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.

172
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,955
Oh, honey, are you jealous of Paolo?

173
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,792
I'm so much happier with you
than I ever was with him.

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,044
-Really?
-Oh, please.

175
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,297
That Paolo thing was
barely a relationship.

176
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,218
All it really was
was just meaningless, animal sex.

177
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:44,060
Okay, you know, that sounded
so much better in my head.

178
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,438
Eddie! I didn't sleep with
your ex-girlfriend.

179
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,900
That's exactly what someone
who slept with her would say.

180
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,195
This is nuts! Crazy!
She came over for two minutes...

181
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,739
...dropped off a fish tank and left!
End of story.

182
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,367
-Where's Buddy?
-Buddy?

183
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,161
My fish, Buddy.

184
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,497
There was no fish
when she dropped it off.

185
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,416
Oh, this is unbelievable!

186
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:11,171
You sleep with my ex-girlfriend,
insult my intelligence by lying...

187
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,339
...then you kill my fish?
My Buddy?

188
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,383
I didn't kill your fish!

189
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,427
Look, Eddie-

190
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,057
Would you look at what I'm doing?

191
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,059
Now that can't be smart.

192
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,649
So we're just gonna
take this guy right off you...

193
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,319
...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

194
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,739
Tangelo?

195
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,710
That's it? That's the giant number
you were afraid to tell me?

196
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,963
-Well, yeah.
-Well, that's not bad at all.

197
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,883
You had me thinking it was,
like, a fleet.

198
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,427
You're okay with it?

199
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,346
Oh, honey, I'm fine.

200
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,680
Oh, yay!

201
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,894
Okay, about that two.

202
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,395
What?

203
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,605
All right.

204
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,649
What about my two?

205
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,485
It just seems like
a really small number.

206
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,736
Right.

207
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,364
-And?
-And, well....

208
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,492
Don't you have a lot
of wild oats to sow?

209
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:27,497
Or is that what you're doing with me?
Oh, my God! Am I an oat?

210
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,124
Honey, you are not an oat.

211
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,170
I don't know, I guess
I'm just not an oat guy.

212
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,339
I've only slept with women I love.

213
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,758
You've only slept with two people.

214
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,431
Right.

215
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,185
Wow.

216
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,854
Oh, wow.

217
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,857
You know I love you too, right?

218
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,360
Now I do.

219
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,991
Ugh, Ross!

220
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,701
Ross, please listen to me.

221
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:09,080
Ross, you are so much better for me
than Paolo ever was.

222
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,375
You care about me, you're loving,
you make me laugh.

223
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,919
If I make you laugh, here's an idea.

224
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,589
Invite Paolo to have a romp in the sack,
and I'll stand in the corner...

225
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,426
-...and tell knock-knock jokes.
-Ross! Agh!

226
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,012
God, Ross!

227
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,265
What you and I have is special!
All Paolo and I ever had was-

228
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,683
Animal sex, animal sex?

229
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,688
So, what are you saying?

230
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,816
There's nothing between us
"animal" at all?

231
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,987
There's not even,
like, um, a little animal?

232
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,822
Not even, like...

233
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,449
...chipmunk sex?

234
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,952
Okay, Ross....

235
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,955
Try to hear me, okay?

236
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,291
I— Hey. I'm not gonna lie to you.

237
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,211
-It was good with Paolo.
-Knock-knock.

238
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,425
But what you and I have
is so much better.

239
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,013
We have tenderness,
we have intimacy, we connect.

240
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,681
You know? I swear.

241
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,017
This is the best...

242
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,936
...I have ever had.

243
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,523
-Until now.
-Aah!

244
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,906
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

245
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,657
Richard told me he loved me.

246
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:27,992
-Oh, my God!
-I know!

247
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,577
Honey, that's great!

248
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,995
-I know!
-Ha, ha.

249
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,914
-I just can't find—
-Top drawer.

250
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,208
-Hurry.
-Why? You need one too?

251
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,794
Oh, yeah.

252
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,338
-Found them!
-Whoo.

253
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,259
There's only one.

254
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,221
-Monica!
-Hi.

255
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:52,475
Uh, we'll be right there.
We're just trying to decide something.

256
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,396
Rachel?

257
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,909
-Hey.
-Hey.

258
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,955
-They're trying to decide something.
-Good. Good, good.

259
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:24,465
So is, urn- So was your mustache-
Did it used to be different?

260
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,719
-No.
-Oh.

261
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,600
How do you, uh, you know,
keep it so neat?

262
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,688
-I have a little comb.
-Oh.

263
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,068
-What do you call that?
-A mustache comb.

264
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,653
Thank you.

265
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,867
Okay, I will do your laundry
for one month.

266
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,244
-No!
-Okay, okay!

267
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,079
I will, I will, I will....

268
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,957
I will clean the apartment
for two months.

269
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:02,461
I'll give this to you now, if you
tell me where we keep the dustpan.

270
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,848
So were you in Nam?

271
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,688
-Rock, paper, scissors?
-Gotcha.

272
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,024
One, two, three.

273
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,859
-Yes!
-Agh!

274
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,321
-Ah!
-Fine. Go have sex.

275
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,159
No! You have got it completely wrong!

276
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,204
John Savage was <i>Deer Hunter,
</i>no legs.

277
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,332
Jon Voight was <i>Coming Home,
</i>couldn't feel his legs.

278
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,711
No, you've got it totally the other way
around, my friend. Jon Voight-

279
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,713
-Honey? Ahem.
-What? Oh.

280
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,807
-Shall we?
-It's not gonna happen.

281
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,311
They're doing it tonight.
We can do it tomorrow.

282
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:06,567
Uh, in the future, if I could see
the schedule beforehand....

283
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,156
So when I woke up this morning...

284
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,534
...he'd stolen all the insoles
out of my shoes!

285
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,827
Why?

286
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,873
He thinks I slept with his
ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.

287
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,917
Why would you kill his fish?

288
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,006
Because sometimes
after you sleep with someone...

289
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,592
...you have to kill a fish.

290
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,137
Chandler, honey...

291
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,514
...I'm sorry.

292
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,058
Can we watch Joey's show now, please?

293
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,102
-Yeah!
-Wait. He's not here yet.

294
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,604
He's on the show,
he knows what happens.

295
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,233
I'm fine about my problem now,
by the way.

296
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,696
<i>Amber...</i>

297
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,740
<i>...I want you to know
I'll always be there for you...</i>

298
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,993
<i>...as a friend and as your brother.</i>

299
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,245
<i>Oh, Drake.</i>

300
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,247
<i>Hard day, huh?</i>

301
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,166
-First the medical award, now this?
-Yeah.

302
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,670
-Some guys are just lucky, I guess. Ha, ha.
-Ha-ha-ha.

303
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,505
<i>Dr. Ramoray...</i>

304
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,383
<i>-...report to first floor Emergency stat.
</i>-Hmm.

305
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,885
Well, then...

306
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,388
...I, uh, guess that's me.

307
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,227
Anyone else need to go on the elevator?
Dr. Horton? Dr. Wong?

308
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:26,480
No, no. They only said you.

309
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,235
Oh, okay. All right.

310
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,071
-I love you, Drake.
-Yeah, whatever.

311
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,075
-Oh, no!
-Drake, look out!

312
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,041
-Did they just kill off Joey?
-No!

313
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,170
Now maybe.

314
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,758
Come on! Open up!
We want to talk to you!

315
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,426
I don't feel like talking!

316
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,428
Come on! We care about you.

317
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,891
-We're worried about you.
-And some of us have to pee!

318
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,563
I'm sorry, Joey.

319
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,152
Listen, sorry about your death.
That really sucks.

320
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,156
-We came over as soon as we saw.
-How could you not tell us?

321
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:21,118
I don't know. I was kind of hoping
no one would ever find out.

322
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,331
Well, maybe they could find
a way to bring you back.

323
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:31,003
No, they said that when they found
my body, my brain was so smashed in...

324
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,840
...that the only doctor
who could've saved me was me.

325
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,886
It's supposed to be
some kind of irony.

326
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,556
But Joey, you're gonna be fine.

327
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,185
You don't need that show.
It was just a dumb soap opera.

328
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,563
This was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

329
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,400
Yes! I was going to incorporate that.

330
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,987
Oh, good, here's Monica.
She'll have something nice to say.

331
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:02,076
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain
so you won't get mildew.

332
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,121
What? To me, that's nice.

333
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,499
It's gonna be okay. You know that.

334
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,751
No, I don't.

335
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,339
It's like you work
your whole life for something...

336
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,716
...and you think
that when you get it...

337
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,302
...it'll never be
as good as you thought.

338
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,263
But this so was.

339
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,223
It changed everything.

340
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,643
Like, the other day,
I got this credit card application...

341
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,187
...and I was pre-approved!

342
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:36,110
Huh? I've never been pre-approved
for anything in my life!

343
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,862
I'm sorry, man.

344
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,365
I don't know if this'll mean
anything to you...

345
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,201
...but you'll always be
pre-approved with us.

346
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,163
No, that means nothing to me.

347
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,002
Ann!

348
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,255
Pecan sandy? Just made them.

349
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,300
Yeah, all right.

350
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,595
Are these raisins?

351
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,221
Uh, sure, why not?

352
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,814
Listen, Eddie. Um, ahem.

353
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,860
I've been thinking about
our living situation and, uh....

354
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,195
Why are you smiling?

355
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,781
I got a little surprise.
Look. There's a new fishy.

356
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,867
I named him, uh...

357
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,620
...Chandler, you know, after you.

358
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,548
Well, that's not even a real fish.

359
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,302
No, that's a Goldfish cracker.

360
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,847
So, what's your point, man?

361
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,895
Okay, good night.

362
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,232
You big freak of nature.

363
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,208
-Aah.
-Hey.

364
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,672
Hey.

365
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,715
-Hey.
-Hey.

366
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,219
-Whoo. Brisk tonight.
-Oh, man.

367
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,764
-Let's never speak of this.
-You got it.
