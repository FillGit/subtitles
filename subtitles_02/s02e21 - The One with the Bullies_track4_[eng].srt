1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,463
<i>Stocks and bonds are moving higher....</i>

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,132
Why are we watching
the Business Channel?

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,261
Because the other day I saw there was
a stock with my initials, MEG, on it.

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,431
Sometimes it takes two or three hours
before it comes up again.

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,351
But when it does, it's exciting.

6
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,063
Hmm, okay, honey,
you really need a job.

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,359
Dad says he knows someone
you can call for an interview.

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,238
Right there! That's the third
sign today. Right there.

9
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,700
On behalf of everyone,
I'd just like to say, "Huh?"

10
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,663
No, you just said "dad."
And everywhere I go today...

11
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,457
...I keep getting signs
telling me to go see my father.

12
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,877
Like when I was walking over here
and I passed a buffet.

13
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,339
Which is my father's last name.

14
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,258
Ah.

15
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,218
And they were serving franks...

16
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,929
...which is his first name,
minus the "s" at the end.

17
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,681
-Yes.
-All right.

18
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:59,685
And there was a rotisserie
with a spinning chicken.

19
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,479
His Indian name?

20
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:07,150
No. Because I chickened out
the last time...

21
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,363
...when I tried to meet him.
So coincidences? I don't think so.

22
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,865
-Very freaky.
-Eerie.

23
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,784
Who wants the last hamburger?

24
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,120
That's it.
Now I have to go see him, ha, ha.

25
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,413
Why?

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,833
Hamburger? McDonald's?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,919
Old McDonald had a farm.
My dad is a pharmacist.

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,838
Ah.

29
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,428
Man, I am so beat.

30
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,180
Oh, yeah.

31
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,640
You wanna forget racquetball
and hang out?

32
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,392
Yeah, all right.

33
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,815
-Hey, you're in our seats.
-Oh, sorry, we didn't know.

34
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,651
Hey, we were sitting there.

35
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,987
Okay. There is one more way to say it.

36
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,864
-Who knows it? Ha, ha.
-Ha, ha.

37
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:42,079
-Is that supposed to be funny?
-Actually, I was going for colorful.

38
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,997
-What's with this guy?
-What's with you?

39
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,750
Uh, nothing. Nothing's with him.

40
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,377
Enjoy your coffee.

41
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,010
What just happened?

42
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,848
I just took your hat.
See, I can be funny too.

43
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,102
My joke is that I took your hat.

44
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,646
That is funny.

45
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,648
Can I have it back?

46
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,982
No.

47
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,152
-No?
-No.

48
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,780
Okay. Okay.

49
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,867
You know what?
I think you're very funny.

50
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,954
Kudos on that hat joke. Ha, ha.

51
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,000
But come on, guys,
just give him back the hat.

52
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,461
Why should we?

53
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,880
Because it's a special hat.

54
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,592
He bought it because
he was feeling down one day.

55
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,136
So he got the hat...

56
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,471
...to cheer himself up, you know?

57
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,559
-Now, Chandler-
-Stop talking. Stop talking now.

58
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,646
Let me get this straight.
You're stealing my hat?

59
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:50,897
You got a problem?

60
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,775
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

61
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,488
How'd the interview go?

62
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,990
It bit.

63
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,326
It was a '50s theme restaurant.

64
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:07,080
I'd have to cook in a costume
and dance on the counter.

65
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,583
I was a sous-chef
at Cafe des Artistes.

66
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:14,296
How can I take a job where I have
to make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?

67
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,798
-Don't do it.
-How can I not do it?

68
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,800
I have $127 in the bank.

69
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,012
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

70
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,513
I don't want a beer.

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,140
Who said it was for you?

72
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,773
Hi.

73
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,150
What's the matter?

74
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,528
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse
took my hat.

75
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,447
-No.
-You're kidding.

76
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,074
It was ridiculous.
These guys were bullies.

77
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,202
Actual bullies.

78
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,205
We're grownups. This kind of stuff
isn't supposed to happen anymore.

79
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,624
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

80
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,250
Oh....

81
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,045
Oh, no, wait a minute. I have no one.

82
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,468
Let's go down there
and get your hat back.

83
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,847
Forget it. It's probably stripped
and sold for parts by now.

84
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,893
-Hey. I went up!
-What?

85
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,438
My stock, MEG, it went up two points.

86
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,859
Do you realize that if I'd invested
my $127 in myself yesterday...

87
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,738
...that I'd, like, have
a lot more than that today.

88
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,824
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

89
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,036
-Do what?
-Put all my money in me.

90
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,081
You don't know a thing
about the stock market.

91
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,209
What's to know?
Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.

92
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,253
Yes, Manhattan.

93
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,713
Telephone number to the stock...

94
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,132
...selling store.

95
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,437
See? Didn't I tell you these pillows
would be a good idea?

96
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,898
Oh, God.

97
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,900
Here we go.

98
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,988
For the first time in my life,
I'm gonna say, "Hi, birth father!"

99
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,824
-We love you. We're here for you.
-Good luck.

100
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,075
Thanks.

101
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,622
Hey, Rach, you, uh,
want some sandwich?

102
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,125
Oh, what is in that?

103
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,502
Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

104
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,589
No, because mayo,
that would make it gross.

105
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,509
Hey, hey- No, oh, oh, oh.

106
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,304
-Run, Phoebe, run.
-No, no, doggy, please!

107
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,099
I do so want to love all animals.
Please, no. Back off!

108
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,435
-You got a bone?
-Are you kidding?

109
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,729
Look, kibbles! Bits, oh!

110
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,941
Get the hell off my leg,
you yippity piece of crap!

111
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,739
Ooh.

112
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,451
Okay. All right. We have a problem.

113
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,495
Why don't you take his trampoline?

114
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,831
Okay, here, I know what we can do.

115
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,375
Hey. Hey. Hey, no!

116
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,962
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich! Aah!

117
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,633
Go get the sandwich!
Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

118
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,928
The dog will lick himself
but he will not touch your sandwich.

119
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,597
What does that tell you?

120
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,142
-If he's not gonna eat it, I will.
-Are you crazy?

121
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,104
Pheebs, he's just a little dog. Aah!

122
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,904
-Hey.
-What?

123
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,531
Do you have to be
a Century 21 real-estate agent...

124
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,743
...to get to wear those cool jackets?

125
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,581
Do you say this stuff to girls?

126
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,337
Hey, isn't that the guy
who used to wear your hat?

127
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,339
And look where they're sitting.

128
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,721
You're joking, right?
You guys just walked through the door.

129
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,182
-Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
-Yeah.

130
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,060
This couch belongs to us.

131
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,772
I'll tell you what, you call the couch...

132
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,274
...and then we'll call the couch...

133
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,528
...and we'll see who it comes to.

134
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,866
You know what I keep wondering?
Why you two are still sitting here.

135
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,827
All right, that's it.

136
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,037
I have had enough of this, all right?

137
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,622
Gunther.

138
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,001
These guys are trying
to take our seat.

139
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,171
Fellas, these guys were here first.

140
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,215
-Oh, sorry, didn't realize.
-Ahem.

141
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,717
There you go.

142
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,177
Thank you, Gunther.

143
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,807
We didn't want to have
to go and do that.

144
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,519
He told on us?

145
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,937
You told on us?

146
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,399
Well, pal, you didn't
give me much of a choice.

147
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,403
-Don't play with his thing.
-I know.

148
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,157
All right.

149
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,868
Let's take this outside.

150
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,748
"Let's take this outside"?

151
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,502
Who talks like that?

152
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:09,132
The guy who's about to kick your ass
talks like that.

153
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,676
-You had to ask.
-Yeah.

154
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,057
Okay, okay, look. See...

155
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,352
...the thing is,
we're not gonna fight you guys.

156
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,688
Here's the deal.

157
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:28,860
You won't have to, so long as you
never ever show your faces here again.

158
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,160
I think you played
the Gunther card too soon.

159
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,585
Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.

160
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,545
Yeah, I don't know.

161
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,632
What's the matter?

162
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,301
I just think that this was
a really bad sign.

163
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,971
Like the beast at the threshold.

164
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:03,353
It's just I have no family left,
except for my grandmother.

165
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,481
But let's face it, she's not
gonna be around forever.

166
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,108
Despite what she says.

167
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:15,865
And I have a sister who I've barely
spoken to since we shared a womb.

168
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,201
I don't know. This is my real father...

169
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,204
...and I want things to be,
like, just right.

170
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,248
I completely understand.

171
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,999
Yeah, whatever you need.

172
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,294
Hey, you want to go home?

173
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,797
Okay, thanks. Sorry again.

174
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,068
What was that?

175
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:59,242
Uh, I'm guessing
the threshold's clear now.

176
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,498
I want to buy five shares of SGJ. Now.

177
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,209
Come on, time is money, my friend!

178
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,171
Thank you! Whoo!

179
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,298
"Time is money, my friend"?

180
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,174
You missed
"Takes money to make money"...

181
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:20,096
...and "Don't make me come down there
and kick your Wall Street butt."

182
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,850
I made $17 before breakfast.
What have you done?

183
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,645
I had breakfast here,
so technically I saved $3.50.

184
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,565
How did you make $17?

185
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,067
Well, my financially
challenged friends...

186
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,654
...I split my money and I bought
some shares of CHP and ZXY.

187
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,740
How come those?

188
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:43,703
Well, CHP because I used to have
a crush on Erik Estrada.

189
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,750
And ZXY because I think
it sounds "zexy."

190
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,085
Ahem, what happened to MEG?

191
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,713
MEG was good for me,
but I dumped her.

192
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,342
My motto is, "Get out before they go down."

193
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,054
That is so not my motto.

194
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,644
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

195
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,062
-Oh, hey, how's the dog?
-Yeah.

196
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,941
Okay. I talked to the vet.
People are so nice upstate.

197
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,611
He said the little fella's gonna be okay,
and I can get him tomorrow.

198
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,404
-Good.
-Oh, thank God.

199
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,823
But he did have to have
a bunch of stitches.

200
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,702
And he said that only once in a blue moon
does a dog's ear grow back.

201
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:29,040
So still hoping.

202
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:35,630
Now are you gonna call your dad
to let him know that his dog is okay?

203
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,592
I don't want to meet my father
over the phone.

204
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,262
What will I say,
"Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned.

205
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,098
Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."

206
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,726
Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.

207
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,019
Okay.

208
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,190
Listen, just don't say anything
about me, okay?

209
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,109
Don't...

210
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,362
...be too long with the phone.

211
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,325
She'll be a much better friend
once the market closes.

212
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,954
It's a woman.

213
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,580
So talk to her.

214
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,502
Uh, hello, Mrs. Buffay.

215
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,673
I know where your dog is.

216
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,719
I want you to know he'll be returned
to you almost as good as new...

217
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,388
...within 24 hours.

218
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,765
Uh, goodbye.

219
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,607
-Why the voice?
-Hard to say.

220
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,612
Your cappuccino, sir.

221
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,448
Thank you.

222
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,455
-This is better than the coffeehouse.
-Absolutely.

223
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,382
How come it's not mixing
with the water?

224
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,093
The package says to keep it moving.

225
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,804
Stir and drink, never let it settle.

226
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,103
This is ridiculous.

227
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,023
After I get back from
my niece's christening...

228
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,694
...I'll go to the coffeehouse with you
and we'll have a cup of coffee.

229
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,322
No problem. Joey's there, hmm?

230
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,408
-Okay.
-No.

231
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,285
-No?
-No.

232
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:34,415
I don't want to have to have Joey with me
every time I want decent coffee.

233
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:38,086
And I don't want to drink
cappuccino with a "k."

234
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,464
I say you and I go
and stand up to those guys.

235
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,092
All right, hang on a second there, Custer.

236
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,137
Ross, have you ever
been beaten up before?

237
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,347
Yeah, sure.

238
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,683
-By someone besides Monica?
-No.

239
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,769
So what?

240
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:58,439
So we get beaten up. Maybe that's
something a man has to go through.

241
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,901
Like a rite of passage or something.

242
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,238
Couldn't we just lose
our virginities again?

243
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,117
Because I think actually
mine's growing back.

244
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,204
-I need $100.
-What?

245
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,623
Hi. Welcome home.

246
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,500
-I need $100.
-For what?

247
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,169
-To get back in the game.
-When did you get out?

248
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,339
-I lost it all, I lost it.
-Oh, no.

249
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,633
I've come to terms with it,
you have to too.

250
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,512
Okay.

251
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,099
Look, uh, Mon, I'm really sorry.

252
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,976
Where are we on the $100?

253
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,394
I don't have it.

254
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,396
But I need it!

255
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,357
Otherwise, I'll have to take that diner job.

256
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:46,571
You know, with the dancing
and the costumes.

257
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,201
I don't want to have to wear
flame-retardant boobs.

258
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,038
Nobody does, honey.

259
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,500
Hi.

260
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,002
Noodle!

261
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,631
Oh, my God. What the hell
happened to my dog?

262
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,049
It was an accident.

263
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,469
And the woman who did this
would never hurt a dog on purpose.

264
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,472
She's a vegetarian.

265
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,016
Are these stitches?

266
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,811
Yeah, eight of them.
That's 56 to him, ha, ha.

267
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,440
If it's raining, you can't
let him look up too long...

268
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,817
...because that cone
will fill up fast.

269
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,529
Well, uh, thanks for bringing back
what's left of him.

270
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,824
-Is Frank home?
-How do you know Frank?

271
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,036
Just from a long time ago. Is he here?

272
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,372
Yeah. Frank.

273
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,625
Yeah.

274
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,335
What?

275
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,421
Oh, okay, urn, I mean Frank Senior.

276
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,881
He went out for groceries.

277
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,841
Will he be back soon?

278
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,720
He left four years ago.
We're expecting him back any minute.

279
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,057
I'm gonna go.

280
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,726
I'm sorry about the dog. Everything.

281
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,478
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,854
Hey, lady!

283
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,232
Hey, wait up!

284
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,114
-How do you know my dad?
-Urn, well, I don't really.

285
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,368
Just genetically.

286
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,954
He's kind of my dad too.

287
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,455
Heavy.

288
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,957
Yeah.

289
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,628
So, um, did he ever
talk about me? Phoebe?

290
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,381
No, but he didn't really talk
about anything.

291
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,091
Oh.

292
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,218
Except stilts.

293
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,721
-Stilts?
-Yeah, he loved stilts.

294
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,892
One time, I was upstairs stealing
cigarettes out of my mom's purse...

295
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,895
...and, uh, all of a sudden
I look over...

296
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,898
...and there's Dad's head,
bobbing past the window.

297
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,778
He just had this big smile on his face
and he was waving...

298
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,823
...because he was happiest
when he was on his stilts.

299
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,952
-Wow.
-Yeah.

300
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,454
I don't know what to do with that.

301
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,665
-Me neither, ha, ha.
-Ha, ha.

302
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,796
-So are you, like, my big sister?
-Yeah.

303
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,924
This is huge.
You can buy me beer, ha, ha.

304
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,011
-I'm not gonna.
-Oh.

305
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,889
But you know what's cool?
If you had a friend named Pete, I could say:

306
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,726
"I know Pete.
He's friends with my brother."

307
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,479
-I got a friend named Mark.
-That'll work too.

308
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,231
Cool. All right.

309
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:32,320
So maybe, you know,
I could give you a call sometime.

310
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,196
We could talk or something.

311
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,407
-Yeah, that'd be okay.
-All right.

312
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,658
I'm in the book.

313
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,369
-Okay, yeah.
-Okay, all right.

314
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,624
So, um, stilts, huh?

315
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:50,296
If you want, I can show you where
he hit his head on the rain gutter.

316
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,298
Okay.

317
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:59,388
We did it. We're here.
We are standing our ground.

318
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,976
-How long does coffee take?
-Would you come on? Come on!

319
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,563
Thank you.

320
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,035
-There we go.
-I think we proved our point.

321
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,831
-You burn your mouth?
-Cannot feel my tongue.

322
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,171
Bullies! Big bullies!

323
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,883
Oh, look who's here. It's the weenies.

324
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,346
Did we not make ourselves clear
the other day?

325
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,931
That's why we're here.

326
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,684
Yes, we're standing our ground.

327
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,852
Apparently.

328
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,771
-Let's do this already.
-Whoa, whoa.

329
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,064
You got a weapon?

330
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,067
A nice watch.
I don't want to break it on your ribs.

331
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,444
All right, let's do this.

332
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,826
Question: If I don't care about my watch,
can I use it as a weapon?

333
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,245
-What do you mean?
-It's sharp, it's metal.

334
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,248
I think I can do some
serious damage with it.

335
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,917
No, you can't use your watch.

336
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,293
Okay.

337
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,879
-Or your keys.
-Okay.

338
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,381
Here's what we'll do.

339
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,135
We'll put all keys and watches
in the hat over there.

340
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,553
-All right?
-All right.

341
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,224
All right, come on, man. Let's do it!

342
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,894
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

343
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,980
Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?

344
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,442
I have to work on Monday.
I have a big presentation.

345
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,737
Actually, I gotta show
this apartment tomorrow...

346
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,949
...and, uh, this no-faces thing
might not be a bad idea.

347
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,827
Okay, nothing from the neck up.

348
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,579
All right.

349
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,831
Or the waist down.

350
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,500
-Dana's ovulating.
-Oh, really? You guys trying again?

351
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,169
Yeah.

352
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,630
Let me get this straight.
We're talking about the middle?

353
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,507
-Come on!
-Hey, hey, whoa!

354
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,761
You want a piece of this?
I'm standing here!

355
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,429
-Huh!
-Hey, hey.

356
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,972
Those guys are taking our stuff!

357
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,390
Hey, hey!

358
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,813
God, that was amazing.
That was incredible.

359
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,900
-You guys kicked butt!
-Us? What about you guys?

360
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,028
You really, bing, gave it to
old Mr. Clean back there.

361
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,572
-He was a big guy.
-Yeah, he was, wasn't he?

362
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,200
I wouldn't know,
having missed everything.

363
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,535
Oh, don't do that to yourself.

364
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,622
Any one of us could have tripped
over that little girl's jump rope.

365
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,295
So listen, guys, are we, uh...?

366
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,172
Are we okay here?

367
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,467
-We're okay.
-Ha, ha, all right.

368
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,886
Okay, so can I have my hat back?

369
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,014
No.

370
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,266
Huh.

371
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,737
Oh, my God. Look at her.

372
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,115
Hi, Monica!

373
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,034
Ha-ha-ha, how's it going?

374
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,661
Hey, nice boobs.

375
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,455
Guys, guys. Check this out.

376
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,092

378
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,766

379
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,560
