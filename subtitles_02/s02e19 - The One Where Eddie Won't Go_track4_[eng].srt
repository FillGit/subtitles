1
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:09,885
Hey, Eddie. Aah!

2
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,389
-What are you doing here?
-Watching you sleep.

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,351
Why?

4
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,561
It makes me feel, urn, peaceful.

5
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,396
Ha, ha. Ahem. Please.

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,523
I can't sleep now!

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,900
Oh, you want me to sing?

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,527
No. Look.

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,031
That's it. I want you
out of the apartment now!

10
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,283
Oh, what are you talking about?

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,826
Hannibal Lecter?

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,621
Better roommate than you.

13
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:38,830
No.

14
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,876
I don't think you're being fair!
One night you see me, you get scared.

15
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,004
What about the other nights
when you don't see me, huh?

16
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,966
Last night you went
and got some water...

17
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,636
...and I was nice enough to hide
behind the door. What that about, huh?

18
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,180
-I didn't realize that.
-Ah.

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,474
Get out now!

20
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,227
Okay. You really want me out?

21
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,478
Yes, please.

22
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,314
Then I want to hear you say
you want me out.

23
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,774
I want you out.

24
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,651
I want to hear it from your lips.

25
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,570
Where'd you hear it before?

26
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,824
Oh, right, all right. You know what?
Consider me gone.

27
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,327
I'll be out by the time
you get home from work tomorrow.

28
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,872
<i>-Thank you.</i>
-I heard that.

29
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,468
-Thanks.
-Hey.

30
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,719
-Hey.
-Hey.

31
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,429
Well, look at you!

32
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,473
Finally got that
time machine working, huh?

33
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,100
You like it?

34
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,978
This guy was selling them
on 8th Avenue and I thought:

35
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,106
-"You know what I don't have?"
-A mirror?

36
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,027
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.

37
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,948
Wow! For a guy who's recently lost
his job, you're in a good mood.

38
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,285
I'll be all right.
I'm not starting from square one.

39
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,955
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray
on <i>Days of our Lives.</i>

40
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,958
Huh? That's got to have
some kind of cachet.

41
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,170
Cachet? Jaunty?

42
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,256
Chandler gave me
word-of-the-day toilet paper.

43
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,676
I'm gonna get some coffee.

44
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,054
-Hey.
-Hey.

45
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,681
Oh! So? Did you read the book?

46
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,101
Oh, my God. It was incredible!

47
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,811
Didn't it, like, totally speak to you?

48
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,021
-Whoa, whoa, what book is this?
-Oh.

49
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,900
Uh! You have to read this book.
It's called <i>Be Your Own Wind Keeper.</i>

50
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,986
Ooh. It's about how women need
to become more empowered.

51
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,656
And, oh! But there's wind.

52
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,077
And the wind can make us goddesses.

53
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,122
Do you know who takes our wind?
Men. They just take it.

54
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,584
Men just take our wind?

55
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:33,755
Uh-huh. All the time.
Because they are the lightning-bearers.

56
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,758
-Wow.
-Yeah.

57
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,720
That sounds kind of cool.
It's like <i>The Hobbit.</i>

58
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,097
It is nothing like <i>The Hobbit.</i>

59
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,976
It's like reading about
every relationship I've ever had.

60
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,477
Except for Richard.

61
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,646
Oh, yes. No.
Richard would never steal your wind.

62
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,231
-No.
-No.

63
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,817
-Because he's yummy.
-Yes.

64
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,152
But all the other ones.

65
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,196
Oh, and the part about how
they're always drinking...

66
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,282
...from our pool of inner power.

67
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,742
But God forbid we should take a sip.

68
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,119
Anybody want a cruller?

69
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,706
This is a typical lightning-bearer thing.

70
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,541
Right there. It's like, um...

71
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,420
..."Hello. Who wants one of
my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"

72
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,097
Don't worry about it, already!
Things happen.

73
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:29,311
So you're not mad at me
for getting fired and everything?

74
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,730
Joey, look at me.

75
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,732
Look at me!

76
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,903
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

77
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:41,990
No.

78
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,450
Uh, can we get back to me?

79
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:47,746
Look, honey. People get fired
left and right in this business.

80
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,916
I already got you an audition
for <i>Another World.</i>

81
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,501
All right!

82
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,253
"Cab Driver Number 2"?

83
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,130
You're welcome.

84
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,301
But- But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

85
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,013
How can I go from being
a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

86
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,683
Things change. Roll with them.

87
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,186
But this is a two-line part!

88
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,563
It's like taking a step backwards.

89
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,649
I'm not gonna do this.

90
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,485
Joey.

91
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,655
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told Al Minza...

92
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,199
...and his pyramid of dogs.

93
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,870
Take any job you can get,
and don't make on the floor.

94
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,415
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,084
I'll see you.

96
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,879
Uh, God!

97
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,465
Oh, God! I mean, it's just so....

98
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,925
Isn't it?

99
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,220
Uh. This is like reading
about my own life!

100
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:49,266
This book could have been called
<i>Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel!</i>

101
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,143
It wouldn't have sold
a million copies...

102
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,521
...but it would've made
a nice gift for you.

103
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,940
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey.

104
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,150
Uh, sweetie, we've gotta go.

105
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,402
No!

106
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,738
No? Hen.

107
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:08,785
No! Why do we always have to do
everything according to your timetable?

108
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,247
Actually, it's the movie theater
that has the timetable.

109
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,916
It's so you don't miss the beginning.

110
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:21,381
This isn't about the movie theater.
This is about you stealing my wind.

111
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,010
You go, girl!

112
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,140
I can't pull that off, can I?

113
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,936
Excuse me, your wind?

114
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,605
Yes, my wind.

115
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,649
How do you expect me to grow
if you won't let me blow?

116
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,909
You know I don't...

117
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,705
...have a problem with that.

118
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,214
Okay.

119
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,428
I just really need to be
with myself right now.

120
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,597
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,141
-Mm, mm, mm.
-Uh, you're right.

122
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,684
I don't have to apologize.

123
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,187
Sorry. Damn it!

124
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,487
-What is it?
-I don't know.

125
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,531
It's got all this stuff
about wind and trees...

126
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,283
...and some sacred pool.

127
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,745
I don't really get it.
But she's pretty upset about it.

128
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,748
This is why I don't date
women who read.

129
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,542
Uh-oh.

130
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,044
What? What's that?

131
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,380
It's my VISA bill.

132
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,882
Envelope one of two.

133
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,762
-That can't be good.
-Open it, open it.

134
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,017
-Oh, my God!
-Whoa!

135
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,269
Look at this!
How did I spend so much money?

136
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:02,607
Uh, that's just the minimum amount.
That's your total.

137
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,609
Aah!

138
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:09,197
Whoa, whoa. Thirty-five hundred dollars
at "Porcelain Safari"?

139
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,782
My animals.

140
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,161
The guy said they suited me. He spoke
with an accent. I was confused.

141
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,830
Oh.

142
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,665
I don't know what to do!

143
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,835
You can start by driving a cab
on <i>Another World.</i>

144
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,795
-What?
-That audition?

145
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,755
That's a two-line part!

146
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:30,093
Joey, you owe $1100
at "I Love Lucite."

147
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,637
-So what?
-So suck it up, man.

148
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,389
It's a job. It's money.

149
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:38,435
I don't need you getting judgmental
and condescending and pedantic.

150
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,021
-Toilet paper?
-Yeah.

151
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,901
I'm not being any of those things.
I'm being realistic.

152
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,988
-You're supposed to be my friend!
-I am your friend.

153
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,240
Then tell me things like,
"You'll be fine."

154
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,660
And "Something big's gonna
come along. I know it!"

155
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,162
But I don't know it.

156
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,874
What I do know is you owe $2300
at "Isn't It Chromantic?"

157
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,294
I'm aware of what I owe.

158
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:08,298
Then get some sense.
It took you 10 years to get that job.

159
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,342
-How long till you get another?
-I don't want to hear this!

160
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,594
I'm just saying....

161
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,929
Well, don't "just say"!

162
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,850
Oh. Maybe I should just go.

163
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,435
Okay.

164
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:21,686
Okay.

165
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,396
I'll see you later.

166
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,316
Just think about it.

167
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,401
I don't need to think about it!

168
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,862
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

169
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,906
That was huge!

170
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,617
Big things are gonna happen!
You'll see!

171
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,910
Ross!

172
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,953
You still there?

173
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,467
-Hey, pal.
-Oh, God!

174
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,845
What are you still doing here?

175
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,973
Uh, just some basic dehydrating
of fruits and vegetables.

176
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,684
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!

177
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,771
Aren't you forgetting anything?

178
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,106
Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.

179
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,234
He's feistier than the last one.

180
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,529
Maybe because the last one
was made by Pepperidge Farm.

181
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,742
Eddie, isn't there something else
you're supposed to be doing now?

182
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,411
Not unless it's got something
to do with dehydrating.

183
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,413
Because right now,
I'm a dehydrating maniac!

184
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,877
I thought we had a deal.

185
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,712
-I thought by the time I got—
-Uh, uh.

186
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,005
You know what that is?

187
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,924
Your last roommate's kidney?

188
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,678
That's a tomato. Ha, ha.

189
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,763
This one definitely goes in the display.

190
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,102
It's in the display.

191
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,776
Hey, Gunther.
Let me get a, uh, lemonade to go.

192
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,361
Lemonade?

193
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,071
You okay, man?

194
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,574
Ann, it's career stuff.

195
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,493
They killed off
my character on the show.

196
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,413
Oh, that's too bad.
How'd they do it?

197
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,540
I fell down an elevator shaft.

198
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,876
Oh. That sucks.

199
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,752
I was buried in an avalanche.

200
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,380
What?

201
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,133
I used to be Brice on <i>All My Children.</i>

202
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,740
Why must everybody watch me sleep?

203
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,618
There'll be no more
watching me sleep! No more...

204
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,869
-...watching!
-I-

205
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,370
Neh.

206
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,712
I got some great stuff to dehydrate.
Grapes, apricots.

207
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,424
I thought it'd be cool to see
what happens with these water balloons.

208
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,677
Get out.
Get out, get out, get out!

209
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,931
-What?
-You! Move out!

210
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:07,268
Take your fruit!
Your stupid small fruit and get out!

211
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,437
You want me to move out? Uh....

212
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,151
Uh-huh.

213
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,695
Heh. I, uh-

214
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:22,200
Ooh! Ha, ha. I gotta tell you, that's kind
of out of the blue, don't you think?

215
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,203
This is not out of the blue!

216
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,580
This is smack-dab
in the middle of the blue!

217
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,415
Whoa!

218
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,085
Relax! Take it easy, buddy!

219
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,087
You don't have to tell me twice.

220
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,715
God, I mean, someone will be by
for my stuff.

221
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,224
If you think I'm leaving you
alone with my fish, you're insane!

222
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,601
You want some help?

223
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,687
No help required, <i>chico!</i>

224
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,740
All the way to the airport, huh?
You know, that's over 30 miles.

225
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,244
That's gonna cost you about so bucks.

226
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,663
Excuse me, that's "50" bucks.

227
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,834
-What?
-Five-0 dollars.

228
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:17,714
Oh. You know what it is?
It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

229
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,842
When I was on <i>Days of our Lives
</i>as Dr. Drake Ramoray...

230
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,345
...they'd send over
the whole script on real paper.

231
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,432
Ha, ha. That's great.

232
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,686
If you wanted to expand this scene,
like have the cab crash...

233
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,771
...I could attend to the victims...

234
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,065
...because I have a background
in medical acting.

235
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,277
Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.

236
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,656
No. Uh, don't thank me for coming in.
Uh, at least let me finish.

237
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,995
Uh, we could take the expressway...

238
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:53,666
...but, uh, this time of day
you're better off taking the budge.

239
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,547
You were going for bridge there,
weren't you?

240
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,632
I'll have a good day.

241
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,473
Okay, question number 28.

242
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,769
"Have you ever allowed
a lightning-bearer to take your wind?"

243
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,271
I would have to say no.

244
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,525
And I would have to say, "Pah, ha."

245
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,652
What?

246
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,571
Do you not remember the puppet guy?

247
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:28,743
You totally let him wash his feet
in the pool of your inner power.

248
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,996
And his puppet too!

249
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,373
Well, at least I didn't let some guy...

250
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,502
...into the forest of my righteous truth
on the first date!

251
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,216
-Who?
-Paul!

252
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,801
Oh!

253
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,179
Okay, okay, moving on, moving on.
Next question.

254
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,889
Okay, number 29.

255
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,059
"Have you ever betrayed
another goddess...

256
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,229
...for a lightning-bearer?"
Okay, number 30.

257
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,315
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's go back to 29.

258
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,819
Not, uh....

259
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,238
Ahem. Not to my recollection.

260
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,075
Danny Arshack, ninth grade.

261
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,869
You know the bottle
was pointing at me.

262
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,789
Only because you took up
half the circle!

263
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,212
Listen to you two. It's so sad.

264
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,505
Oh!

265
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,924
Looks like I'll be going to
the goddess meetings alone.

266
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,467
Mm.

267
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,720
Not when they find out
you slept with Jason...

268
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,640
...an hour after
he broke up with Monica.

269
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,102
One hour?

270
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,689
-You are such a leaf blower!
-Oh!

271
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,859
Ugh!

272
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,154
Ugh.

273
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,580
Oh, hey, uh,
be careful with that 3-D <i>Last Supper.</i>

274
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,541
Judas is a little loose.

275
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,797
Oh, my God! What's going on?

276
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,260
They're taking all my stuff back.
I guess you were right.

277
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,597
No, I wasn't right.
That's what I came here to tell you.

278
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,268
I was totally hung up
on my own stuff the other day.

279
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:21,189
No, listen. I need the whole
security thing, you know?

280
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,776
To know where my next paycheck is
coming from. But you don't need that.

281
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,737
And that's amazing to me.

282
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,239
I could never do what you do.

283
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,910
-Thanks.
-You hold out for something bigger.

284
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,204
I can't tell you
how much respect I have...

285
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,332
...for you not going
to that stupid audition.

286
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,167
-I went.
-Great! How did it go?

287
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,711
-I didn't get it.
-Good for you!

288
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,129
You're living the dream!

289
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,797
-Huh?
-Ha, ha.

290
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,841
All right, then!

291
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,928
-Oh, not my parrot.
-What?

292
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,931
I can't watch this.

293
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,642
Hey, hold on, hold on.

294
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,896
How much for the, uh...?
How much to save the bird?

295
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,940
-Twelve hundred.
-Dollars?

296
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,901
You spent $1200 on a plastic bird?

297
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,071
Uh, it was an impulse buy.
Near the register.

298
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,990
Go ahead with the bird.

299
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:17,537
-Do you have anything for around $200?
-Uh.

300
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,205
The dog.

301
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,707
-Huh?
-Yeah.

302
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:24,794
I'll take it.

303
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,712
My gift to you, man.

304
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,383
Thanks, Ross!

305
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,677
I really liked that bird, though.

306
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,930
-But the dog! Oh!
-Yeah. Right?

307
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,815
Here are your cakes.

308
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,316
We didn't order cake.

309
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,611
No, I know. Ahem. They're from me.

310
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,155
You guys, this is not good.

311
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,866
We have enough trouble
with guys stealing our wind...

312
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,160
...without taking it from each other.

313
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,204
-You're right.
-You know?

314
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,665
I love you goddesses.

315
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,251
I love you.

316
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,169
I don't ever want
to suck your wind again.

317
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,838
Oh.

318
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,465
-Thank you. So are we good?
-Oh. We're good.

319
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,758
-We're good?
-Yes.

320
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,470
Okay. Let me take these back.
They'll take it out of my paycheck.

321
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,684
Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!

322
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,940
-Are you sure this time?
-Yes.

323
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,026
I actually saw him leave.

324
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,611
That guy is holding a human head.

325
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,448
He's holding a human head!

326
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:38,993
Check it out, man!

327
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,330
I tore it off a mannequin
in the alley behind Macy's. Ha, ha.

328
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,873
There is no alley behind Macy's.

329
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,542
So I got it in the junior miss
department. Big diff.

330
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,463
It'll make a hell of a conversation piece
at our next cocktail party, huh?

331
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,548
"Our next cocktail party"?

332
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,719
Yeah, you know, we'll put chips in it.
We'll make it a chip chick.

333
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,391
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?

334
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,685
Uh, yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

335
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,902
Ahem. Do you remember
talking to me yesterday?

336
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,278
Uh, yes.

337
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,659
So, what happened?

338
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,870
We took a road trip to Las Vegas!

339
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,955
Oh, sweet Moses!

340
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,168
So on this road trip,
uh, did you win any money?

341
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,588
Nah, I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here!
He cleans up!

342
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,091
$300! He buys me these new shoes.
Sweet, huh?

343
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,759
Nice.

344
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,053
Uh, see you upstairs. See you, pals!

345
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,975
Is anyone else starting
to really like him?

346
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,831
May I help you?

347
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,335
Why doesn't my key work,
and what's my stuff doing downstairs?

348
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,380
I'm sorry. Aah.

349
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,298
Have we met?

350
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,801
It's Eddie, you freak!
Your roommate.

351
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,387
I'm sorry, I, uh...

352
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,390
...I already have a roommate.

353
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,727
Hello.

354
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,943
Um, he's lived here for years.
I don't know what you're talking about.

355
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,987
No, no. He's, uh....

356
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,241
No, he moved out and I moved in.

357
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,703
Well, I think we'd remember
something like that.

358
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,457
I know I would. Ha, ha.

359
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,376
That's, uh, a good point. Um....

360
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,044
Okay, wow. Huh.

361
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,505
I guess I got the wrong apartment.

362
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,550
Look, I'm-

363
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,011
-I'm terribly sorry.
-Hey, no problem.

364
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,387
See you.

365
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:13,230
Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.

366
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:18,611
-You want me to help you unpack?
-Nah, I'm okay. Oh, and, uh....

367
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,490
Just so you know, I'm not
moving back in because I have to.

368
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,409
I mean, I do have to, but....

369
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,788
It's just that that place,
it wasn't really....

370
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,789
I mean, this is....

371
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,709
Welcome home, man.

372
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,679
-A little foos?
-Absolutely!

373
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,059
What happened to the foosball?

374
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,186
It's a cantaloupe.

375
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,236
Are we gonna bring this out
every time Ross comes over?

376
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,987
He paid a lot of money for it.

377
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,038
-I'm gonna hold him a different way.
-All right.

378
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,960
If you hated it so much,
why'd you buy it in the first place?

379
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,047
Well, I had a whole ceramic-zoo thing
going over there.

380
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,716
But without the other ones,
it looks tacky.

381
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,221
Is he housetrained or will he leave
little bathroom tiles all over?

382
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,223
Stay.

383
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,059
Uh, stay!

384
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,436
Good fake dog.
