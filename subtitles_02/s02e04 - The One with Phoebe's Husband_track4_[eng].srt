1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:05,047
Mom, would you relax?

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,176
That was 10 blocks from here,
and the woman was walking alone at night.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,011
I would never do that.

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,847
Mom, come on, stop worrying.

5
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:17,392
This is a safe street.
This is a safe building. There's nothing-

6
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,604
Aah! Oh, my God!
What are you doing in here?

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,606
Mom, I gotta go. I gotta go.

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,944
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,946
Okay.

10
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,198
That's fine, you just read the paper.

11
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,825
I'm gonna get a pot.

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,119
It's not for you.

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,835
Okay, that's fine.

14
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,798
Read the <i>Family Circus...</i>

15
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,343
...enjoy the gentle comedy....

16
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:58,016
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,398
Ugh. Oh, God. Oh, God.

18
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,695
It's open, you guys.

19
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,198
-Hi.
-Hi. Can I help you?

20
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,617
I'm looking for Phoebe,
does she still live here?

21
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,161
Uh, no, she doesn't.
But I can get a message to her.

22
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,206
Great. Uh, just tell her
her husband stopped by.

23
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,958
Her what? Aah!

24
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,837
Hey, how did you do that?

25
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,973
This is unbelievable, Pheebs.
How can you be married?

26
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,059
I'm not "married" married,
you know?

27
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,935
He was just a friend, and he's gay...

28
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,813
...and he was from Canada,
and he needed a Green Card.

29
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,066
I can't believe you married Duncan.

30
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,692
I mean, how could you not tell me?

31
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,986
We lived together,
we told each other everything.

32
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:36,823
I'm sorry, Monica, but I knew if I told you,
you'd get really, like, judgmental...

33
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,033
...and would not approve.

34
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,202
Of course I wouldn't approve.

35
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,538
You were totally in love
with this guy who, hello, was gay.

36
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,540
I mean, what the hell were you thinking?

37
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,709
See? And you thought
she'd be judgmental.

38
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:53,090
Okay, I wasn't in love with him.
I was just helping out a friend.

39
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,676
Please. When he left town,
you stayed in your pajamas for a month.

40
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,845
And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

41
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,600
Well, didn't you?

42
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,228
I might have.

43
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,439
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

44
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,108
Come on.
Like you tell me everything?

45
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,068
What have I not told you?

46
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,195
Ooh, I don't know. Um...

47
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,366
...how about the fact that the underwear
out there on the telephone pole is yours...

48
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,119
...from when you were having sex
with Fun Bobby on the terrace.

49
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,622
-What?
-Wait a minute. Who told you?

50
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,920
You are dead meat.

51
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,798
I didn't know it was a big secret.

52
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,134
Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

53
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,804
You know, kind of on the same lines as,
say, I don't know, having a third nipple.

54
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,851
You have a third nipple?

55
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,771
You bitch.

56
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,609
-Whip it out. Whip it out.
-Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:59,072
No, come on. There's nothing to see.
It's just a tiny bump. It's totally useless.

58
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,533
Oh, as opposed to your other
multifunctional nipples?

59
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,164
I can't believe you.
You told me it was a nubbin.

60
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,042
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

61
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,881
I don't know. You see something, you
hear a word, I thought that's what it was.

62
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,801
-Let me see it again.
-Yeah, show us your nubbin.

63
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,178
Joey was in a porno movie.

64
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,976
If I'm going down,
I'm taking everybody with me.

65
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,229
-Oh, my God.
-You were in a porno?

66
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,691
All right, all right.
I was young and I just wanted a job, okay?

67
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,985
But at the last minute
I couldn't go through with it.

68
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,322
So they let me be the guy who comes in
to fix the copier but can't...

69
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,200
...because there's people
having sex on it.

70
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,701
Wow.

71
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,077
That is wild.

72
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,581
-So, what's it shaped like?
-Is there a hair on it?

73
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,750
What happens if you flick it?

74
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,802
So, uh, does it do anything,
you know, special?

75
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,389
Why, yes, Ross, pressing my third nipple
opens the delivery entrance...

76
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,850
...to the magical land of Narnia.

77
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,523
You know, in some cultures, having
a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.

78
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,526
You get the best huts,
and women dance naked around you.

79
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:22,197
Huh. Are, uh, any of these cultures,
per chance, in the Tri-State area?

80
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:27,410
You know, you are so amazing.
Is there anything you don't know?

81
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:32,832
Ooh, Julie's so smart. Julie's so special.

82
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,836
Look, honey, I wanted you to hook up
with Ross as much as you did.

83
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,465
But he's with her now.
You're just gonna have to get over it.

84
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,468
Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.

85
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,264
God, see, I didn't know that's what
I had to do. I just have to get over it.

86
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,018
Whoa.

87
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,396
-Sassy lady.
-Where are you going?

88
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,983
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan.
He's skating tonight at the Garden.

89
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,151
He's in the Capades.

90
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,406
-The Ice Capades?
-No, no, the Gravel Capades.

91
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,119
Yeah, the turns aren't as fast,
but when Snoopy falls? Funny.

92
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,497
I can't believe you're dressing up for him.

93
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,125
You're setting yourself up
all over again.

94
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,501
Okay, no.

95
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:22,591
For your information, I'm going to see him
so I can put all those feelings behind me.

96
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,678
And the reason I'm dressed like this
is because I think it's nice...

97
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,347
...to look nice for your gay husband.

98
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,476
Darn it, we're all out of milk.

99
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,812
Hey, Chandler, will you fill me up here?

100
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,739
Oh, I see, I see.
Because of the third-nipple thing.

101
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,249
-Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.
-Bye.

102
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,629
-See you later, Rach.
-Bye-bye, Julie.

103
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,512
-Hey.
-Hey.

104
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,141
Hey, come on, cut it out.

105
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,061
-Hey.
-What?

106
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,689
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

107
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,734
-Eh.
-What?

108
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,696
-Come on, talk to me.
-Okay.

109
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,910
What's the longest you've been
in a relationship before...

110
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,206
...having the sex?

111
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,001
Why? Who's not-?
Are you and Julie not-?

112
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,212
Are you and Julie not having sex?

113
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,464
Well....

114
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,299
Technically?

115
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,552
-No.
-Wow.

116
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,138
Is it because she's so cold in bed?

117
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,395
Or is it because she's kind of bossy,
makes it feel like school?

118
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:03,358
No. No. She's great. And it's not
like we haven't done anything.

119
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:08,029
I mean, we do plenty of other stuff.
Lots of other stuff like-

120
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,865
No, no, no.
Don't need to know the details.

121
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,202
No, it's just....

122
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,162
It's me.

123
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,457
You know, I've only been
with one woman my whole life...

124
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,876
...and she turned out to be a lesbian.

125
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,086
Uh-huh.

126
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,756
So now I've got myself all psyched out.

127
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,467
It's become, like, this...

128
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,679
...this thing, and I....

129
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,058
You must just think I'm weird.

130
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,103
No. No, no, no. I don't think it's weird.

131
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,856
I think- I think, um, in fact-

132
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,525
-In fact, you know what I think?
-What?

133
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,986
I think it's sexy.

134
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,488
Sexy?

135
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,866
Let me tell you something.
As a woman...

136
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,161
...there is nothing sexier...

137
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,080
...than a man who does not
want to have sex.

138
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,710
-No kidding.
-Oh, yeah. In fact, you know what I'd do?

139
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,336
I'd wait.

140
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:10,133
-You'd wait?
-Yes, absolutely. I would wait...

141
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,427
...and wait....

142
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,138
Then I'd wait some more.

143
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,641
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

144
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,811
I don't care how much she tells you
she wants it, I don't care if she begs...

145
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:26,816
...she pleads, she tells you
she's gonna have sex with another man.

146
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,693
That just means it's working.

147
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,324
Women really want this?

148
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,326
More than jewelry.

149
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,927
Hi.

150
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,221
-Phoebe.
-Ta-da.

151
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,765
Hi.

152
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,309
Ah, look at you. You look great.

153
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,812
Do I? Thank you.

154
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,856
-So do you. Sparkly.
-Thanks.

155
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,151
So....

156
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:15,573
Wow. This is pretty wonderful, huh,
Mr. Major Capades Guy.

157
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:21,496
I remember when you were just like
King Friday in Mr. Roger's <i>Ice Is Nice.</i>

158
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,791
You always said I'd make it.

159
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,378
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm kind of spooky that way. Woo.

160
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,214
God, I missed you.

161
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,803
-I'm gonna get changed.
-Okay.

162
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,765
Um, now.

163
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,393
-What?
-Pheebs.

164
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,687
Oh. Right. Okay.

165
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,982
<i>-Ole.
</i>-What?

166
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,985
The Matador, so....

167
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,283
<i>Ole. </i>Ha, ha.

168
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,330
-Sweetie, can you hold this for a second?
-Sure.

169
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,957
Thanks.

170
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,049
-Uh, Julie?
-Yeah.

171
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,177
Sorry, you had a paleontologist
on your face.

172
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,139
But, uh, it's gone now. You're all right.

173
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,974
-Hi, everyone.
-Hi.

174
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,226
Oh, listen, listen....

175
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:29,272
I wanted to thank you
for, uh, our little talk before.

176
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,942
Oh, God, no problem.
So you're gonna go with the waiting thing?

177
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,613
Well, I was going to,
but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

178
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,286
Good. Ahem. What did he say?

179
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,205
Basically, he told me to get over myself
and just do it.

180
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,918
So I thought about what you said
and about what he said.

181
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,629
And, well, his way,
I get to have sex tonight, so....

182
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,679
What is this in my pocket?

183
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,557
Why, it's Joey's porno movie.

184
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,311
Pop it in.

185
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,606
I'm fine with it, I mean,
if you're okay watching a video...

186
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,067
...filled with two-nippled people.

187
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,281
Great. People having sex.
That's just what I need to see.

188
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,742
What's wrong with people having sex?

189
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,744
Well....

190
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,124
Well, um, you know,
these movies are offensive...

191
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:34,796
...and, uh, degrading
to women and females....

192
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,092
And, uh, the lighting's
always unflattering.

193
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,512
And....

194
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:46,015
-Monica, help me out here.
-Hell, I wanna see Joey.

195
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,608
So is there, like, a story,
or do they just start doing it right-

196
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,070
Oh. Never mind.

197
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,991
Okay, now, wait a minute. That is the
craziest typing test I've ever seen.

198
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,078
All I say is, she better get the job.

199
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,497
Looks to me like he's the one
getting the job.

200
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,960
Shh. Hey, here I come. Here I come.

201
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,962
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.

202
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,966
I can't get to the copier. I'm thinking,
"What do I do? What do I do?"

203
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,095
So I just watch them have sex.

204
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,058
And then I say- Here's my line.

205
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,853
<i>You know, that's bad for the paper tray.</i>

206
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,857
-Nice work, my friend.
-Thank you.

207
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,944
Wait, you see me again.
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

208
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,991
There I am. There I am. There I am.

209
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,251
So, urn- So, what's up?
You came to see me yesterday.

210
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,295
Oh, yeah, um....

211
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,839
All right.

212
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,384
I kind of need a divorce.

213
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,679
Okay.

214
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,181
How come?

215
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,185
Um, actually, I'm getting married again.

216
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,603
What?

217
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,813
Oh, God,
I don't know how to tell you this.

218
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,359
I'm straight.

219
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,653
Yeah, I know.

220
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,158
I don't understand. I don't understand.
How can you be straight?

221
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,827
I mean, you're so smart and funny...

222
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,914
...and you throw
such great Academy Award parties.

223
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,500
I know. That's what I kept telling myself.

224
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,544
But you just reach a point
where you can't live a lie anymore.

225
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,757
So how long have you known?

226
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,887
I guess on some level
I always knew I was straight.

227
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,932
I thought I was supposed
to be something else.

228
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,895
You know, I'm an ice dancer, all my
friends are gay. I was just trying to fit in.

229
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,859
And, urn-- And there's actually a woman?

230
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,488
-Her name's Debra.
-Oh.

231
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,451
Well, is she the first
that you've been with?

232
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,871
Well, I've never told you this...

233
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:19,585
...but there were one or two times
back in college...

234
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,921
...when I'd get really drunk
and go to a straight bar...

235
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,382
...and wake up with a woman next to me.

236
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:29,762
But I told myself it was the liquor,
and everyone experiments in college.

237
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,348
Sure.

238
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,768
But now I know I don't have a choice
about this. I was born this way.

239
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,232
I don't know what to say.

240
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,402
I mean, you know,
you're married to someone for six years...

241
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,070
...and you think you know him.

242
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,282
And then one day he says,
"Oh, I'm not gay."

243
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,873
I'm- I'm still me.

244
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,420
Why couldn't you just have
figured this out six years ago?

245
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,633
You know,
it still smells like monkey in there.

246
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,221
Well, that saves us the conversation.

247
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,809
Well, this has been great,
but I'm officially wiped.

248
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,270
-Me too. We should get going.
-No.

249
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,106
No. I mean- No. Come on, you guys.

250
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,776
Come on, look, it's only 11:30.

251
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:30,156
Let's just talk. We never just
hang out and talk anymore.

252
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,867
Rachel, that's all we do.

253
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,246
Maybe that's all we do.
What about Julie?

254
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,166
What about Julie?

255
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,378
Well, you have been in our lives
for nearly two months now...

256
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,881
...and we don't really know you.

257
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,674
I mean, who is Julie?

258
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,303
I mean, what do you like?
What don't you like?

259
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,722
We want to know everything.

260
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,974
Well, heh, that could take a while.

261
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,726
So?

262
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,105
I mean, who here does not have
the time to get to know Julie?

263
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,359
-I got the time to get to know Julie.
-I got time, yeah.

264
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,696
Uh, Rach, ahem, I know her pretty well.
Can I go?

265
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,867
That's fine.

266
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:18,746
Okay, Julie, so let's start with
your childhood. What was that like?

267
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,167
-Well, in a nutshell-
-Ah-ah-ah.

268
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,339
So, um, have you told your parents?

269
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,842
No, but it'll be okay. They're pretty cool.

270
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,387
My brother's straight, so....

271
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,306
Here you go.

272
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,059
You know what?
I just have one more question. Um....

273
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:45,439
If you had figured this out sooner,
and, um, I had been around...

274
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,442
...do you think I would have been
the one who...?

275
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,487
No, no. That's all right. Don't tell me.

276
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,700
I don't think either answer
would make me feel better. Here.

277
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,869
I love you, Phoebe.

278
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,512
So your brother's straight, huh?

279
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,265
Seriously.

280
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:26,105
-and my second-grade teacher
was Miss Thomas...

281
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,983
...and my first-grade teacher
was Mrs. Cobb.

282
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,319
Ahem. Mrs. Gobb?

283
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,404
No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

284
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,781
Hmm, okay.

285
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,452
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?

286
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,120
I'm going home.

287
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,627
Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

288
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,964
Good night.

289
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,175
Whew.

290
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:58,679
So it's pretty late. You're probably, uh,
not still planning on....

291
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,349
-Oh. No, no, I am.
-Oh.

292
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,602
Well, hey, are you nervous?

293
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,896
No, no. I, uh-

294
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,939
I have done it before.

295
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,693
Well, okay, I mean,
how are you gonna handle it?

296
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:17,031
Are you gonna talk about it beforehand?
Are you just gonna pounce?

297
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,534
I, uh- I don't know.
I guess I'm just gonna...

298
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,454
...see what happens.

299
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,582
Okay. Good luck.

300
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,501
What-? Uh....

301
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,922
-What?
-Nothing. I mean, um....

302
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:38,594
It is your first time with her, and, you know,
if the first time doesn't go well...

303
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,223
...well then, that's pretty darn
hard to recover from.

304
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,394
Okay, now I'm nervous.

305
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,564
Maybe you should put it off.

306
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,484
No, I don't want to put it off.

307
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:01,200
God, I'm just- I spent last year
being so unbelievably miserable.

308
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,328
And now I'm actually happy.

309
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,249
You know, I mean, really happy.

310
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,626
I just don't wanna....

311
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,921
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

312
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,258
I know.

313
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,468
Yeah.

314
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,846
I'm sorry.

315
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,140
No, it's not your fault.

316
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,599
Right.

317
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,396
Maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.

318
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,110
Maybe you were on the right track with
that whole, you know, spontaneous thing.

319
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,363
-I mean, women really like that.
-Really?

320
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,032
Yeah. I mean, you know, if-

321
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,536
I mean if it were me, I'd, you know,
want you to-

322
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,705
-What?
-I don't know, catch me off guard.

323
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,999
You know, with, like, a really...

324
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,042
...good kiss.

325
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,545
You know, really...

326
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:58,757
...sort of, um, soft at first.

327
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:04,805
And then maybe, um,
brush the hair away from my face.

328
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:09,393
And then look far into my eyes...

329
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,313
...in a way that lets me
know something...

330
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,816
...amazing is about to happen.

331
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,902
Uh-huh.

332
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,366
And then, I don't know, then...

333
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,495
...you'd pull me
really close to you so that-

334
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,290
So that I'd be pressed up, you know,
right against you.

335
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:35,878
And, um, it would get kind of...

336
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,215
...sweaty...

337
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,927
...and, uh- And blurry.

338
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,182
And then it's just happening.

339
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,935
Oh.

340
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,483
Thanks, Rach. Good night.

341
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,197
Oh, God.

342
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,173
Good morning.

343
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,344
Well, somebody got some last night.

344
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,600
Twice.
