1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,426
Man, I sure miss Julie.

2
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,428
Spanish midgets.

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,765
Spanish midgets wrestling....

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,518
Julie.
Okay, yes, I see how you got there.

5
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,486
You ever figure out
what that thing's for?

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,655
No, see, I'm trying this screening thing.

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,533
I figure if I always answer the phone,
people will think I don't have a life.

8
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,036
My God.
Rodrigo never gets pinned.

9
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,914
<i>Here comes the beep. You know what to do.</i>

10
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,958
<i>Hello. I'm looking for Bob.</i>

11
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,334
<i>This is Jade.</i>

12
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,754
<i>/ don't know if you're still at this number,
but I was just thinking about us...</i>

13
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:50,050
<i>...and how great it was, and, well,
I know it's been three years...</i>

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,678
<i>...but I was kind of hoping
we could hook up again.</i>

15
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,889
<i>You know, I barely had the nerve
to make this call...</i>

16
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,308
<i>-...so you know what I did?
</i>-What?

17
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,519
<i>/ got a little drunk...</i>

18
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,728
<i>...and naked.</i>

19
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,230
Bob here.

20
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,740
So, uh, what have you been up to?

21
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,617
<i>Oh, you know, the usual.</i>

22
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,160
<i>Teaching aerobics...</i>

23
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,204
<i>...partying way too much. Heh.</i>

24
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,290
<i>Oh, and in case you were wondering...</i>

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,461
<i>...those are my legs
on the new James Bond poster.</i>

26
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,883
Can you hold on a moment?
I have another call.

27
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,760
-I love her.
-I know.

28
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,139
-I'm back.
-<i>So are we gonna get together?</i>

29
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,766
Uh, absolutely.

30
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,642
Uh, how about tomorrow afternoon?

31
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,562
Do you know, uh, Central Perk
in the village? Say, five-ish?

32
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,648
-<i>Great. I'll see you then.
</i>-Okay.

33
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,777
Okay.

34
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,529
Having a phone has finally paid off.

35
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,117
Even though you do
do a good Bob impression...

36
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,119
...I'm thinking when
she sees you tomorrow...

37
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,622
...she's probably gonna realize, hey,
you're not Bob.

38
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,209
I am hoping that when
Bob doesn't show up...

39
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:52,339
...she will seek comfort in the open arms
of the wry stranger at the next table.

40
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,300
Oh, my God. You are pure evil.

41
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,178
Okay, pure evil...

42
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,639
...horny and alone.

43
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,060
I've done this.

44
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,360
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here.

45
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,822
Hey, everybody.
Say hi to Julie in New Mexico.

46
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,031
Hi, Julie.

47
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,783
Hi, Julie.

48
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,245
Okay. While Ross is on the phone...

49
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,414
...everybody owes me
62 bucks for his birthday.

50
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:30,293
Um, is there any chance
that you're rounding up from...

51
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,840
...you know, from like 20?

52
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,802
Hey, come on, we got the gift,
the concert and the cake.

53
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,721
Do we need a cake?

54
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,849
Look, I know it's a little steep.

55
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,517
Whoosh.

56
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,603
But it's Ross.

57
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,232
-Yeah, it's Ross.
-Yeah, you're right.

58
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,693
All right? Okay. I'll see you later.
I gotta go...

59
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,570
...do a thing.

60
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,781
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll call you later tonight.

61
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,909
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, you're not
really going through with this, are you?

62
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,537
You know, I think I might just.

63
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,709
So, uh, what are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

64
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,963
Well, I guess I gotta start
saving up for Ross' birthday.

65
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,842
So I guess I'll just stay home
and eat dust bunnies.

66
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,470
Can you believe how much
this is gonna cost?

67
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,931
Do you guys ever get the feeling
that, urn...

68
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,558
...Chandler and those guys...

69
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,936
...just don't get that we don't make
as much money as they do?

70
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,313
-Yes.
-Really?

71
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,316
It's like they're always saying,
"Let's go here, let's go there."

72
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,736
-Like we can afford to go here and there.
-Yeah.

73
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:42,115
Yes, and we always have to go to,
you know, someplace nice, you know?

74
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:47,162
It's not like we can say anything about it,
because, like, this is a birthday thing...

75
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,747
...you know, and it's for Ross.

76
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,415
-For Ross.
-For Ross.

77
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,294
Oh, my God.

78
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,629
-Hi.
-What?

79
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,631
Okay. I'm at work...

80
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,009
...just an ordinary day, you know,
chop, chop, saute, saute.

81
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,971
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager,
calls me into his office.

82
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:08,183
Turns out they fired the head lunch chef,
and guess who got the job.

83
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,186
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.

84
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,731
-Fortunately, it is me.
-Oh.

85
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,359
And they made me head of purchasing,
thank you very much.

86
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,194
That's so cool.

87
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,614
Anyway, I just ran into Chandler and Ross.
We should go out and celebrate.

88
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,865
You know, someplace nice.

89
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,873
-Someplace nice.
-Yeah.

90
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,834
How much you think
I can get for my kidney?

91
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,301
I'm telling you, you can't do this.

92
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,514
Oh, come on, I can't get a girl like that
with conventional methods.

93
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,807
That doesn't matter.

94
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,350
She wanted to call Bob.

95
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,895
Hey, for all we know,
Bob is who she was meant to be with.

96
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,023
You may be destroying
two people's chance for happiness.

97
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,733
We don't know Bob.

98
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,154
Okay? We know me. We like me.
Please let me be happy.

99
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,492
Go over there
and tell that woman the truth.

100
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,661
All right.

101
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,163
Go.

102
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,672
Hi.

103
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,257
Hi.

104
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,093
Listen, I have to, uh, ahem-

105
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,220
I have to confess something.

106
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,514
Yes?

107
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,727
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

108
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,771
-How did you-
-I don't know.

109
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,194
I just had this weird sense. You know?
But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

110
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,365
Tissue?

111
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,409
Thanks.

112
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,746
No, no, you keep the pack.

113
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,081
I'm all cried out today.

114
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,013
Okay, okay.

115
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,392
Here is to my sister,
the newly appointed head lunch chef.

116
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,561
Who is also in charge of purchasing.

117
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,689
Newly appointed head lunch chef,
also in charge of purchasing-

118
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,193
Who has her own little desk
when Roland's not there.

119
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,822
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing,
own little desk when Roland's not there...

120
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,117
-...here's to my little sister-
-Oh, wait. And I got a beeper.

121
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,535
Oh, cool.

122
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,248
-That's fine, I'll just wait.
-Aw, sorry.

123
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,042
Oh, sorry, sorry.

124
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,752
Monica.

125
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,173
Are we ready to order?

126
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,008
Oh. You know,
we haven't even looked yet.

127
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,885
Well, when you do, just let me know.

128
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,012
I'll be right over there
on the edge of my seat.

129
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,937
Wow, look at these prices.

130
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,773
Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching."

131
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,777
I know. What are these,
famous chickens?

132
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,739
-Sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.
-Thanks.

133
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,076
I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible
was my afternoon with Jade?

134
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:17,664
Well, pretty incredible, according to
the message she left on my machine.

135
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:22,627
Hey, Chandler, why is this woman
leaving a message for you on my machine?

136
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,963
See, I had to tell her
that my number was your number.

137
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,923
I couldn't tell her
my number was my number...

138
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,135
...because she thinks
my number is Bob's number.

139
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,931
Hey, tell me again.
What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

140
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,726
Do I dare ask?

141
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,354
Yes, I'll start with the carpaccio,
and then I'll have the grilled prawns.

142
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,897
That sounds great, same for me.

143
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,941
And for the gentleman?

144
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,776
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.

145
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,113
But, hey, look, if I get it without
the nuts and leeks and stuff...

146
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,240
...is it cheaper?

147
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,743
You'd think, wouldn't you?

148
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,078
-Miss?
-Okay.

149
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,747
I will have the, uh...

150
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,206
...side salad.

151
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,084
And what would that be on the side of?

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,045
I don't know.

153
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,256
Why don't you just put it right here
next to my water?

154
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,051
And for you?

155
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:16,848
Um, I'm gonna have a cup
of the cucumber soup...

156
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,684
...and, urn...

157
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,853
...take care.

158
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,901
-I will have the, uh, Cajun catfish.
-Anything else?

159
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,070
Yes, how about a verse of
"Killing Me Softly"?

160
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,617
You're gonna sneeze
in my fish, aren't you?

161
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,000
Plus tip, divided by six....

162
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,212
Okay, everyone owes 28 bucks.

163
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,256
Um, everyone?

164
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,259
Oh. You're right, I'm sorry.

165
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,469
Thank you.

166
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,346
It's Monica's big night.
She shouldn't pay.

167
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,598
Aw, thank you.

168
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,475
So five of us is...

169
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,228
...33.50 apiece.

170
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,897
No. Uh-uh. No way.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

171
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,983
Whoa. Whoa. Prom night flashback.

172
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,988
Sorry, Monica.
I'm really happy you got promoted...

173
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,408
...but cold cucumber mush
for 30-something bucks?

174
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,618
No.

175
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,539
Rachel just had that little salad...

176
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,084
...and Joey with his, like, teeny pizza.

177
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,211
Okay, Pheebs.

178
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,506
How about we'll each
just pay for what we had, okay?

179
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,134
-It's no big deal.
-Not for you.

180
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,181
All right, what's going on?

181
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,518
Okay, look, I really don't wanna
get into this right now.

182
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,896
-It'll just make everybody uncomfortable.
-Oh, fine. All right, fine.

183
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,232
-What? Whoa, whoa.
-You can tell us.

184
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,277
Yeah, hello? It's us.
All right? We'll be fine.

185
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,283
Ahem. Okay, urn....

186
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,329
Uh, we three feel like that, uh, ahem...

187
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:08,209
...sometimes you guys don't get that,
uh, ahem....

188
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,968
We don't have as much money as you.

189
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,182
-Okay.
-I hear you.

190
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,935
We can talk about that.

191
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,229
Well, then...

192
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,149
...let's.

193
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:38,197
Well, um, I guess I just never think
of money as an issue.

194
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,575
-That's because you have it.
-That's a good point.

195
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,664
So, um, how come you guys
haven't talked about this before?

196
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,043
Because it's always something, you know?
Like with Monica's new job...

197
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,087
...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

198
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,214
What? Whoa, hey.

199
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,928
I don't want my birthday to be
the source of any kind of negative....

200
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,013
There's gonna be a hoopla?

201
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:09,103
Basically there's the thing,
and then the stuff after the thing and it's-

202
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,815
If it makes anybody feel better,
we can just forget the thing...

203
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,068
...and we'll just do the gift.

204
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,904
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

205
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,908
No, the thing was we were gonna go see
Hootie and the Blowfish.

206
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,870
Hootie and the- Oh, my-
I can catch them on the radio.

207
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,041
No. Now I feel bad.
You wanna go to the concert.

208
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,669
No, look, hey, it's my birthday...

209
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,047
...and the important thing
is that we all be together.

210
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,423
-All of us.
-Together.

211
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,217
Not at the concert.

212
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,221
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thanks.

213
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,639
Yeah.

214
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,940
So, the Ebola virus.
That's gotta suck, huh?

215
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,571
Gee, Monica. What's in the bag?

216
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,324
I don't know, Chandler.
Let's take a look.

217
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,451
Oh, it's like a skit.

218
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,872
Why, it's dinner for six.
Five steaks...

219
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,417
...and an eggplant for Phoebe.

220
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:18,423
We switched meat suppliers at work, and
they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.

221
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,844
But wait, there's more.
Hey, Chandler, what is in that envelope?

222
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,931
By the way, this didn't
seem so dorky out in the hall.

223
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,349
Come on.

224
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,020
Why, it's six tickets to
Hootie and the Blowfish.

225
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,649
The Blowfish.

226
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,280
It's on us, all right? So don't worry.
This is our treat.

227
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,033
So...thank you.

228
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,871
Could you be less enthused?

229
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,498
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

230
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,500
But it just feels like....

231
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,002
Like?

232
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,963
-Charity.
-Charity?

233
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,549
We're just trying to do a nice thing here.

234
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,845
But, Ross, you have to understand, your
nice thing makes us feel about this big.

235
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,015
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

236
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:14,812
What? I don't understand. I mean,
it's like we can't win with you guys.

237
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,149
If you guys feel this big,
maybe that's not our fault.

238
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,234
Maybe that's just how you feel.

239
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,403
Oh.

240
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:28,076
-Now you're telling us how we feel.
-We never should have talked about this.

241
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,994
I'm gonna pass on the concert...

242
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,539
...because I'm just not in a very
Hootie place right now.

243
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,377
-Me neither.
-Me too.

244
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,838
Guys, we bought the tickets.

245
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,592
Well, then you'll have extra seats,
you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.

246
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,388
Why did you look at me
when you said that?

247
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,352
So I guess now we can't go.

248
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,898
Come on, do what you want. Do we
always have to do everything together?

249
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,901
You know what? You're right.

250
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,028
-Fine.
-Fine.

251
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,738
-Fine.
-Fine.

252
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,408
-Fine.
-All right.

253
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,077
We're gonna go.

254
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,085
It's not for another six hours.
We're gonna go then.

255
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,553
-Chandler?
-Yeah.

256
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,346
Oh, jeez.

257
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,306
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

258
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,017
Just let me grab my jacket
and tell you I had sex today.

259
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,769
Whoa, whoa.

260
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,064
What? You had sex today?

261
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,609
Wow. It sounds even cooler
when somebody else says it.

262
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,282
I was awesome, okay? She was
biting her lip to stop from screaming.

263
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,658
Wow.

264
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:54,245
Now, I know it's been a while,
but I took that as a good sign.

265
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,085
Still doing the screening thing?

266
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,212
I had sex today.

267
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,549
I never have to answer that phone again.

268
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,927
<i>Here comes the beep. You know what to do.</i>

269
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,138
<i>Hey, Bob. It's Jade.</i>

270
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,600
<i>/ just wanted to tell you I was really hurt
when you didn't show up the other day.</i>

271
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,687
<i>And just so you know,
I ended up meeting a guy.</i>

272
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,981
Bob here.

273
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,941
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

274
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,402
So, uh, you met someone, huh?

275
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,070
<i>Yes. Yes, I did.</i>

276
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,824
<i>In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.</i>

277
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,205
So, uh, how was he?

278
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,915
Eh....

279
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,173
"Eh"?

280
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,968
<i>Oh, Bob, he was nothing
compared to you.</i>

281
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,225
<i>/ had to bite my lip to keep
from screaming your name.</i>

282
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,438
Well, that makes me feel so good.

283
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,900
<i>It was just so awkward and bumpy.</i>

284
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,652
<i>Bumpy?</i>

285
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:12,156
Maybe he had some kind of, uh,
new cool style that you're not familiar with.

286
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,575
And, uh,
maybe you have to get used to it.

287
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,911
<i>There wasn't much time to get used to it...</i>

288
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,246
<i>...if you know what I mean.</i>

289
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,093
You know what?
I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.

290
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,596
Yeah, I know. It's my birthday.
We all should be here.

291
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,807
So let's go.

292
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,691
Well, you know,
maybe we should stay for one song.

293
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,777
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them
for us to leave now.

294
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,988
You know, the guys are probably
having a great time.

295
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:56,158
<i>Every time I look at you
I go blind</i>

296
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,369
Come on, you guys.
One more time.

297
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,704
Okay.

298
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,623
-One.
-No.

299
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,755
Thank you very much.
We are Hootie & The Blowfish.

300
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,551
-That was amazing.
-Excellent.

301
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,469
I can't believe the guys missed this.

302
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,596
What guys? Oh, yeah.

303
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,934
Excuse me.
You're Monica Geller, aren't you?

304
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,770
-Do I know you?
-You used to be my baby-sitter.

305
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,940
Oh, my God. Little Stevie Fisher?

306
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,650
How have you been?

307
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,569
Good, good. I'm a lawyer now.

308
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,071
You can't be a lawyer. You're 8.

309
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,408
Well, listen, it was nice to see you.
I gotta run backstage.

310
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,743
Wait, backstage?

311
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,578
Oh, yeah. My firm represents the band.

312
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,288
-Ross.
-Chandler.

313
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,792
-Look, you guys wanna meet the group?
-Yeah, we do.

314
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,002
Come on.

315
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,505
So, look, are you one of the ones
that fooled around with my dad?

316
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,971
-Hey, you guys.
-Happy birthday.

317
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,890
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

318
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,225
So, uh....

319
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,103
How was your night last night?

320
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,857
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked.
How was yours?

321
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,776
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked too.

322
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,487
Oh, but I did run into Stevie Fisher.
Remember him?

323
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,781
Oh, yeah. I used to baby-sit him.

324
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,532
Hey, how's his dad?

325
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,994
Good.

326
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,623
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening
was pretty much a bust.

327
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,709
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

328
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,713
Yeah, look, we were just saying,
this whole thing is so stupid.

329
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:38,010
We just have to really, really
not let stuff like money, get like-

330
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,470
Is that a hickey?

331
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,432
Oh, ha, ha, no, I just....

332
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,393
I fell down.

333
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,480
On someone's lips?

334
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,441
Where'd you get the hickey?

335
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,027
-You know, a party or—
-What party?

336
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:59,824
Well, it wasn't a party so much as a-
A gathering of people.

337
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,494
With food and music and-

338
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,329
And the band.

339
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,916
You partied with
Hootie and the Blowfish?

340
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,045
Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie
are like this.

341
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,589
Who gave you that hickey?

342
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,425
That would be the work of a Blowfish.

343
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,098
I can't believe it. I can't believe this.

344
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,853
We're just sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers...

345
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,108
...and you guys are out, like,
partying and having fun and all:

346
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,444
"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck."

347
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,658
Hey, look, don't blame us.
You guys could've been there.

348
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,995
Oh, what? As part of your
Poor Friends Outreach program?

349
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,039
Oh, great. It's work.

350
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,918
Look, I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry that we make more than you.

351
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:56,255
But we're not gonna feel guilty about it.
We work really hard for it.

352
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,132
And we don't work hard?

353
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,967
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I got a page.

354
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:04,180
I'm just saying that sometimes we like
to do stuff that costs a little more.

355
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,474
-Oh, and you feel like we hold you back.
-Yes.

356
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,642
No.

357
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,565
Leon, wait. Shh! Guys.

358
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,609
Wait, I don't understand.

359
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,986
Those steaks were just a gift
from the meat vendor.

360
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,946
That was not a kickback.

361
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,784
Come on, I'll just replace them
and we can forget the whole thing.

362
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,996
What corporate policy?

363
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,045
Yeah.

364
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,755
Okay.

365
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,470
I just got fired.

366
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,978
Here's your check. That'll be 4.12.

367
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,438
Let me get that.

368
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,443
You got 5 bucks?

369
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,498
<i>Here comes the beep. You know what to do.</i>

370
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,626
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

371
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,298
<i>Listen, Bob,
I'm probably way out of line here.</i>

372
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:25,886
<i>/ mean, it has been three years, and you're
probably seeing someone else now...</i>

373
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,974
<i>...but if we could just have one night
together, just for old time's sake....</i>

374
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:34,603
<i>One hot, steamy, wild night....</i>
