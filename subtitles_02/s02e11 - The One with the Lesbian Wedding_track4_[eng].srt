1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,130
Okay, here's his diaper bag...

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,634
-...and his, uh, Mr. Winky. Ha, ha.
-Ha, ha.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,927
And, uh....

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,220
Oh.

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,429
Him. Hi!

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,766
-How did everything go?
-Great.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,143
There was a projectile, uh...

8
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,271
...throwing up incident,
but he started it.

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,482
-Ha, ha. We've gotta go.
-Okay.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,902
Oh, right. Urn....

11
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,530
I've got some news. It's about us.

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,824
-Oh, you and me?
-Uh, no. Susan and me.

13
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,701
The other "us."

14
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,703
Okay.

15
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,707
We're getting married.

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,008
As in, "I now pronounce you
wife and wife" married?

17
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,513
We'd like you to come.
We understand if you don't want to.

18
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,850
Why wouldn't I want to come?
I had fun at the first wedding.

19
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,353
I just thought that-

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:06,108
Why shouldn't I be happy for you?
What would it say about me...

21
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,319
...if I couldn't, uh, revel in your joy?

22
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,030
And I'm reveling, baby. Believe me.

23
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,741
Is your finger caught in that chair?

24
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,702
Mm-hm.

25
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,288
-Want us to go?
-Uh-huh.

26
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,213
<i>You're clearly bothered by
something. Tell me what it is.</i>

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,841
This is cool.
You're actually on television.

28
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,344
I know.
It really hit me last night.

29
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,512
I'm on <i>Days of our Lives.</i>

30
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:24,102
Then I started thinking about us,
and how these are the days of our lives.

31
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,648
-Yes!
-What?

32
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,943
Carol and Susan's caterer
had a bike accident...

33
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,279
...and she's in a full-body cast.

34
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,782
Yes!

35
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,036
They asked me, which is cool
since I've never catered...

36
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,664
...and I need the money.
Is this a problem?

37
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,999
-Would it matter?
-You're so great!

38
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,459
Thank you!

39
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,170
-You're really not going?
-I'm really not.

40
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,132
They already live together.
Why do they need to get married?

41
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,967
They love each other.

42
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,721
They wanna celebrate that love
with the people close to them.

43
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,641
If you wanna call that a reason.

44
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,020
<i>Who's the bitterest man
In the living room?</i>

45
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,190
<i>The bitterest man
In the living room?</i>

46
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,776
Hi, neighbor.

47
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:19,366
-I thought you were over this.
-That has nothing to do with it.

48
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:23,203
If she were marrying a guy,
you wouldn't expect me to go.

49
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:27,207
If she were marrying a guy,
she'd be the worst lesbian ever.

50
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,586
Did I miss it?

51
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,965
No, I'm on right after this guy
shoots himself.

52
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,259
Whoa, she's pretty.

53
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,511
And she's really nice.

54
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,639
She taught me about
how to work with the cameras...

55
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,725
...and smell-the-fart acting.

56
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,604
-I'm sorry, what?
-Excuse me?

57
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,567
You got so many lines
to learn so fast that sometimes...

58
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,695
...you need a minute
to remember your next one.

59
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,613
So while you're thinking...

60
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:02,284
...you take this big pause
where you look all intense.

61
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,535
Like this:

62
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,748
-Oh.
-Okay.

63
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,502
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!

64
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,923
<i>-Mrs. Wallace?
-Yes.</i>

65
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,634
<i>I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray,
your sister's neurosurgeon.</i>

66
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,970
<i>Is she going to be all right?</i>

67
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:26,057
<i>I'm afraid the situation
is much more dire than we'd expected.</i>

68
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,560
<i>Your sister's suffering from a...</i>

69
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,485
<i>...subcranial hematoma.</i>

70
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:42,240
<i>Perhaps we can
discuss this further over coffee.</i>

71
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,456
Nice!

72
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,628
For a minute, I thought you were
actually smelling something.

73
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,840
-Do it again!
-All right!

74
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,301
-That was so good!
-Do it again.

75
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,055
"Damn it, Braverman!
It's right there on the chart!"

76
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,644
I gotta get to work.
I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

77
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,895
No, that's me.

78
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,396
Oh, right.

79
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,108
-Oh.
-Oh.

80
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,569
Oh, thanks. Couldn't, uh....

81
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,698
Is everything okay?

82
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,869
Um, no. Uh-uh. Urn....

83
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,373
One of my clients died
on the massage table today.

84
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,999
Oh, my God.

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,545
That's a little more relaxed
than you want them to get.

86
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,754
Yeah, uh-huh.

87
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,716
Um, she was, you know,
82 years old...

88
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,262
...and her name was, urn,
Mrs. Adelman.

89
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,471
Oh, honey.

90
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,140
It's just so strange. You know...

91
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,060
...she probably woke up
this morning and thought...

92
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,981
...I'll have some breakfast,
take a walk, then have my massage.

93
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,401
Little did she know God thought,
"Okay, but that's it."

94
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,907
Oh, but the weirdest thing was...

95
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,327
...I was cleansing her aura
when it happened.

96
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,247
And when her spirit
left her body...

97
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,666
...I don't think it went very far.

98
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,751
What do you mean?

99
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,046
I think it went into me.

100
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,098
This is so hard.

101
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,392
I can't decide
between lamb or duck.

102
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,269
Well, lambs are scarier.

103
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,856
Or the movie would've been called
<i>Silence of the Ducks.</i>

104
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,026
Okay, who ordered what?

105
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:45,572
I had the half-drunk cappuccino
with the lipstick on the rim.

106
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,451
And this with the cigarette
butt in it, is that decaf?

107
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,286
Oh, God.

108
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,622
You're so uptight
about your mom coming.

109
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,125
I know. I just don't want
her to think that because...

110
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,878
...I didn't marry Barry
my life is crap.

111
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,922
Talk about crap, just
listen to Stella Neidman...

112
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,426
...tell her story about Rod Steiger
for the hundredth time.

113
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,809
Uh, Pheebs? How long do you think
this lady will be with us?

114
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,521
I don't know. She obviously
has some unfinished business.

115
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,773
Sit up!

116
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,319
There she is!

117
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,321
-Mom!
-Hey, sweetie!

118
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,163
So this is where you work!

119
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,540
Oh, it's wonderful!

120
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,753
Is it a living room?
Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

121
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,005
I guess that's the fun.

122
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,257
Pretty much.
Here, meet my friends.

123
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,344
Monica! You look gorgeous!

124
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,848
Oh, my! The last time I saw you,
it was eat or be eaten.

125
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,267
Uh, this is Joey.

126
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,560
This is Phoebe.

127
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,020
This is Chandler.

128
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,355
You remember Ross?

129
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,774
-Oh, hello, Ross.
-Hi, Mrs. Green.

130
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,446
What do you think of my
daughter, in the apron...

131
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,823
...with the big job!

132
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,449
Oh, Mom!

133
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:17,539
If you didn't pour the coffee,
no one would have anything to drink.

134
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,458
Believe me, sometimes that happens.

135
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,922
This is just so exciting!
You know, I never worked.

136
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,426
I went from my father's house
to the sorority house...

137
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,346
...to my husband's house.
I am just so proud of you!

138
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,056
Really?

139
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,559
I know who you remind me of.

140
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,310
Evelyn Durmer.

141
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,441
That's before the lousy face-lift.
Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

142
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,530
Pheebs? Ha, ha. Who's Evelyn Durmer?

143
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,242
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?

144
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,912
Oh, my God!

145
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,750
There's an unattractive
nude man playing the cello.

146
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,254
Just be glad he's not playing
a smaller instrument.

147
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,594
You have some life here, sweetie!

148
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,306
Mom, I realize you were upset
when I didn't marry Barry...

149
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:20,101
...and get the house in the suburbs
with all the security.

150
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,395
This is just
so much better for me.

151
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,566
I know.
You didn't love Barry, honey.

152
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,319
And I've never seen you this happy.

153
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,072
I look at you and I think,
"This is what I want."

154
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,868
For me.

155
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,205
Well, not just for you.

156
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,539
What do you mean?

157
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,795
I'm, uh, considering leaving your father.

158
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,050
All right, tell me
if this is too cute.

159
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,136
Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.

160
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,268
Oh, God. I think I'm gonna be sick.

161
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,980
What? It's not like I'm putting
little nipples on them.

162
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,362
-You had no idea?
-None.

163
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,072
They didn't fight?

164
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,991
No, they didn't even
talk to each other.

165
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,245
How was I suppose to know
they were having problems?

166
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,332
You know, in my day,
divorce was not an option.

167
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,418
Hey, look who's up!

168
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,882
I just can't believe this is happening.

169
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,802
When I was little,
all parents got divorced.

170
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,139
I figured as an adult,
I wouldn't have to worry about it.

171
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,267
Can't you look at this as flattering?

172
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,519
She just wants to be like you.

173
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,897
Well, couldn't she have just
copied my haircut?

174
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,110
When my parents divorced,
they sent me to a shrink...

175
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,405
...and she told me
that kids blame themselves.

176
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,324
But in your case,
it's actually kind of true.

177
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,577
Oh, that's him.

178
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,622
Damn. My mail-order
grandfather hasn't come yet.

179
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,542
-Phoebe?
-Hi, Mr. Adelman.

180
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,711
-Nice to see you.
-Thanks for coming.

181
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,548
That's okay. Although you did
cut into my busy day of sitting.

182
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,302
Um, do you wanna sit?

183
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,430
No, I spent most of my morning
trying to stand up.

184
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,809
What can I do for you, my dear?

185
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,188
Okay, I don't know how
to say this, but, um...

186
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,149
...I think when your wife's spirit
left her body...

187
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,776
...it, um, kind of stuck around...

188
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,986
...in me.

189
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,947
You're saying my wife is in you?

190
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,284
Yeah. You don't have to
believe me, but...

191
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,787
...um, can you think of
any unfinished business she had?

192
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,956
Any reason to hang around?

193
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,833
I don't know what to say.

194
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,336
All I can think of is that...

195
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,506
...she used to say that before she died,
she wanted to see everything.

196
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,176
-Everything?
-Everything.

197
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,303
Whoa. That's a lot of stuff.

198
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,638
Oh, wait, I....

199
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,808
I remember she also said she wanted
to sleep with me one last time.

200
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,987
I'm sorry.
There's laughing in my head.

201
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,950
Worth a shot, huh?

202
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,374
Ha, ha. Look at this.

203
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,543
These are all Halloween,
three years ago.

204
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,879
Oh, and look, here's Barry.

205
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,173
He came straight from the office?

206
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,884
Oh, no. That was his costume.

207
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:46,140
See, he's actually an orthodontist,
but he came as a regular dentist.

208
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,892
Um, you guys?

209
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,062
Remember when I said
that I don't need your help?

210
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,981
Actually, I think you said:

211
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,733
"Don't touch that
and get out of my kitchen."

212
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,945
Really? Weird. Anyway....

213
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,615
I planned really well.
I planned and planned.

214
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,743
I just didn't plan enough time to do it.

215
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,830
-You want some help?
-If you want.

216
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,459
-Hey.
-Hey.

217
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,961
What a day.

218
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,879
I took her everywhere.

219
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,885
The Museum of Modern Art,
Rockefeller Center...

220
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,595
...the Statue of Liberty.

221
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,097
She's still with you?

222
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,143
Yes. I guess she hasn't
seen everything yet.

223
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,105
Be right back. She has to go
to the bathroom again.

224
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,693
Such a pretty face!

225
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,783
Oh, this is so much fun.
Just the girls.

226
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,704
Do you know what we should do?
Does anybody have any marijuana?

227
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,913
God!

228
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,295
Look, no one's smoking pot
around all this food.

229
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,339
Well, that's fine.

230
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,467
I never did it. I just thought I might.

231
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,762
What's new in sex?

232
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,475
What's new in sex?

233
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,144
The only man I've been with
is your father.

234
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,230
I'm dicing. I'm dicing.
I don't hear anything.

235
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,193
This is no offense to your dad,
but I was thinking...

236
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,652
...there might be more.

237
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,239
You know what? I cannot
have this conversation with you.

238
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,449
All right.

239
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,661
You come here and drop this bomb on me
before you even tell Daddy.

240
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,499
Do you want my blessing?
Want me to talk you out of it?

241
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,125
Then what do you want?

242
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,669
I guess I figured
you would understand.

243
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,339
Why on earth
would I understand this?

244
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,259
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

245
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,387
But I married mine.

246
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,681
Oh.

247
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,772
We're in trouble. We've only got
12 hours and 36 minutes left.

248
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,690
Move, move, move!

249
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,111
I feel like you should
have German subtitles.

250
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,739
Joey, speed it up!

251
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,868
I'm sorry! It's the pigs!
They're reluctant to get in the blanket!

252
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,456
How did this happen?
I thought you had this planned out.

253
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,750
Do you want me to cry?

254
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,795
Is that what you want?

255
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,880
Do you wanna see me cry?

256
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,507
Sir, no, sir!

257
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,262
All right, you!

258
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:33,224
No. Look, I told you,
I am not a part of this thing.

259
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,812
Look, Ross. I know you have issues with
Carol and Susan, and I feel for you.

260
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,107
But if you don't help,
I'm gonna take those hot dogs...

261
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,235
...and create an appetizer
called "Pigs In Ross."

262
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,821
All right, ball a melon!

263
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,158
How come I'm stuck dicing
when he gets to ball a melon?

264
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,207
-How's it going?
-Great! Right on schedule.

265
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,667
Got my happy helpers.

266
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,880
That's fine. Whatever.

267
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:05,882
What's wrong?

268
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,091
Nothing.

269
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,388
Okay, everything.
I think we're calling off the wedding.

270
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,725
You're still gonna pay me, right?

271
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,229
Or something a little less selfish.

272
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,398
What's the matter? What happened?

273
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,526
My parents called to say
they weren't coming.

274
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,530
I knew they were
having trouble with this, but...

275
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,242
...they're my parents.
They're supposed to give me away.

276
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:38,080
Susan and I fought because
I said maybe we should call it off.

277
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,292
She said, "This isn't for them.
It's for us."

278
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,921
And if I couldn't see that,
we should cancel the wedding.

279
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,089
I don't know what to do.

280
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,970
I, uh, can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but I think Susan's right.

281
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:54,805
You do?

282
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,810
Do you love her? And don't be
too emphatic about this.

283
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,064
Of course I do.

284
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,899
Well then, that's it.

285
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,237
If George and Adelaide can't
accept that, then the hell with them.

286
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,574
If my parents didn't want me
to marry you...

287
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,743
...no way that would've stopped me.

288
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,996
Look, this is your wedding.

289
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,082
Do it.

290
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,420
You're right. Of course you're right.

291
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,005
So we're back on?

292
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,757
We're back on.

293
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,885
You heard the woman!
Peel! Chop! Devil!

294
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,265
Can't believe I lost two minutes.

295
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,610
It just seems so futile.

296
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,531
You know?
All these women, and nothing!

297
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:59,453
I feel like Superman
without my powers, you know?

298
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,958
I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.

299
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,588
Well, now you understand
how I feel every single day.

300
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,051
The world is my lesbian wedding.

301
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,564
Butterscotch?

302
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,191
No one?

303
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,111
All right, you'll be sorry later.

304
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,455
Aw.

305
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,606
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

306
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,277
Ross.

307
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,117
Nothing makes God happier...

308
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:24,080
...than when two people, any two people,
come together in love.

309
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,750
Friends, family,
we're gathered here today...

310
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,544
...to join Carol and Susan
in holy matrimony.

311
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,129
Oh, my God.

312
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,673
Now I've seen everything!

313
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,512
Whoa, she's gone.

314
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,721
She's gone.

315
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,931
She's gone.

316
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,684
Go ahead, get married. Go, go!

317
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,941
<i>Strangers in the night
Exchanging glances</i>

318
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,943
<i>Wondering in the night</i>

319
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,486
Would you look at them?

320
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,114
Yeah. Can't help but.

321
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,580
How's that pig-in-the-blanket
working out for you?

322
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,708
I wrapped those bad boys.

323
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,671
-I miss Rose.
-Oh, yeah?

324
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,717
I know it's kind of weird,
but she was a big part of my life....

325
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,678
I don't know, I feel alone.

326
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,308
You know, I, uh, couldn't help
overhearing what you just said.

327
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,605
I think it's time you forget about Rose,
move on with your life.

328
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,524
How about we get you a drink?

329
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,484
Okay. So nice!

330
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,620
I shouldn't even bother
coming up with a line, right?

331
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,250
Hey, Mom, having fun?

332
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,213
Am I! I just danced
with a wonderfully large woman.

333
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,551
And three other girls
made eyes at me over at the buffet.

334
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,345
I'm not saying
it's something I wanna pursue...

335
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,806
...but it's nice to know I have options.

336
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,811
Ahem, there's more alcohol, right?

337
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,067
How you doing?

338
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,153
Okay.

339
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,907
You did a good thing today.

340
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,871
You wanna dance?

341
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,248
No, that's fine.

342
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,209
Come on.

343
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,628
I'll let you lead.

344
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,800
Okay.

345
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,898
Look, penis, schmenis!

346
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,942
Okay? We're all people.

347
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,997
Which one of us is gonna be
the first one to get married?

348
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,124
Mon, I was married.

349
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,211
-Yeah, me too, technically.
-I had a wedding.

350
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,838
Just trying to start a discussion.

351
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:24,260
Which one do you think
will be the last to get married?

352
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,140
Isn't Ben in this?

353
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,226
-Of course!
-Absolutely.
