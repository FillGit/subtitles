1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,506
All right, no peeking. No peeking.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,549
No peeking. No peeking!

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:11,553
All right, all right, but you better be
wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,099
All right. Open your eyes!

5
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:24,149
Sweet mother of all
that is good and pure.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,110
Huh? <i>Days of our Lives
</i>picked up my option!

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,905
-Congratulations!
-I know! Ha-ha-ha.

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:34,409
Now we can watch <i>Green Acres
</i>the way it was meant to be seen.

9
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:38,205
So, uh, which one is mine?

10
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:42,251
Whichever one you want, man.
Whichever one you want!

11
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,045
Not that one.

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,218
Oh, yes!

13
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,888
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

14
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,224
Oh.

15
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,269
-Do we dare?
-We dare.

16
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,272
Oh.

17
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,316
Oh!

18
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,701
I can't believe two cows
made the ultimate sacrifice...

19
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,370
...so you could watch TV
with your feet up.

20
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,248
No, they were chair-shaped cows.

21
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,627
They never would have survived
in the wild.

22
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,919
This screen is amazing.

23
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,173
-Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
-Uh-huh.

24
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,012
Rose Marie really belongs on
a smaller screen, doesn't she?

25
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,889
-Hi, you guys.
-Hey.

26
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,349
Hey.

27
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,352
-Hey, you.
-Hey, you.

28
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,481
-Whoa, hey, whoa.
-Oh.

29
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,025
So, uh, how was your day?

30
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,693
Oh, you know, pretty much the usual.

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,780
Uh, sun shining, birds chirping.

32
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,156
Really? Mine too.

33
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,158
Hey, cool! Mine too!

34
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,289
I gotta get to the museum. So, urn....

36
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:47,167
-I'll see you tonight?
-Okay.

37
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,130
Oh.

38
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,424
Bye, guys!

39
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,675
-Bye.
-Bye.

40
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,138
-Tonight?
-Hey, whoa.

41
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,475
-What's tonight?
-It is our first official date.

42
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,268
Our first date.

43
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,480
Uh, ha, ha. Hello?

44
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,774
Hi.

45
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,195
Tonight? You're supposed to waitress
for me? My catering thing?

46
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,699
-Any of that trigger anything?
-Oh, God, Monica. I forgot!

47
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,701
This is our first date.

48
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,954
-Yes, but my mom got me this job.
-I can be a waitress!

49
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,416
Thank you, thank you.
See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

50
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,042
-Really, Pheebs?
-Uh-huh.

51
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,711
You'd have to be an actual waitress.

52
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,755
This can't be like your
"I can be a bear cub" thing.

53
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,425
I can be a waitress. Okay, watch this.

54
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,885
Um, give me two number ones,
86 the bacon...

55
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,971
...one Adam and Eve on a raft
and wreck them!

56
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,320
It's James Bond!

57
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,159
-Sorry we're late.
-That's okay. Come on in.

58
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,829
Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming?
I was told she was.

59
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,039
Dr. Burke, it's me.

60
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,583
Monica?

61
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,585
My God! You used to be so....

62
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,422
I mean, you've-
You must have lost like....

63
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,802
-You look great.
-Thank you.

64
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,763
This is Phoebe.
She'll be helping me.

65
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,681
Hi, Phoebe. Nice to meet you.

66
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,564
-So how you been?
-Great. How have you been?

67
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,983
Oh, obviously you know
Barbara and I split up...

68
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,486
...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.

69
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,987
The head tilt?

70
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,364
Since the divorce,
everybody asks how I am...

71
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,493
...with a sympathetic head tilt.
"How you doing? You okay?"

72
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,911
Oh.

73
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,454
-I'm sorry.
-No, no.

74
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,581
It's fine. Believe me, I do it too.

75
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:54,461
I always answer with the
"I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay."

76
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,672
"You're sure?" "Yeah, I'm fine."

77
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,425
I gotta set up the music.
I got a new CD changer.

78
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,762
Of course, the divorce only left me
with four CDs to change.

79
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,556
Oh, that's too bad.

80
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,850
I'll survive.

81
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,270
<i>Ward. With a reverse.</i>

82
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,607
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both.

83
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,609
But listen...

84
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,445
...don't ring the buzzer for 19.

85
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,323
Ring 20. Geller/Green.

86
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,243
They'll let you in, okay?

87
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,873
If you buzz our door,
there's no tip for you.

88
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,584
Okay, thanks.

89
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,589
Pizza's on the way.
I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

90
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,926
What if we have to pee?

91
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,348
I'll cancel the sodas.

92
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,396
Get back out there. It's your party!

93
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,732
But they're so dull.
They're all ophthalmologists.

94
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,651
You're an ophthalmologist.

95
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,113
Because my parents wanted me to be.
I wanted to be a sheriff.

96
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,368
Ha, ha. That's funny.
Cadillac, cataract. I get it.

97
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,662
But you stay out there!

98
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,540
-You see?
-All right, I tell you what.

99
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,460
I'll come get you in five minutes with
some sort of, urn, kebob emergency.

100
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,712
Okay.

101
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,131
Ah. Better.

102
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,383
Oh, God, here we go.

103
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,510
Hey, want to see them go nuts?

104
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,345
Watch this.

105
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,806
Who needs glasses?

106
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,191
-You are so smitten.
-I am not!

107
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,320
Oh, you are so much
the smitten kitten.

108
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,155
Oh.

109
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,073
-You should ask him out.
-Dr. Burke?

110
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:51,745
I don't think so.
I mean, like, he's a grown-up.

111
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,916
So? You two are totally into each other.

112
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,753
He's a friend of my parents.
He's like 20 years older than me.

113
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,172
So you're never gonna see him again?

114
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,758
Not never.

115
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,219
I'm gonna see him tomorrow
at my eye appointment.

116
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,557
-Didn't you just get your eyes checked?
-Yeah, but, you know, uh...

117
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,145
...27 is a dangerous eye age.

118
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:26,321
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.
I'm just saying it was a little...

119
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,864
...hard to follow.

120
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,283
I told you there'd be subtitles.

121
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,494
I know.

122
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,872
I just didn't want to wear
my glasses on our first date.

123
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,624
Oh.

124
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,091
Monica?

125
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,682
It would help when I'm kissing
if you didn't shout my sister's name.

126
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,017
-Honey, I'm just checking.
-Oh.

127
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,520
-Ahem. Monica?
-Mon?

128
00:07:58,687 --> 00:07:59,854
-Monica?
-Mon?

129
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,107
Monica?

130
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,845
What?

131
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,638
-What?
-I'm sorry.

132
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,933
I'm sorry. It's just, when you moved
your hands down to my butt...

133
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,812
...it was like,
"Whoa, Ross' hands are on my butt!"

134
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,230
Sorry.

135
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,774
And that's funny why?

136
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,736
Well, it's not. Uh....

137
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,155
I mean, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just nervous.

138
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,407
I mean, it's you.

139
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:53,908
-You know, it's us.
-Mm.

140
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:58,204
I mean, we're crossing that line.
It's sort of a big thing.

141
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,584
Well, I know it's big.
I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

142
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,210
Okay.

143
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,014
Okay, my hands were
nowhere near your butt.

144
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,850
I know, I know, I know!

145
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,020
I was thinking about when
they were there the last time.

146
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,981
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, look! Whoa, I promise.

147
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,193
I'm good. I won't laugh anymore.
Put your hands back there.

148
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,613
No, see, now I can't, because, uh...

149
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,531
...I'm feeling too self-conscious.

150
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,658
-Just one cheek.
-No. Ha.

151
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,827
The moment's gone.

152
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,288
-I'll back up into your hands.
-That's romantic.

153
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,539
-Touch it.
-No.

154
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,416
-Oh, come on, squeeze it.
-No!

155
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,709
<i>-Rub it?
-No.</i>

156
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,378
<i>Oh, come on!
Would you just grab my ass?</i>

157
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,890
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire...

158
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,143
...yet somehow
its expensive paint job...

159
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,647
...is protected by the Miracle Wax.

160
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,360
You've got a Cheeto on your face, man.

161
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,491
Thanks.

162
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,827
-Hey.
-Hey.

163
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,286
Ah.

164
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,082
Aren't you supposed
to be out with Rachel?

165
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,501
That was 14 hours ago.

166
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,629
-So how'd it go?
-Well....

167
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,632
Have you ever been, you know,
fooling around with a girl...

168
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,594
...and, uh, she started laughing?

169
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,765
Yeah, but, uh, it was 1982...

170
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,435
...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut
was tickling her chin.

171
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,107
-She laughed at you?
-Yeah.

172
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,860
I've been wanting this
since ninth grade typing.

173
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,487
You know,
I just want it to be perfect...

174
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,157
...and right and....

175
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,870
Why isn't that laser beam
cutting through the paint?

176
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,874
-It's the Miracle Wax!
-It certainly is a miracle.

177
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,667
-Hi, you guys.
-Hey.

178
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,502
-Hey.
-Hi.

179
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,255
Listen, I was, um, thinking about....

180
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,673
Listen, can you guys speak up?

181
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,135
It's harder for us to hear you
when you lower your voice.

182
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,472
Okay, listen.

183
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,684
I'm sorry about last night.
I really want to make it up to you.

184
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,938
No. You know,
there's no need to make it up- How?

185
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:34,068
Well, I was thinking maybe a, um-
Ahem, a romantic dinner...

186
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,155
...with, um, candles and wine.

187
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,867
And then, uh, ahem,
maybe going back to my place...

188
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,661
...for, um, dessert.

189
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,872
Hmm.

190
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,582
That sounds...

191
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,417
...perfect? Heh.

192
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,720
-What's this?
-Would you get us a couple of beers?

193
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,603
I'm going to look into your eyes now.

194
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,896
Really?

195
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,065
Yeah, that's my job.

196
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,110
All right. Look up.

197
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,571
Look down.

198
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,282
Now, open your eyes and look down.

199
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,951
That's right.

200
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,161
Look into the light.

201
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,789
Now look at me.

202
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,714
Okay.

203
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,178
Your eyes look good.
Those are good eyes.

204
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,639
Good. They feel good.

205
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,266
In my head.

206
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,062
Um, so....

207
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,649
-It was great to see you.
-You too.

208
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,235
You too.

209
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,071
Okay, um....

210
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,824
Goodbye. Ha, ha.

211
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,618
-Drops!
-What?

212
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,621
Drops. Here, they're free.

213
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,377
Thanks. Uh, so....

214
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,920
I guess I better be going.

215
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,880
Oh, okay, yeah, I'll see you later.

216
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,590
-Thanks again.
-Oh.

217
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,927
Oh.

218
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,315
We have to get you lazy boys
out of these chairs.

219
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,694
-Hey, whoa, hey, whoa.
-Oh, oh.

220
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:44,115
You should go outside and be with
the three-dimensional people.

221
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,452
No. Inside good.

222
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,872
Outside bad.

223
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,541
You guys are so pathetic.

224
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,335
Oh, <i>Xanadu!</i>

225
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,003
Oh!

226
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,299
She's one of us now.

227
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,843
-Hi, you guys.
-Hey.

228
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,678
-Hey.
-Hey.

229
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,723
We just wanted to stop by
and, uh, say good night.

230
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,767
Good night.

231
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,144
They won't even turn their heads.

232
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,564
All right, you guys.
I'm taking off my shirt.

233
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,405
No, she's lying.

234
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,286
Stop sending food to our apartment!

235
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,330
Why are you dressed up?

236
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,582
You're not the only one
who has a date.

237
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,335
-What? You have a date? Who with?
-No one.

238
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,254
-Come on, what's his name?
-Nothing.

239
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,340
Come on, tell me.

240
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,802
All right, but I'm very excited
about this, okay?

241
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,055
So promise you won't get
big-brothery and judgmental.

242
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,681
I promise. What?

243
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,142
-It's Richard Burke.
-Who's Richard Burke?

244
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,977
Is that Dr.--? Dr. Burke?

245
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,273
You have a date with Dr. Burke?
Why? Why? Why...

246
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,943
...should that bother me?

247
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,028
I love that man. He's like, uh...

248
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,739
...a brother to Dad.

249
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,491
Well, for your information...

250
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,328
...he is the brightest, most sophisticated,
sexiest man I've ever been with.

251
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,788
Dr. Burke is sexy?

252
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,039
Oh, God!

253
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,958
Absolutely!

254
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,919
Damn!

255
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,255
It's the museum again. Can I-? Oh.

256
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,925
-You know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
-When?

257
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:30,388
When I was, um, 7, I crashed my bike
right out in front of his house...

258
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,308
...and to stop me from crying,
he kissed me right here.

259
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,603
-Oh, you are so lucky!
-I know. Ha-ha-ha.

260
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:41,399
<i>Australopithecus </i>isn't supposed
to be in that display.

261
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,317
No, no.

262
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:47,905
No, <i>Homo habilis </i>was erect.
<i>Australopithecus </i>was never fully erect.

263
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,241
Well, maybe he was nervous.

264
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,709
Oh, look! I can't believe this!

265
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,088
<i>Homo habilis </i>can't use tools yet,
and they've got him with clay pots?

266
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,924
Why don't they just
give him a microwave? Heh.

267
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,136
I'm sorry this is taking so long.

268
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,681
You know, I— It's longer than I expected.
We will have dinner.

269
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,392
-That's okay. It's fine.
-Karl!

270
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,313
Oh, God.

271
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,703
-Wow! Is that Michelle?
-Yep.

272
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,539
I've not seen her since
high-school graduation.

273
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,751
Oh, my God, that night she got so dm-

274
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,505
Emotional.

275
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,216
-You know, she's having another baby.
-Mm.

276
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,428
-I thought she just had one.
-No, no. Henry's almost 2.

277
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,640
And he's talking and everything. Here.

278
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,891
Aw.

279
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,728
The other day he told me he liked me
better than his other grandpa.

280
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:04,273
In all fairness,
his other grandpa's a drunk, but still....

281
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,153
Whoa. You're a grandpa.

282
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,324
Yeah.

283
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,122
Are we nuts here?

284
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,375
I don't know. Maybe.

285
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:27,421
I mean, I'm dating a man
whose pool I once peed in.

286
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,174
I didn't need to know that.

287
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,469
I guess 21 years is a lot.

288
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,683
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person
who can drink older than you.

289
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,602
Yeah.

290
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,606
So....

291
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,488
-So maybe we should just....
-Yeah.

292
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,407
Yeah.

293
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,409
Maybe....

294
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,372
Wow.

295
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,001
This really sucks.

296
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,378
Yeah, it sure does.

297
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,173
Ah.

298
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,524
Uh, we don't really have to decide
anything right now, do we?

299
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,485
No, there's no rush or anything.

300
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,032
-Pizza delivery!
-Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!

301
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,369
-Rach?
-Oh.

302
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,996
-I'm done. Ah.
-Ahem.

303
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:45,875
Yeah, well, you know what?
So is, uh, Sorentino's.

304
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,545
I'm sorry. Let's, uh-
Why don't we find someplace else?

305
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:53,174
It's late. Everything will be closed.
We'll do it another night.

306
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,717
No, no, we won't.

307
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,177
We won't?

308
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,429
Come on.

309
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,598
Okay, that's dead, right?

310
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,685
-What is this? What are we doing?
-Shh.

311
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,272
-Do you want Cran-Apple or Cran-Grape?
-Grape.

312
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,068
Okay, now...

313
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,903
...sit.

314
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,697
Okay.

315
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,910
Oh, my God!

316
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,914
<i>Billions of years ago,
Earth was-</i>

317
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,209
Sorry.

318
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,091
Ah. So, what are we looking at?

319
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:40,137
Well, uh, you see that little cluster
of stars next to the big one?

320
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,057
That is Ursa Major.

321
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,602
-Really?
-No idea. It could be. Could be.

322
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,149
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

323
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,443
Oh, that's okay.

324
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,154
-You were worth the wait.
-Oh.

325
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,282
And I don't just mean tonight.

326
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:06,831
<i>I never dreamed
That I'd meet somebody like you</i>

327
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,582
Whoa.

328
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,709
You're not laughing.

329
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,004
This time it's not so funny.

330
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:24,598
<i>No, I don't want to fall in love</i>

331
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,601
<i>This love is only gonna break your heart</i>

332
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,771
-Aah!
-Oh!

333
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,149
Okay, loosen the knot.
Loosen the knot.

334
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,067
Sorry, sorry.

335
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,453
<i>What a wicked game you play</i>

336
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,540
Aah! Oh, God! Oh.

337
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,208
Honey?

338
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,169
Oh, that's okay.

339
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,045
What?

340
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,674
Oh, no. You just rolled
over the juice box.

341
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,809
Oh, thank God!

342
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,521
<i>No, I don't want to fall in love</i>

343
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:20,654
<i>No, I don't want to fall in love</i>

344
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,033
<i>This love is only gonna break your heart</i>

345
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,130
Hey.

346
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,341
Hey, you.

347
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,058
I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.

348
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,685
I know. It is pretty unbel-

349
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,273
-What?
-We're not alone.

350
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,095
-Is that the fire alarm?
-Yeah.

351
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,393
Oh, it's not warm yet.
We still have time.

352
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,980
-Cool.
<i>-Yeah, yeah. Cool!</i>
