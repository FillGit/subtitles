1
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,342
Hey.

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,845
-What you guys doing?
-Monica's making us watch <i>Old Yeller.</i>

3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,643
Why are you guys upset?
It's <i>Old Yeller. </i>It's a happy movie.

4
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,312
-What?
-What are you talking about?

5
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,773
Come on. Happy family gets a dog.

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,566
Frontier fun!

7
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,278
Pheebs, what about the end?

8
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,615
Oh, when Yeller saves the family
from the wolf and everyone's happy?

9
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,991
That's not the end.

10
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:37,079
Yeah-huh. that's when my mother would
shut off the TV and say, "The end."

11
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,582
What about when he has rabies?

12
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,126
He doesn't have rabies.
He has babies.

13
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,755
That's what my mom said.

14
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,551
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think she'd want you
to see what's about to happen.

15
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,179
Why? What's about to happen?

16
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,181
I've never seen this part.

17
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,393
Hey, Travis, what you doing
with that gun?

18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,146
Oh, no.

19
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,607
No, no, Travis, put down the gun.

20
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,568
No, no, he's your buddy.
He's your Yeller.

21
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,237
No! The end! The end!

22
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,994
Okay, what kind of a sick
doggy snuff film is this?

23
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,506
Have you guys eaten? Uh, Richard and I
just finished, and we've got leftovers.

24
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,800
Chicken and potatoes.

25
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,720
What am I wearing?

26
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,848
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

27
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,399
One of these times, you'll really
be naked and we won't come over.

28
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,277
I got a leg, three breasts
and a wing.

29
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,405
How do you find clothes that fit?

30
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,742
Oh, hey, Monica? We got a question.

31
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,329
All right, yes, I see other women
in the shower at the gym.

32
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,997
And no, I don't look.

33
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,208
No, not that one.

34
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,336
We're figuring out who to bring
to the Knicks game.

35
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,798
Ross can't go, so it's between my friend
Eric Prower, who has breath issues...

36
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,552
...and Dan, with the poking.
"Did you see that play?"

37
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,889
"You want more beer?
Is that Spike Lee?"

38
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,266
Ha, ha, okay.

39
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,977
Why don't you ask Richard?

40
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,148
Uh, Richard, if you had an extra
ticket to the Knicks game...

41
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,113
...and you had to choose between
a friend who smelled...

42
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:20,033
...and one who bruises you,
who would you pick?

43
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,493
Wow.

44
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,495
Being a huge Knicks fan myself...

45
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:27,749
...I think you should take someone
who's a huge Knicks fan.

46
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,668
Okay.

47
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,420
That's Eric.

48
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,840
Glad to be of help. Matches.

49
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,552
I meant, why don't you
take Richard to the game?

50
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,303
Eh.

51
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,888
What?

52
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,891
-I don't know.
-Come on!

53
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:49,563
He keeps his fingers to himself,
and he's always minty fresh.

54
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,316
Richard's really nice.
Uh, we just don't know him really well.

55
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,235
Plus, he's old-

56
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,990
-er than some people.

57
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,076
But, uh, younger than some buildings.

58
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,706
So what, he's a little older.
Big deal.

59
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,499
He's important to me.

60
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,627
If you ask him,
he might take you in his Jag.

61
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,592
How do we say yes...

62
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,595
...and make it seem like it's not
just to ride in the cool car?

63
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,265
Okay, this could be tough.

64
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,226
Okay, okay, okay. Monica?

65
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,897
We'll bring him,
but only if he takes the Jaguar.

66
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,276
Ooh, you almost had it.

67
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,868
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

68
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,995
-Hello, ha, ha.
-Hey.

69
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,830
Hi, honey. Oh.

70
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,500
You are not gonna believe
what happened!

71
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,878
We were playing on the floor,
and he grabs the table...

72
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,088
...and he pulls himself up!

73
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,675
He pulled himself up!

74
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,385
Standing man!

75
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:07,265
I'm sorry you missed it,
but I did tape it if you wanna see it.

76
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,393
Uh, we know.
He already did it last week.

77
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,729
You can watch our tape if you want.

78
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:17,317
Ah, see, I don't believe this.
I missed the first time of everything.

79
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,737
The first time he rolled over,
the first time he crawled.

80
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,281
What else? Has he spoken?
Is he driving?

81
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,159
Does he have a favorite liqueur?

82
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,828
He is getting closer
on the talking thing.

83
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,374
He can't quite say "mama" yet,
but once he said "Yemen."

84
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,378
See, I don't know.
I'm so sick of missing stuff.

85
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:40,173
I want him for more than a day.
I want him for a whole weekend.

86
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,424
Listen. I feel-

87
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,009
That would be great.

88
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,682
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

89
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,976
Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.

90
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,397
Oh, look, did you just see that?

91
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,191
Did you see? He just waved!
He just waved!

92
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,694
He's never waved before!

93
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,154
Yes, he has. Very good.

94
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,326
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs. What you got there?

95
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:12,455
<i>Love Story, Brian's Song </i>and
<i>Terms of Endearment.</i>

96
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,333
Wow, all you need now
is <i>The Killing Fields...</i>

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,128
...and some guacamole,
and you got yourself a party!

98
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,465
I talked to my grandma
about the <i>Old Yeller </i>incident...

99
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,469
...and she said my mom used to not
show us the ends of sad movies...

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,389
...to shield us from
the pain and sadness.

101
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,183
You know, before she killed herself.

102
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,854
-Hey.
-Hey.

103
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,231
Where's Richard?
Did you ditch him?

104
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,484
After we stole his lunch money
and gave him a wedgie.

105
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,280
What's the matter with you?
He's parking the car.

106
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,993
-Did you guys have fun?
-Your boyfriend is so cool.

107
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,205
He let us drive his Jaguar.
Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.

108
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,916
Wow.

109
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,584
He must like you best.

110
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,588
Oh, what about when he tipped the guy
who showed us to our seats?

111
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,715
You never even saw the money.

112
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,676
Hey, Chandler, thanks for
showing us to our seats.

113
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,805
Ha, ha, you're welcome.
Hey, Joey, thanks for parking the car.

114
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,682
No problem, ha, ha.

115
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,186
-Hey, Chandler-
-I think they get it.

116
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,023
There's the man!

117
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,983
Hey.

118
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,902
-Hey, you're getting better.
-Huh? Ha, ha.

119
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,112
I'm gonna keep this.

120
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,073
Okay.

121
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,324
He kept my dollar.

122
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,166
Your first weekend without Ben.
What are you doing?

123
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,293
Ah, we're going to
colonial Williamsburg.

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,964
A woman I went to college with is
the first female blacksmith there.

125
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,385
They're a little behind the times
in colonial Williamsburg.

126
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,097
Ha, ha. Well, look, I better go
before Mommy starts weeping.

127
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,266
-We love you.
-Bye, Mommy.

128
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,310
Have a good time.

129
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,437
Okay, Ben.

130
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,689
-Ross.
-Yeah?

131
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,940
Look.

132
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,658
Joey, do you know
we can see you from here?

133
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,787
How come Richard looks cooler
with one of these?

134
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,915
You may wanna light it
and lose the spatula.

135
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,712
It's cute, you trying
to be more like Richard.

136
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,672
Not like him, per se.

137
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,049
Just not unlike him.

138
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,812
It's the artist formerly known
as Chandler.

139
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,233
I'm just trying something here,
you know?

140
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,152
Why didn't you grow a mustache?

141
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,528
Oh, we flipped for it.

142
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,572
I got the cigar,
he got the mustache.

143
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,867
If we both grew them,
we'd look like dorks.

144
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,204
You really sidestepped
that land mine.

145
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,541
I promised Richard
we'd meet downstairs.

146
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,792
You're meeting Richard?

147
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,669
-Ranger game.
-Didn't he tell you?

148
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,214
He said he was going out with the guys.
I didn't know that was you.

149
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,591
You hear that?

150
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,761
-We're the guys!
-We're the guys!

151
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,513
With that mustache,
he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.

152
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,015
Thank you!

153
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,568
-Hi, we're visiting.
-Yay.

154
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,780
It's Ben and his dada.

155
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,115
Dada.

156
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,993
-Can you say "dada"?
-Aw.

157
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,288
I'm telling your mommies you said it,
so you might as well.

158
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,082
-No luck, huh?
-No.

159
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,542
A while ago,
I got a "sen" out of him...

160
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:49,672
...which I thought might turn into
"seh-condary caregiver," but....

161
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,386
Would you, uh, hold him for a sec?
I gotta take this off.

162
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,473
-Oh, yeah, sure, okay.
-There we go.

163
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,522
What are you doing?

164
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,649
I'm holding Ben.

165
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,569
Yeah, well, he's a baby, not a bomb.

166
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,613
Okay.

167
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,573
Hold him like you'd hold a football.

168
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,618
This is how I would hold a football.

169
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,037
Here. Here. There we go.

170
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:25,583
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.
I haven't been around them.

171
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,919
-I mean, you know, since I was one.
-Ha, ha.

172
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,964
-It's all right. No big deal.
-Really?

173
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,050
You'll feel different
when it's our baby.

174
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,969
-What?
-What?

175
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,680
You think about stuff like that?

176
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,599
Uh, yeah. I mean....

177
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,187
Actually, I kind of think
that we'll have two babies.

178
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,983
Two babies?

179
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,235
You know, a boy and a girl.

180
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,822
Hopefully, the girl will come first,
so Ben won't feel competitive.

181
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,410
Then what's gonna happen?

182
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,664
We won't wanna raise kids in the city,
so we'll move to Scarsdale.

183
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,416
Scar-- Uh-huh.

184
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:10,044
We'll be far enough from our parents
so we don't have to see them...

185
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,672
...but close enough
that they can babysit.

186
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,093
And yes, I know the taxes are
a little higher than Nassau County...

187
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,345
...but the school system's great.

188
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,056
Wow! Ha, ha.

189
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,893
Wow, that's great! Great!

190
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,729
-Okay, wow! You know what?
-Hmm?

191
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,607
I'm off my break now. So, uh....

192
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,734
Um, here. You take this.

193
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,903
And, urn....

194
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,156
I'm gonna go pour these
very nice people some coffee.

195
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,449
Okay.

196
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,659
Look at that. I don't have a pot.

197
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,287
I don't have a pot.
Maybe I've got one at home.

198
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,873
Or in Scarsdale.
Hey, is that a door?

199
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,625
Rach.

200
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,089
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

201
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:59,552
Oh, okay, murder, cancer, soccer teams
eating each other in the Andes.

202
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,264
-You watched the movies?
-Uh-huh.

203
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,100
What is happening to the world?

204
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,479
I mean....
No, no, because E.T. leaves...

205
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,357
...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

206
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,067
Charlotte who?

207
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,610
With the web. The spider.

208
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,987
She dies. She has babies and dies.

209
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,282
It's like, "Welcome home
from the hospital." Thud!

210
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,035
You wanna feel better?

211
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,621
-Yeah.
-Okay.

212
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,874
Here. Watch this.

213
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,710
<i>It's a Wonderful Life.
</i>Yes, I've heard of this.

214
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,505
So you can't lose.
It's there in the title.

215
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,423
Wonderfulness is baked right in.

216
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,093
I fell for that with
<i>Pride of the Yankees.</i>

217
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,387
I thought I'd see a film
about Yankee pride.

218
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,723
And boom! The guy gets
Lou Gehrig's disease.

219
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:51,729
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig.
Didn't you kind of see it coming?

220
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,359
Watch that. It'll restore
all your faith in humanity.

221
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,237
Hey, big guy. Game time.

222
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,282
-Hey! Be right there!
-There's a game?

223
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,618
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks
back from the shop.

224
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,746
Bring your nerves of steel.

225
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,042
It's the basketball playoffs.

226
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,755
Um, I appreciate this, but you don't
have to hang out with them for me.

227
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,465
They have each other.

228
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,843
Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.

229
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,972
I like hanging out with them.
They're different than my other friends.

230
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,226
They don't start sentences with "You
know who just died shoveling snow?"

231
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,646
All right, that's great.
Then just go.

232
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,481
Go Knicks!

233
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,942
-Uh, it's the college playoffs.
-Oh.

234
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,528
-Then, go Vassar!
-Uh, they're not in it.

235
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,573
-Okay, then just go.
-Okay.

236
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,659
Ugh, why does this bother me
so much?

237
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:51,706
I'm not one of those people who wants
to spend 24 hours a day together.

238
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,166
Sure.

239
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,502
He just doesn't have much free time.
What do I do?

240
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,631
Does it matter? You'll just die
or divorce or blow your pet's head off.

241
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,720
-Ugh!
-Me too!

242
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,348
Rachel, I got a question. Richard
made plans again with the guys-

243
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,476
Ross made plans for the century.

244
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:15,646
I'm gonna go read <i>Cosmo.
</i>Maybe there's something helpful in it.

245
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:20,610
If not, I can learn how to do a bikini
wax with leftover Christmas candles.

246
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,529
Okay.

247
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,531
What happened back there?

248
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,533
I don't know. You tell me.

249
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,495
One minute I'm holding Ben,
then I've got two kids...

250
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,664
...I'm living in Scarsdale
complaining about taxes!

251
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,501
Well, I'm sorry.
I think about stuff.

252
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,546
You're at work, you're assembling bones,
your mind wanders.

253
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,384
You've planned out the next 20 years.
We've dated for six weeks!

254
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,469
You never think about our future?

255
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,764
I think about whose apartment
we'll sleep at tomorrow...

256
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,100
...and where we'll have dinner
next Saturday!

257
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,852
I do not think about
our children's names!

258
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,815
You know what our
children's names will be?

259
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,483
Ha, ha, no.

260
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,278
No, I mean, you know. I read a book,
and there was a girl named Emily.

261
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,697
And I thought that might be good.

262
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,575
What was the book?

263
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,703
<i>The Big Book of Children's Names.</i>

264
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,164
Okay. Ross, Ross.

265
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,499
Okay, listen.

266
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,167
What we have is amazing.

267
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,254
But I do not want
everything decided for me!

268
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,047
I spent my whole life like that.

269
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,925
It's what I had with Barry.
That's a reason I left.

270
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,094
I like not knowing right now.

271
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,306
Sorry if that scares you, but if you
wanna be with me, deal with that!

272
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,267
-Okay, fine!
-Thank you!

273
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,811
-We're not done!
-I didn't know that.

274
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:41,357
You're with a guy who won't stop
planning his future with you.

275
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,401
He knows we'll end up together.

276
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,821
If that scares you, tough!
You'll have to deal with that.

277
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,990
-I will!
-Good, because I love you!

278
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,741
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

279
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,161
-That's the first time we've said that!
-Yes.

280
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,830
-I'm gonna kiss you!
-You better!

281
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,588
-Hey.
-Hey.

282
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,339
Oh, thanks for the great movie tip.

283
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,425
-Did you like it?
-Oh, yeah.

284
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:11,179
I don't know if I was happier when
George Bailey destroyed the business...

285
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,266
...or, um, Donna Reed cried or when
the pharmacist made his ear bleed.

286
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,979
I'll give you the ear thing,
but wasn't the ending wonderful?

287
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,315
I didn't watch it.
I was too depressed.

288
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,817
It kept getting worse!
It should've been called:

289
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:29,363
"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You
Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"

290
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,534
Kick, save! And...

291
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,036
...denied!

292
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,707
He gets it back.
Pass to the middle, lines it up and bam!

293
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:40,958
Yes!

294
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,295
Could that shot be any prettier?

295
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,505
Man, you are incredible.

296
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,466
We had a table in college.

297
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,968
Oh, really? I didn't know they had
foosball in the 1800s.

298
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,848
Nice mustache. At puberty,
that thing will really kick in.

299
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,482
Not to sound too Florence Henderson,
but dinner's on the table.

300
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,816
One more point.

301
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,071
Score!

302
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,199
-Now can we go?
-Uh-

303
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,910
That's why we don't let her play.

304
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,957
-Is everything all right?
-Mm-hm.

305
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,208
Uh-oh.

306
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,710
Oh, hey, don't be mad at him.
It's our fault.

307
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,879
I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.

308
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,215
He's just really great
to hang out with.

309
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,633
-Well....
-No, seriously.

310
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,345
We just talked about this.
He is so much cooler than our dads.

311
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,517
Our dads are okay and all,
but Richard is just-

312
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,894
Ow, ow, ow.
What are you kicking me for?

313
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,982
Huh? I'm trying to talk here.

314
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,361
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?

315
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,321
-Oh, yeah.
-No!

316
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,699
No.

317
00:17:56,117 --> 00:18:00,246
You're just clearly not familiar
with our young persons' vernacular.

318
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,833
When we say "dad," we mean "buddy."

319
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,544
-We mean "pal."
-Uh-huh, yeah.

320
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,338
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

321
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,093
Monica's my dad.

322
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,346
I've even got some dads down at work.

323
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:18,806
That's fine.

324
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:23,311
Well, your other dad and I are gonna
go have a romantic evening.

325
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,604
I'll just see you kids around.

326
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,148
Nighty-night.

327
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,234
-You're not a dad!
-You're not a dad!

328
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,653
I can't believe you got us
into trouble.

329
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,744
So are you okay?

330
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,912
Yeah.

331
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,205
Just...

332
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,833
...I feel like I'm about a hundred.

333
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,170
I thought I was just one of the guys.

334
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,963
Come here.

335
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,050
I'll make you feel like
one of the guys.

336
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,764
Mm.

337
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,933
For a really cool guy,
you suck at foosball.

338
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,853
I was killing them.

339
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,272
-Yeah, well they suck too.
-Ha, ha.

340
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,858
Hmm.

341
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,029
You take the poopy diaper
and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

342
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,367
Calling it a "poopy diaper"
doesn't make this process any cuter.

343
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,163
-Hello.
-<i>It's us.</i>

344
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,414
Come on up.

345
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,208
I'll get his stuff together.

346
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,419
Okay, we can do this now,
can't we, Ben?

347
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,421
Yes, we can.

348
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,923
Yes, we can.

349
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,885
There! I did it!

350
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,887
Ha, ha, I did it!

351
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,598
Ooh, look at that!

352
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,810
Oh, it stays on and everything.

353
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,728
-Hi.
-Hi.

354
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,487
I'm sorry. What did you just say?
Did you just say "hi"?

355
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,532
Oh, my God! Ross?
Ben just said hi!

356
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,075
-What?
-Ben just said hi!

357
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,785
What, the word "hi"?

358
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,787
No, my Uncle Hi.

359
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,749
Great! And I missed that too.
I miss everything!

360
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,044
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just
bring it out in him.

361
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,881
-Where is he?
-We missed you.

362
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,635
We missed you so much!
Come here, Ben, ha, ha.

363
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,304
Guess what?
Ben just said his first word.

364
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,348
What did he say?

365
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,058
Something about hi.

366
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,604
-That's so exciting!
-Mommy's so proud of you!

367
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,023
Hi. Hi?

368
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,317
You know, actually,
it's more like, hi!

369
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,903
-Hi?
-Hi.

370
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,155
-Hi.
-Hi.

371
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,781
-Hi.
-Hi.

372
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,700
This could go on for a while.

373
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,869
You're right.
We've got a cab waiting.

374
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,871
Well, this was fun.

375
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,999
We should do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say?

376
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,250
Okay.

377
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,086
-All right, so I've got him...?
-Tuesday.

378
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,421
Bye, you guys.

379
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,298
-Take care.
-Bye, Ben.

380
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,383
Bye.

381
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,762
Did he just say "bye"?

382
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,097
He said bye!

383
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,308
You said- He said bye to me!

384
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,435
-Yes, he did!
-Oh.

385
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,271
Suddenly I'm seeing him
go off to college!

386
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,317
We've gotta go.
We've got that cab downstairs.

387
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,569
See you later.

388
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,029
-Bye.
-Bye.

389
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,322
-Oh!
-Ha, ha.

390
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,991
-Bye.
-Bye.

391
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,493
-Bye.
-Bye.

392
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,536
Bye.

393
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,079
Oh.

394
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,299
<i>Wow. Look at this nice deep hole I dug.
Hey, Bert...</i>

395
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,092
<i>...isn't this a nice hole here?</i>

396
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,344
Okay, ahem.

397
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:48,057
Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries
Bert in the sand and can't find him.

398
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:53,771
Now, I've looked ahead on the tape,
and he does find him again.

399
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,526
But before that happens,
there's some rough going for a while.

400
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,819
But I think we can handle it.

401
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,200
And there's just the alphabet,
but we know that ends well, so....

402
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,743
Here we go.

403
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,328
<i>Bert? Bert?</i>

404
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,205
<i>Bert?</i>

405
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:15,000
<i>What happened to my friend Bert?
He was here just a moment ago.</i>

406
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,294
<i>Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.</i>

407
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,547
-Mm.
-I'm so glad you're here.
