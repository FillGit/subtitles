1
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:07,382
Joey, would you slow down?

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,260
They're not gonna be sold out of papers
at 1:00 in the morning.

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,055
I'm excited.
I've never gotten reviewed before.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,808
You were so amazing as the king.
I'm really impressed. I was.

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,310
But you know what?

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,021
You might wanna consider
wearing underwear next time.

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,942
Because when you sat on your throne,
you could kind of see your...

8
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,777
...royal subjects.

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,696
Here it is. Here it is.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,867
"The only thing worse than
the mindless adolescent direction...

11
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:38,872
...was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly
unskilled portrayal of the king."

12
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,583
Okay, look.
That is one guy's opinion.

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,461
-All right? Pheebs, read yours.
-Okay.

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,298
"The only thing worse than the mindless,
adolescent direction-"

15
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,550
Does anybody have one
from a different paper?

16
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,303
Ross, read yours.

17
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,347
I don't want to.

18
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,352
Joey, honey, they don't know
what they're talking about.

19
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:01,853
Maybe they do.

20
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,065
I've been doing this 10 years
and I haven't gotten anywhere.

21
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,275
There's gotta be a reason.

22
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,735
Come on, man, you're just, uh,
paying your dues.

23
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,113
No, no, no. It's too hard.

24
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,240
It's not worth it. I quit.

25
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,700
-What?
-That's crazy.

26
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,286
Wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute.

27
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,247
I believe this will change your mind.

28
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:25,711
"In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani was
able to achieve brilliant new levels of-"

29
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,546
Continued on page 153.

30
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,548
"-sucking."

31
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,431
When I was little,
I wanted to be a veterinarian.

32
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,018
But then I found out you have to
put your hands into cows and stuff.

33
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,646
Hi.

34
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,399
Are you okay?

35
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,277
Yeah, just a tough day at work,
you know?

36
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,780
Stegosaurus fell over, trapped a kid.

37
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,452
I know this jacket.
This is Fun Bobby's jacket.

38
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,788
Where is he? What? He's here, isn't he?

39
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,790
-Maybe.
-Don't toy with me.

40
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,959
-Geller!
-Hey, Fun Bobby.

41
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,045
Whoa, hey. You been working out?

42
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,296
Not at all.

43
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,006
I love this guy.

44
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,843
I was so psyched to hear
you're back with my sister.

45
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,179
-You and me both.
-So, what'd I miss? Come on.

46
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,723
Oh. We were trying
to make Joey feel better.

47
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,727
-Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
-No, I'm all right, man, really.

48
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,312
No, I'm picking you up.

49
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,815
Hey, no, seriously.
I don't need you to-

50
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,820
-All right, it still works.
-Okay.

51
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,365
Now, before I go, does anybody else
need to be picked up?

52
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,991
I'm still gonna go.

53
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,578
-Okay, I'll see you later, babe.
-Ah.

54
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,166
Public display of affection coming up.
You can avert your eyes.

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,085
Mm.

56
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,384
-See you.
-Bye.

57
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,594
Fun Bobby is so great.

58
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,929
Oh, isn't he?

59
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:45,851
I really think this time it may work with him.
I mean, he makes me feel so good.

60
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,396
And I've been feeling so lousy,
you know, no job, no boyfriend.

61
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,857
Well, at least my cup is half full.

62
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,693
Half full of love.

63
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,949
And for our two-week anniversary,
he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin.

64
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,118
Cabin of love.

65
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,581
We went through a lot of wine tonight,
you guys.

66
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,292
-Really? I only had two glasses.
-I just had a glass.

67
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,461
-Two.
-I had one glass.

68
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,212
I had about a mug full in this lovely...

69
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,382
..."I got boned at the Museum
of Natural History" mug.

70
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,803
Okay, so that's, what? Two bottles.

71
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,473
And yet somehow we went through five?

72
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,314
Whoa.

73
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,775
Oh.

74
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,863
So what? So he drank a lot tonight.

75
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,990
Yeah, but, you know,
now that I think about it...

76
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:46,328
...I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby
without a drink in his hand.

77
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,622
Yeah. Ooh, ooh, yeah, you know?

78
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,750
Did you notice how he always
starts his stories with, urn:

79
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,295
"Okay, I was so wasted," or,
"Oh, we were so bombed."

80
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,841
Or, um, "So I wake up and I'm
in this Dumpster in Connecticut."

81
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,763
Monica, have you ever been with him
when he wasn't drinking?

82
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,683
Well, we just happen to go to
a lot of places where you might drink.

83
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,103
I mean, how do you go to a wine-tasting
without having a drink?

84
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,940
Or to a club, or to the...

85
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,441
...zoo.

86
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,823
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?

87
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,326
Um, I don't know, why don't you taste it?

88
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,996
Mm. No.

89
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,123
Oh, well, too late, you already had some.

90
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,839
What do you say we make these, uh,
coffees Irish?

91
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,593
Um, cake.

92
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,556
Yeah, we're gonna-
We're gonna get some cake.

93
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:54,145
You know, it seems like you've been
making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.

94
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:58,733
I would make them Belgian, but the waffles
are hard to get into that flask.

95
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,652
Bobby.

96
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,861
Yeah, okay.

97
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,991
Look, maybe this is none of my business,
or maybe it is, I don't know.

98
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,035
But, um, I'm kind of worried about you.

99
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,707
Okay, look, this isn't the first time
somebody said something to me about this.

100
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:18,378
But, I don't know, I always made excuses,
like "I'm just a social drinker."

101
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,089
Or "Hey, come on, it's Flag Day."

102
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,010
So, what are you saying now?

103
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,388
I guess I'm saying...

104
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,015
...I'll try and quit.

105
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,392
I kind of like that you worry about me.

106
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,023
So, what's going on?

107
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,567
I am gonna try and quit drinking.

108
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,360
Oh. Why?

109
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,198
-Hey.
-Hey.

110
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,117
-Hey.
-Hey.

111
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,952
Guess who's back in show business.

112
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,288
Ooh, ooh. Lome Greene?

113
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,168
No, Pheebs. You know why?
Because he's dead.

114
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,628
Oh, no.

115
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,049
Okay, I guess this is gonna seem
bittersweet now...

116
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,842
...but Joey, that's who.

117
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,510
-Oh, yay!
-Really?

118
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,639
My agent just called me with an audition
for <i>Days of our Lives.</i>

119
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,183
Kick ass.

120
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:17,062
We have to celebrate.
We should do a soap opera theme.

121
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,732
Hey, yeah. We could all sleep together,
and then one of us could get amnesia.

122
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,656
Rach, what time do you get off?
We're all gonna do something tonight.

123
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:32,243
Uh, well, actually, I'm already done.
Ahem. But I kind of got plans.

124
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,913
You have other friends?

125
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,917
Yeah, I, uh- I have a date.

126
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,127
-What?
-With a man?

127
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,756
What? What is so strange
about me having a date?

128
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,174
What about Ross?

129
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,885
Are you still mad at him
because he made that list about-?

130
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,513
No, no, I'm not mad at him.

131
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,307
I'm not really anything at him anymore.

132
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,976
-What are you talking about?
-I don't know.

133
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,273
Whatever I was feeling, I'm...not.

134
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,109
But you guys came so close.

135
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,404
Oh, I know. I'm sorry, you guys.
You're gonna have to get used to the fact...

136
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,698
...that I will not be dating Ross.

137
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,119
Here he is. Hi.

138
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,621
Guys, this is Russ.

139
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,581
Hi.

140
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,972
No, no, no. I'm not saying
you're not talented. You're very talented.

141
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,518
It's just that with the bird dead and all,
there's very little act left.

142
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,564
Oh, honey, give me a break, will you?
Oh, oh. I'll talk to you later.

143
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,649
Well, there's my favorite client.

144
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,444
So tell me, darling,
how was the audition?

145
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,656
Well, I think it went pretty well.
I got a callback for Thursday.

146
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,951
Joey. Have you ever seen me ecstatic?

147
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,663
-No.
-Well, here it is.

148
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,129
Okay. Uh, listen, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

149
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,674
-The network casting lady-
-Oh, isn't Lori a doll?

150
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,926
Yeah, yeah, she's great.

151
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:16,973
But I kind of got the feeling
that she was sort of coming on to me.

152
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,561
And I definitely would get the part
if I were to, you know....

153
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,610
-If I would have sent the little general in.
-Oh.

154
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,616
I see. Well, I'm just gonna
put in a call here...

155
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,660
...and we'll find out what's going on
and straighten it out.

156
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,955
Yeah, hi. Lori, please.

157
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,876
Hi, darling.

158
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,129
So how about Joey Tribbiani
for the part of the cab driver?

159
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,090
Isn't he terrific?

160
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,925
Uh-huh.

161
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,177
Uh-huh.

162
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,888
Okay, doll, talk to you later.

163
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,182
Yeah, you're gonna have to
sleep with her.

164
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,104
-What's the matter?
-Fun Bobby.

165
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,648
What? Isn't he sober?

166
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,274
Oh, he's sober all right.

167
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,236
Just turns out that Fun Bobby
was fun for a reason.

168
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,156
Ah. Okay.

169
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,451
All right, here you go, sweetie.

170
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,830
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?

171
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,665
Oh, God, yes.

172
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,671
There are no hardware stores open
past midnight in the Village.

173
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,300
That is funny.

174
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,637
I needed to buy a hammer
the other night...

175
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,181
...and I'm out walking
around the neighborhood.

176
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,808
But apparently...

177
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:46,771
...there are no hardware stores open
past midnight in the Village.

178
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,112
Uh, say, honey, don't you have to
be at your interview?

179
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,780
Oh, yeah.

180
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,785
-See you guys.
-Bye...

181
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,705
...ridiculously dull Bobby.

182
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,042
-Oh, my God.
-He's not that bad.

183
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:12,213
Not that bad?
Did you not hear the hammer story?

184
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,591
Okay, okay, don't get all squinky.

185
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,095
Maybe it was just the kind of story
where you had to be there.

186
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,638
But I'm gonna be there.

187
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,266
For the rest of my life.

188
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,853
I can't break up with him.
I made him quit drinking.

189
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,772
-He's dull because of me.
-All right, don't say that.

190
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,359
He's probably always been dull.
You just, you know...

191
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,903
...set it free.

192
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,532
-Hi.
-Hey, Ross. Ah.

193
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,868
Hi, Russ.

194
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,621
I've just got two more tables to clean,
and then we'll go, okay?

195
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,707
Okay. I'll just sit here and, uh...

196
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,001
...chat with your, uh...

197
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,963
...friend-type people.

198
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,638
Rachel? Um, hi.

199
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,889
-Hi.
-Okay.

200
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,599
So you know what you're doing, right?

201
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,476
Ha, ha. Waitressing?

202
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,229
Well, yeah. But, no. I mean, um....

203
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,982
Doesn't Russ just
remind you of someone?

204
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,612
-Huh. Bob Saget?
-Oh, yeah.

205
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,407
-No, no, no. Oh, oh.
-Hi.

206
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,867
Oh, my, oh.

207
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,661
What-? What's wrong?

208
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,623
-I- Okay.
-She's just upset because she, uh-

209
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,959
She buttered a spider
into her toast this morning.

210
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,669
Mm-hm.

211
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,003
All right.

212
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,883
Listen, Pheebs.
This is gonna be okay.

213
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,302
Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.

214
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,889
-Hi.
-Hi.

215
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,517
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?

216
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,768
Yes. Yes, I am.

217
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,604
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?

218
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,732
Actually, I'm, uh, kind of a...

219
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,109
...you know...

220
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,237
...a date-type thing...

221
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,697
...of Rachel's.

222
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,826
-A date?
-Yeah. I'm her date.

223
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,786
Oh. Oh, you're, uh....

224
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,622
Oh, you're the date.

225
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,374
You know, this is actually good...

226
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,210
...because if we ever lose Ross,
we have a spare.

227
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,755
Oh. You are the, uh, paleontologist.

228
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,342
Yes. Yes, I am. And you are a....

229
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,262
Periodontist.

230
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,598
See? Now they're
as different as night and...

231
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,892
...later that night.

232
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,105
Well, I am going to, uh, get a beverage.
Heh.

233
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,608
-Uh, it was nice, uh, meeting you.
-Ditto.

234
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,241
I, uh- Well, I met Russ.

235
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,869
Oh.

236
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,747
Hey, I didn't know
we were, uh, seeing other people.

237
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,208
-Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
-Huh.

238
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,879
Well, uh, for your information,
there's a woman at the museum...

239
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,090
...who's curator of moths and other, uh...

240
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,302
...winged things...

241
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:09,682
...who's, uh, let it be known
that she is drawn to me, much like a...

242
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,143
...you know. Ahem.

243
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,146
Well, so far I've been keeping her at bay,
but, uh, if this is the deal-

244
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,564
Yeah, this is the deal.

245
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,775
-Okay, well, um, have a nice evening.
-Thank you.

246
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,903
-Russ, are you ready?
-Yeah.

247
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,281
-Bye.
-Bye.

248
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,744
She's dating?

249
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,412
She's dating?

250
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,749
Yes. Yes, but did you see
who she was dating?

251
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,459
What do you mean?

252
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,836
-Do you not see it?
-See what?

253
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,839
I don't know what she sees
in that goober.

254
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,720
It takes him, what?
Like, I don't know, uh...

255
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,848
...hello, a week to get out a sentence?

256
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,934
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?

257
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,646
Yeah.

258
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,947
-Hey.
-Hey.

259
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,990
Whoa, whoa.

260
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,743
I'm guessing you didn't get the part...

261
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,538
...or, uh, Italy called
and said it was hungry?

262
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,290
Well, the part's mine if I want it.

263
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,875
Oh, my God.

264
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,837
Yeah. If I'm willing to sleep
with the casting lady.

265
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,255
Oh, my...

266
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,215
...God?

267
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,594
Ten years I've been waiting for
a break like this, Chandler. Ten years.

268
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:32,515
I mean, <i>Days of our Lives.
</i>That's actually on television.

269
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,851
So, what are you gonna do?

270
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,562
I guess I could sleep with her.
I mean....

271
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,188
How can I do that?

272
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,234
Well, I've got a pop-up book
that told me everything I needed to know.

273
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,195
I've never slept with someone for a part.

274
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,530
Well, is she-?

275
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:50,867
Sorry.

276
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,203
-Is she good-looking?
-Yeah.

277
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,540
She's totally good-looking.
I mean, if I met her in a bar or something...

278
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,042
...I'd be buying her breakfast.

279
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,796
You know, after having slept with her.

280
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,637
You know, maybe this isn't
such a big deal.

281
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:17,351
I mean, the way that I see it is, you get
a great job and you get to have sex.

282
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,563
You know? Throw in a tree and a fat guy,
and you've got Christmas.

283
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:28,196
I just- I just don't think
that I want it that way though, you know?

284
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,907
I mean, let's say I do make it, all right?

285
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,285
I'm always gonna look back and wonder
if it was because of my talent...

286
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,371
...or because of, you know,
the little general.

287
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,752
Didn't you used to call it the little major?

288
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,755
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco,
I had to promote it.

289
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,262
Can I get you something from the bar?

290
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,223
Yes, I would like something.

291
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,309
No. No, thank you.

292
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,271
No, if you want a drink, it's okay with me.
I've gotta get used to it.

293
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,233
No, no, really.
I wouldn't feel right about it.

294
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,984
Just some water, please.

295
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:11,239
-So the light went out in my refrigerator.
-Scotch on the rocks with a twist.

296
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:13,991
I'm sorry.

297
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,577
Hey, we're having some fun now,
huh, Ross?

298
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,163
Wanna do another one?
Huh, Russ?

299
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,834
Okay. Eleven letters...

300
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,505
...atomic element number 101,
ends in "ium."

301
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,883
-Dysprosium.
-Ha, ha. Dysprosium.

302
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,593
Try mendelevium.

303
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,054
And weenie number two has it.

304
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:39,642
Unless of course 9 Down, "Nights in White
Satin" was sung by the Doody Blues.

305
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,107
You don't see it?
You actually don't see it?

306
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,527
-What?
-Okay, honey, you're dating Ross.

307
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,487
No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.

308
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,156
Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.

309
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,700
Steve, sleeve.

310
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,452
Okay, no one is named sleeve.

311
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,205
Phoebe, what the hell
are we talking about?

312
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,501
Other than their names being similar,
I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.

313
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,880
For your information,
it's a card sharp, not a card shark.

314
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,674
You could not be more wrong.

315
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,385
You could try,
but you would not be successful.

316
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,557
Okay, I'm gonna get some more coffee
before the pinching and eye-poking begins.

317
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,228
-I know what your problem is.
-Oh, you do, do you?

318
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,730
Mm-hm. You're jealous.

319
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,984
Uh, of what?

320
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,695
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.

321
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,490
Hey, you're a doctor of gums.

322
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,243
That's the smallest body part
you can major in.

323
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,581
It's like, day one, floss.
Day two, here's your diploma.

324
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,915
-Now, you listen—
-No, no.

325
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,917
-Let me finish.
-No, let me finish.

326
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,128
No, you let me fin—

327
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,548
-Hi.
-Hi.

328
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,343
Ew.

329
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,220
Ew, ew, ew.

330
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,019
-Did Joey say what he was gonna do?
-No.

331
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,104
I don't even think he knew.

332
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,857
Hey, would you sleep with somebody
to get a great job?

333
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,610
I don't know.
Who would I have to sleep with?

334
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,278
Me.

335
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,199
Why would I have to sleep with you?

336
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,659
It's my game. You want the job or not?

337
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,163
-Hi.
-Hey.

338
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,624
-Good morning.
-Where you going?

339
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,085
Bobby and I are going away
for the weekend. Remember?

340
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,336
Oh.

341
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,838
What's with all the bottles of liquor?

342
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,466
What's going on?
Is, uh, Bobby drinking again?

343
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,135
Oh, no, this is not for him.
This is for me.

344
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,265
That way, he's still sober, but I find
his stories about shoelaces more amusing.

345
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,232
Ugh, God. Even his knock is boring.

346
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,113
-Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
-Uh, could I talk to you a minute?

347
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,447
Sure.

348
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,744
-This is really hard for me to say.
-Oh, God. You fell off the wagon.

349
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,162
Oh, no, no.

350
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,580
It's about you.

351
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,332
What about me?

352
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,085
I think you may have a drinking problem.

353
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,840
What, these?

354
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,260
No, these are, um, for cuts and scrapes.

355
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,640
Look, I am just not strong enough to be
in a codependent relationship right now.

356
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,185
Oh, shoot.

357
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,023
Well, anyway,
I hope we can be friends.

358
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,775
Okay.

359
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,446
Take care.

360
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,157
-Okay. You too.
-Bye.

361
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,703
What happened?

362
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,998
Well, we kind of broke up.

363
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,250
Aw.

364
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,673
Does anybody want these?

365
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,091
I'll take one.

366
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,637
Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this
and pretend I'm a giant.

367
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,895
-Hey.
-Hey. How'd the callback go?

368
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,857
Ugh, it was unbelievable.
I walked in there and she was all over me.

369
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,151
-So, what did you do?
-Well, I couldn't do it.

370
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,279
-I told her I didn't want the part that way.
-Good for you.

371
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,823
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
But then after I left her office...

372
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,368
...she caught up with me at the elevator
and offered me an even bigger part.

373
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,745
So, and...?

374
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,918
So you are now looking
at Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon...

375
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,128
...recurring in at least four episodes.

376
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,797
All right!

377
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,757
All right, I gotta go shower.

378
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,522
Hi.

379
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,357
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.

380
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,943
I guess you guys heard
Rachel dumped me.

381
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,528
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

382
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,614
All she said was that I remind her
too much of somebody.

383
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,616
You have any idea who
she's talking about?

384
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,246
Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.

385
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,041
-She hates him.
-Oh.

386
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,502
-Hey.
-Hey, Julie.

387
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,837
Hey, how are you doing?

388
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,715
Oh. I don't know. I mean,
it's definitely weird not being with Ross...

389
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,009
...but I guess I'm doing okay.

390
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,096
Actually, I've got some of his stuff
that he, urn....
