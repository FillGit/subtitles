1
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,005
Coffee.

2
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,424
-Thank you.
-Cappuccino.

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,678
And a nice hot cider for Monica.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,680
Aw, thank you.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,182
-Rach?
-Yeah?

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,976
Why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,437
Oh.

8
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:21,939
Oh, heh.

9
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,815
That's why.

10
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,984
Sorry.

11
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,753
TEDLOCK:
Chandler?

12
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,631
Miss Tedlock,
you're looking lovely today.

13
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,385
May I say that is a very
flattering sleeve length on you?

14
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,220
Yes.

15
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:39,558
Well, Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office at the end of the day.

16
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,729
Oh, listen, if this is about those prank
memos, I had nothing to do with them.

17
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,231
Really, nothing at all. Really.

18
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,607
Nothing.

19
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,946
Hey, you guys. You guys.

20
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,949
Chandler's coming, and he says
he has this incredible news.

21
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,535
So when he gets here,
let's all act like, you know-

22
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,245
-Hey.
GROUP: Hey.

23
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,040
Never mind.
But it was gonna be really good.

24
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,792
ROSS: What's going on?
RACHEL: What's up?

25
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,462
It's a typical day at work.
I'm inputting my numbers...

26
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,464
...and Big Al calls me into his office...

27
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,633
...and tells me he wants to make me
processing supervisor.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,969
-That is great!
-Congratulations.

29
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,388
So I quit.

30
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,223
BOTH:
Why?

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,642
Why?
This was supposed to be a temp job.

32
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,729
Yeah, Chandler,
you've been there for five years.

33
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,314
I know, but if I took it this...

34
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,150
...it'd be like admitting
that this is what I actually do.

35
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,610
So was it a lot more money?

36
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,404
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be one of those guys...

37
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,158
...that's in his office until 12:00 at night
worrying about the WENUS.

38
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,621
"The WENUS"?

39
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,667
Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

40
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,669
Oh, that WENUS.

41
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,047
So, what are you gonna do?

42
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,424
I don't know. That's the thing.
I don't know.

43
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,676
I'm not gonna figure it out
working there.

44
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,096
Oh! I have something you can do.

45
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,515
I have this new massage client.
Steve.

46
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,019
Anyway, um, he's opening up
a restaurant...

47
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,022
...and he's looking for a head chef.

48
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,984
Um, hi there.

49
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,319
Hi.

50
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,656
Oh, yeah, I know. You're a chef, I know,
and I thought of you first.

51
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,201
But, urn, Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so....

52
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,164
Yeah, I just don't have a lot
of chefing experience.

53
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,375
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

54
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,462
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Well, what kind of food is he looking for?

55
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,632
He wants to do something eclectic,
so he's looking for someone...

56
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,801
...who can, you know,
create the entire menu.

57
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,886
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, I know.

58
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,680
So, what do you think?

59
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,560
Thanks, Pheeb. I just don't really
see myself in a big white hat.

60
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,853
Okay.

61
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,314
Oh, Monica. Guess what?

62
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,910
Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?

63
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,749
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.

64
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,711
Where you going, Mr. Suit-ey Man?

65
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,881
Well, I have an appointment
to see Dr. Robert Pilman...

66
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,674
...career counselor-a-go-go.

67
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,219
I added the "a-go-go."

68
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,763
Career counselor?

69
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,932
Hey, you guys all know
what you want to do.

70
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,809
I don't.

71
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,730
Hey, you guys in the living room
all know what you want to do.

72
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,149
You know, you have goals.
You have dreams.

73
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,650
I don't have a dream.

74
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,237
Ah, the lesser known
"I Don't Have a Dream" speech.

75
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,700
Oh, I love my life. I love my life.

76
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,702
<i>Brian's Song.</i>

77
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,831
The meeting with that guy went great?

78
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,876
So great. He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

79
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,128
It's this cute little place on 10th Street.

80
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,131
It's not too big, not too small.
It's just right.

81
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,384
Was it formerly owned
by a blond woman and some bears?

82
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,014
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him
Monday night. Kind of like an audition.

83
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,267
And Phoebe, he really wants you
to be here, which will be great for me.

84
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,810
Because you can make yummy noises.

85
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,271
-What are you gonna make?
-Yummy noises.

86
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,609
And, Monica, what are you gonna make?

87
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,320
I don't know. I don't know.
It's just gotta be so great.

88
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,781
Oh! I know what you can make. I know.

89
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,825
Oh, you should make that thing,
you know, with the stuff.

90
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:31,456
You know that thing with the stuff?

91
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,167
Okay, I don't know.

92
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,171
Hey, guys, anyone know a good date place
in the neighborhood?

93
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:43,343
Uh, how about Tony's? If you can finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

94
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,930
Okay. Ahem.

95
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,225
Hey, does anyone know a good place
if you're not dating a puma?

96
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,813
-Who are you going out with?
-Oh, is this the bug lady?

97
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,607
I love you, Ross.

98
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,528
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady.

99
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,114
She's curator of insects at the museum.

100
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,284
So, what are you guys gonna do?

101
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,620
Well, I just thought we'd go to dinner,
then bring her back to my place...

102
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,331
...and I'd introduce her to my monkey.

103
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,836
And he's not speaking metaphorically.

104
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,341
-So back to your place?
-Uh-huh.

105
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,510
You thinking maybe, heh-heh?

106
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,181
Ahem, well, I don't know, heh-heh.

107
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,767
I'm hoping heh-heh.

108
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,146
I'm telling you,
that monkey's a chick magnet.

109
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:40,859
She's gonna one look at his furry, cute
little face and it'll seal the deal.

110
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,237
-Aah!
ROSS: Celia, don't worry.

111
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,866
Celia, he's not gonna hurt you.
Soothing tones, Celia, soothing tones.

112
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,826
-Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Aah!

113
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,872
-Here, here. Marcel? Marcel?
-I can't stand this.

114
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,375
-He's got his claws on my-
-Yeah, all right.

115
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,886
Okay, try this salmon mousse.

116
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,764
-Mm. Good.
MONICA: Yeah?

117
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,391
Is it better than
the other salmon mousse?

118
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,685
It's creamier.

119
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,021
Yeah? Well, is that better?

120
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,608
I don't know.
We're talking about whipped fish, Monica.

121
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,819
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down,
you know?

122
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,619
God, what happened to you?

123
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,705
Eight and a half hours
of aptitude tests...

124
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:40,335
...intelligence tests, personality tests,
and what do I learn?

125
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,171
"You're ideally suited for a career
in data processing...

126
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,715
...for a large multi-national corporation."

127
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,387
That's so great, because you
already know how to do that.

128
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,806
Can you believe it?

129
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,476
Don't I seem like somebody who should
be doing something really cool?

130
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:00,480
You know, I just always
pictured myself doing something....

131
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,148
Something.

132
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,402
Oh, Chandler, I know, I know.

133
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:09,155
Oh, hey, you can see your nipples
through this shirt.

134
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,578
Here you go.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

135
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,249
Ooh, you know, um,
I had a grape about five hours ago...

136
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,834
...so I better split this with you.

137
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,921
It's supposed to be that small.
It's a pre-appetizer.

138
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,174
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

139
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,763
Well, it is amusing.

140
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,189
Hello? Oh, hi, Wendy.

141
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,191
Yeah, 8:00.

142
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,193
What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?

143
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,863
Okay, great.

144
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,157
All right, I'll see you then. Bye.

145
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,908
Ten dollars an hour for what?

146
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,619
I asked a waitress at work
to help me out.

147
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,663
Waitressing?

148
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,290
Uh-oh.

149
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,753
Ha, ha. Of course I thought of you.

150
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,337
But....

151
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,506
-But....
-But, but?

152
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,971
But, you see, it's just this night
has to go just perfect, you know...

153
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:19,350
...and, well, Wendy's more
of a professional waitress.

154
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,352
Oh.

155
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,397
I see. Yes. And I've sort of been
maintaining my amateur status...

156
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,566
...so that I can waitress in the Olympics.

157
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,824
You know, I don't mean to brag,
but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.

158
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,872
Amuse-bouche?

159
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,557
Talk to me.

160
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,688
Okay, uh, ahem, a weird thing happened
to me on the train this morning-

161
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,609
No, no, no. Talk dirty.

162
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,241
-Wow. Here?
-Come on.

163
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,867
Come on.

164
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,702
Say something...

165
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,287
...hot.

166
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,582
-What?
-Uh....

167
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,085
-What?
-Ooh.

168
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,671
-What?
-Urn....

169
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,130
What?

170
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,132
-What?
-Vulva.

171
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,391
"Vulva"?

172
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,812
All right, I panicked, all right?

173
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,730
She took me by surprise.

174
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,860
You know, but it wasn't a total loss.
I mean, uh, we ended up cuddling.

175
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,904
Whoa, you cuddled? How many times?

176
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,533
Shut up. It was nice. I just-

177
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,786
I just don't think I'm the dirty-talking
kind of guy, you know?

178
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,539
What's the big deal?
Just say what you want to do to her.

179
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,749
Or what you want her to do to you.

180
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,961
Or what you think other people
might be doing to each other.

181
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,756
Look, I tell you what.
Try something on me.

182
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,886
Please be kidding.

183
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,764
Why not? Come on.

184
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,643
Just close your eyes and tell me
what you'd like to be doing right now.

185
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,775
Okay, I'm, uh....

186
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,445
I'm in my apartment....

187
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,946
Yeah, what else?

188
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,908
That's it. You're not there.
We're not having this conversation.

189
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,493
-All right. Look, I'll start, okay?
-Joey, please.

190
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,079
Come on, come on.
All right, ready? Look.

191
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,206
Oh, Ross.

192
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:53,254
You get me so hot,
I want your lips on me now.

193
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,423
See?

194
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,721
-All right, now you say something.
-I, uh- I really don't think so.

195
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,264
Come on.

196
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,891
-You like this woman, right?
-Yeah.

197
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,601
-You wanna see her again, right?
-Sure.

198
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,896
Well, if you can't talk dirty to me,
how are you gonna talk dirty to her?

199
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,440
Now tell me you want to caress my butt.

200
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,572
Okay, turn around.

201
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,909
I just don't want you staring at me
when I'm doing this.

202
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,870
All right, all right.
I'm not looking. Go ahead.

203
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,372
Okay.

204
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,626
Ahem, I want, urn-

205
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,920
Okay, I want...

206
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,338
...to feel...

207
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,549
...your hot, soft skin with my lips.

208
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,718
There you go.

209
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,346
Keep going, keep going.

210
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,348
I, uh-

211
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,728
I want to take my tongue and....

212
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,904
And....

213
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,698
Say it.

214
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,286
Say it!

215
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,497
Run it all over your body...

216
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,252
...until you're trembling with-

217
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,398
With?

218
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,569
-Funny story.
-You're not gonna believe this.

219
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,154
It's okay. It's okay.

220
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,699
I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.

221
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,579
Hey, while you were sleeping,
that guy from your old job called again.

222
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,788
Oh. Again?

223
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,541
-And again and again and again.
-And again.

224
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,048
Hello? Hen. And again.

225
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,299
Ah.

226
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,219
Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 15th floor?

227
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,097
Yeah, I miss you too.

228
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:12,393
Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens
from your own home, you know?

229
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,563
Well, that's very generous.

230
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,191
Uh, but look, this isn't about the money.

231
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,401
You know? I need something
that's more than a job.

232
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,112
I need something I really care about-

233
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,491
And that's on top of the year-end
bonus structure you mentioned earlier?

234
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,992
BOTH:
Your dream.

235
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,454
Look, Al.
Al, I'm not playing hardball here, okay?

236
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,832
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection.

237
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,834
No- No, no. No, no.

238
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,586
No, stop saying numbers!

239
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:42,298
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy!
You got the wrong guy!

240
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,966
I'll see you Monday!

241
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,971
Ah.

242
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,605
Huh?

243
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,108
Wow. It's huge.

244
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,652
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

245
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,947
Oh, this is a cube.

246
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,782
Look at this.

247
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,663
You have a window!

248
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,832
Yes, indeedy.

249
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:20,336
-With a beautiful view of~
-Oh, look. That guy's peeing.

250
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,924
Okay. That's enough of the view.
All right, check this out.

251
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,677
-Ahem. Okay, sit down here. Sit down.
-Okay.

252
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,971
Okay, this is great. This is great.

253
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,432
-Ahem. You ready?
-Yeah.

254
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,351
Helen, could you come in here
for a moment?

255
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,316
Thank you, Helen, that'll be all.

256
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,821
Last time I do that. I promise.

257
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,203
Wendy, we had a deal.

258
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,497
Yeah, you promised.

259
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,292
Wendy. Wendy. Wendy!

260
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,214
Hmm, who was that?

261
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,219
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.

262
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,639
That's too bad.

263
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,975
Bye-bye.

264
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,561
-Ten dollars an hour.
-Nope.

265
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,062
Twelve dollars an hour.

266
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,858
Mon, I wish I could,
but I've made plans to walk around.

267
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:28,321
You know, Rachel, when you ran out
on your wedding, I was there for you.

268
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,408
I put a roof over your head,
and if that means nothing to you....

269
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,036
Twenty dollars an hour.

270
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,663
Done.

271
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,172
-Well, hello. Welcome to Monica's.
-Hello.

272
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,965
May I take your coat?

273
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,471
-Hi, Steve.
-Hello, Monica.

274
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,015
Hello, greeter girl.

275
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,101
-This is Rachel.
-Yeah, okay.

276
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,272
Mm, everything smells so delicious.

277
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,777
You know, I can't remember a time
I smelled such a delicious combination of—

278
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,487
Okay, smells.

279
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,281
Well, it's a lovely apartment.

280
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,076
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?

281
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,079
I was just being polite, but all right.

282
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,333
What? What's up?

283
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,712
In the cab on the way over,
Steve blazed up a doobie.

284
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,465
What?

285
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,218
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja.

286
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,719
Okay, okay, okay.

287
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,099
Okay, I'm with you, Cheech. Okay.

288
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,519
Is it dry in here?

289
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,816
Let me get you some wine.

290
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,652
Yeah, I think we're ready
for our first course too.

291
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,654
Okay....

292
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,032
These are rock shrimp ravioli...

293
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,368
-...in a cilantro ponzu sauce...
-Oh.

294
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,912
...with just a touch of minced...

295
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,419
...ginger.

296
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,672
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy.

297
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,011
These are fantastic.

298
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,805
Oh, gosh. I'm so glad you liked them.

299
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,266
Like them?
I could eat a hundred of them.

300
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,394
Oh. Well, urn....

301
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,688
That's all there is of these...

302
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,275
...but in about eight and a half minutes,
we'll be serving some delicious tartlets.

303
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,444
"Tartlets"? Heh.

304
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,279
"Tartlets."

305
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,906
"Tartlets."

306
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,785
Word has lost all meaning.

307
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,086
Excuse me.
Can I help you with anything?

308
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,672
You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

309
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,732
Oh, cool. Taco shells.

310
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,863
You know, these are- They are like a little
corn envelope, you know?

311
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,658
You know what?
You don't want to spoil your appetite.

312
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,160
Hey. Sugar-O's.

313
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,121
You know, if you just wait
another six and a half minutes-

314
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,999
Oh. Macaroni and cheese.
We gotta make this.

315
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,964
No, we don't.

316
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,258
Oh, okay.

317
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,594
Oh, sorry.

318
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,059
Yeah, why don't you
just have a seat here?

319
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,230
Okay.

320
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,108
Okay. Give me the Gummy Bears.

321
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,568
Yeah, I- No.

322
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,864
-Give them to me.
-All right, we'll share.

323
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,534
-No. Give me the bears.
-Well, then you can't have any.

324
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,411
-Give them to me.
-This is not worth it.

325
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,998
Oh, oh! Bears overboard.
They're drowning.

326
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,586
Hey, fellas. Grab onto a Sugar-O.
Save yourselves.

327
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:17,800
Help! Help! I'm drowning. Help! Help!

328
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,593
That's it, okay? Dinner is over.

329
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,928
-What?
-"What"?

330
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,513
-Why?
MONICA: "Why"?

331
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,099
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this...

332
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,561
...and you can't even wait four and a half
minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?

333
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,522
Hey....

334
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,948
What a tool.

335
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,326
You don't want to work
for a guy like that.

336
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,622
I know. It's just- I don't know,
I just thought that this was, you know, "it."

337
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,749
Look, you'll get there.
You're an amazing chef.

338
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,711
Yeah, you know all those yummy noises?
I wasn't faking.

339
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,388
So, uh, how did it go with Celia?

340
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,850
Oh, uh, I was unbelievable.

341
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,977
All right, Ross.

342
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:13,189
I was the James Michener of dirty talk.

343
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,858
It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard.

344
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:19,528
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines...

345
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,322
...themes, a motif.

346
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,241
At one point, there were villagers.

347
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,661
Oh, and, uh....

348
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,124
Well, um, you know, by the time
we finished with all the dirty talk...

349
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,877
...it was kind of late
and we were both exhausted, so....

350
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,671
-You cuddled.
-Yeah, which was nice.

351
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,841
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie or something?

352
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,135
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait
for Chandler?

353
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,679
Whoa. Where the hell is he?

354
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,182
Yes, Fran, I know what time it is...

355
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,477
...but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy.

356
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,855
Oh, really?
Well, let me tell you something.

357
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:59,610
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

358
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,114
Whoa.

359
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,086
-How's this?
-Eek!

360
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,463
-Sorry. How about over here?
-Oh!

361
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,590
See, now, that just means it's working.

362
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,926
-Does this hurt?
-No.

363
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,595
-How about this?
-Aah!

364
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,972
There you go.

365
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,355
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
