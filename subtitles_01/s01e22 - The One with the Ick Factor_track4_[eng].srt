1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,921
MONICA: Tell him. Please tell him.
-Tell him.

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,381
-Shut up.
-Tell me what?

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,884
MONICA: You won't even look at him.
-Oh, come on, tell me.

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:12,095
I could use another reason
why women won't look at me.

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,764
All right, all right, all right.

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,807
Last night, I had a dream...

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,478
...that, um, you and I were, uh....

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,522
Doing it on this table.

9
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:26,610
-Wow.
-Excellent dream score.

10
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,115
Why-? Why would you dream that?

11
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,536
More importantly, was I any good?

12
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,666
Well, you were pretty damned good.
Ha, ha.

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,294
Interesting, because in my dreams,
I'm surprisingly inadequate.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,050
Well, last night, you seemed to know
your way around the table.

15
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,847
I love it when we share.

16
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,936
CHANDLER:
You okay there?

17
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,313
I can't believe you two had sex
in her dream.

18
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,858
I'm sorry. It was a one-time thing.

19
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,529
I was very drunk,
and it was someone else's subconscious.

20
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,414
-Hello, Rachel.
-Ugh.

21
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,541
Get off.

22
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,921
Ooh. Oh, give me.
Can you see me operating a drill press?

23
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,592
I don't know. What are you wearing?

24
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,890
Pheebs, why would you want
to operate a drill press?

25
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,433
Just for some short-term work.

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,019
You know, till I get back
some of my massage clients.

27
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,104
Pirates again?

28
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,815
No. Nothing like that.

29
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,276
I'm just such a dummy.

30
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,154
I taught this
"Massage Yourself at Home" workshop.

31
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,281
And they are.

32
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,160
Hey, hey, Chan, she could work for you.

33
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,996
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

34
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,208
What? I could. I could do it. What is it?

35
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,043
Well, my secretary's gonna be out.

36
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,337
She's having one of her boobs reduced.

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,508
It's a whole big boob story.

38
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,926
I could be a secretary.

39
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,637
Well, I don't know
if it's your kind of thing...

40
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,556
...because, uh,
it involves a lot of being normal...

41
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,393
...ahem, for a large portion of the day.

42
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,686
I could do that.

43
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,232
-What are you playing with?
-It's my new beeper.

44
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,901
Why the hell does a paleontologist
need a beeper for?

45
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:17,030
Is it, like, for dinosaur emergencies?
"Help, come quick! They're still extinct!"

46
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,077
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor.
She can get me wherever I am.

47
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,956
All she has to do is dial 55-JIMBO.

48
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,376
A cool phone number
and a possible name for the kid.

49
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,130
-I'll see you guys later.
-Off to see young Ethan?

50
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,215
Thank you.

51
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,219
How young is young Ethan? Young?

52
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,763
He's our age.

53
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,015
When we were...?

54
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,688
-Okay, he's a senior in college.
-College?

55
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,398
JOEY: Ooh.
-Whoa.

56
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,818
And this man-child has no problem
with how old you are?

57
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,319
No, of course not.

58
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,321
It's not even an issue...

59
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,407
...because I told him I was 22.

60
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,867
-What?
-What?

61
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,745
-Oh, I can't pass for 22?
-Well, maybe 25, 26.

62
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,540
-I am 26.
-There you go.

63
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,096
Can you hear that?

64
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,348
Yeah. Ha, ha.

65
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,102
That'll stop when you pick up the phone.

66
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,062
Oh. Ha, ha.

67
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,066
-Okay. Ooh, I'm on.
-Okay.

68
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,445
Mr. Bing's office.

69
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,449
No, I'm sorry,
he's in a meeting right now.

70
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,326
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right-

71
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,162
Will he know what this is in reference to?

72
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,997
And he has your number?

73
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,958
All right, I'll see that he gets the message.
Bye-bye.

74
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,421
-What?
- Ross says hi.

75
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,881
Ah.

76
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,675
This is so fun.
All right, what do we do now?

77
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,887
Well, now I actually have to get to work.

78
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,722
"Most likely."

79
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,978
-Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
-Okay.

80
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,982
-All right. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

81
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,572
Yes?

82
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,449
PHOEBE :
<i>What you doing?</i>

83
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,997
Okay, windows are clean,
candles are lit.

84
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,333
Ooh, belt's too tight. Gotta change the belt.

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,628
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.

86
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,967
-Am I out of control?
-Just a touch.

87
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,260
Mon, I don't understand.

88
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:47,347
I mean, you've been dating this guy since,
like, his midterms.

89
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,393
I mean,
why all of a sudden are you so...?

90
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,146
Oh.

91
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,982
What?

92
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,943
Could tonight be the night?

93
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,696
I don't know.

94
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:08,201
Look, he's a great guy,
and I love being with him, but, you know...

95
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,953
...things happen when they happen.

96
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,621
You don't plan these things.

97
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,293
-Oh. So did you shave your legs?
-Yeah.

98
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,711
Uh-huh.

99
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,508
Would you let it go, Ross?
It was just a dream.

100
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,801
It doesn't mean-

101
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,723
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, this is it. Oh, my God.
It's baby time. Baby time.

102
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,268
All right, relax, relax, just relax, just relax.
Be cool.

103
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,813
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped.

104
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:42,903
No, Andre is not here. Third time today.

105
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,155
Yes, I am sure.

106
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:49,326
Heh. No, sir, I do not perform
those kind of services.

107
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,079
Services? Oh, services.

108
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,374
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

109
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,045
Yeah.

110
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,755
That's right.

111
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,008
That's right. "JUMBO" with a U, sir.

112
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,760
Heh. No, you don't want me.

113
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,388
Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.

114
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,683
Yeah. Alrighty, bye-bye.

115
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,147
JOEY: Hey, hey. How was the first day?
-Hey. Oh.

116
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,859
Excellent. Everyone was so, so nice.

117
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,528
See? It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.

118
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,490
-Me.
-Ah.

119
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,285
-I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
-Why not?

120
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,537
Well, because, you know.

121
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,998
They don't like you.

122
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,587
-What?
-I thought you knew that.

123
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,089
Nah-uh.

124
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,677
-Who doesn't like me?
-Everyone.

125
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,553
Except for, urn....

126
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,722
No. Everyone.

127
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,103
-What are you talking about?
-Don't feel bad.

128
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,730
You know, they used to like you a lot.

129
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,484
But then you got promoted,
and now you're all, like, Mr. Boss-Man.

130
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,278
You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing.
Boss-Man Bing.

131
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,576
-I can't believe it.
-Yeah, yeah. They even do you.

132
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,122
-They do me?
-Yeah.

133
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,582
You know, like, urn, okay:

134
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,376
"Could that report be any later?"

135
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,925
I don't sound like that.

136
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,262
-Oh, oh. Chandler.
-Oh. Yeah, you do.

137
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,557
"The hills are alive with the sound...

138
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,600
...of music."

139
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,065
"My scone!"

140
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,859
ROSS, JOEY & PHOEBE:
"My scone!"

141
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,613
Okay, I don't sound like that.
That is so not true.

142
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,494
That is so not- That is so not- That-

143
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,121
Oh, shut up.

144
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,459
Ha, ha. You did not.

145
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,586
I am telling you, up until I was 9...

146
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,589
...I thought gunpoint was an actual place
where crimes happened.

147
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,426
-Ha, ha. How is that possible?
-Think about it. It's always on the news.

148
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,262
"A man is being held up at Gunpoint."

149
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,806
"Tourists are being terrorized
at Gunpoint."

150
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:20,477
And I just kept thinking,
"Why do people continue to go there?"

151
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,899
Oh, ah.

152
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,778
-I should go.
-Okay.

153
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,910
Okay.

154
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,286
-Unless....
-What?

155
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,540
Uh, unless you wanna stay over.

156
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,501
I mean, I'm going to. So....

157
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,339
Yeah, I'd really like that.

158
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:01,017
Uh, before we get into
any staying-over stuff...

159
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,478
...there's something you should know.

160
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,147
Okay. Is this like
"I have an early class tomorrow"...

161
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,901
...or "I'm secretly married to a goat"?

162
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,863
Well, it's somewhere in between.

163
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:18,326
You see, in a strictly technical sense,
of course, I'm not, uh....

164
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,454
Well, I mean, I haven't ever, urn....

165
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,414
-Ethan?
-Yeah?

166
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,874
Are you a virgin?

167
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,837
Well, if that's what you kids
are calling it these days...

168
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,630
...then yes, I am.

169
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,053
I, uh.... I've kind of been waiting
for the right person.

170
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,224
-Really?
-Yeah.

171
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,936
You do know
I was talking about you, right?

172
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,280
Wow.

173
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,907
You keep saying that.

174
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,953
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.

175
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,957
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man...

176
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,918
...it is nothing like that.

177
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,128
Oh.

178
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,048
Listen, listen.

179
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:19,554
Um, you told me something
that was really difficult for you.

180
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,933
And, um, well, I figure if you can be honest,
then I can too.

181
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,770
-Oh, God, don't tell me I did it wrong.
-No.

182
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,480
-No, no, no.
-Oh.

183
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,734
-Nothing wrong about that.
-Oh. Ha, ha.

184
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,071
Um, okay. Here goes.

185
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,408
I'm not 22.

186
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,244
I'm 25.

187
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,663
And 13 months.

188
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,791
Huh.

189
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,127
But I figure, you know,
that shouldn't change anything.

190
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,797
I mean, what the hell does it matter
how old we are?

191
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,135
Listen, um...

192
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,471
...as long as we're telling stuff, uh...

193
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,975
...I have another one for you.

194
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,853
I'm a little younger than I said.

195
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,607
You're not a senior?

196
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,026
Oh, I'm a senior.

197
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,697
In high school.

198
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,831
Okay.

199
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,045
What we did was wrong.

200
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:38,967
Oh, God. I just had sex with someone
who wasn't alive during the bicentennial.

201
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,096
I just had sex.

202
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,518
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?

203
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,354
-You never told me how old you were.
-That's different.

204
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,857
My lie didn't make one of us a felon
in 48 states.

205
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,529
-What were you thinking?
-I wasn't thinking. I was busy falling-

206
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,781
-Don't say it.
-...in love with you.

207
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,784
Really?

208
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,953
Sorry.

209
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,163
Well, fall out of it.

210
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,750
You know, you shouldn't even be here.
It's a school night.

211
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,671
Oh, God. Oh, God.

212
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:22,093
I'm like those women that you see
with shiny guys named Chad.

213
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,056
I'm Joan Collins.

214
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,519
Who?

215
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,323
Okay, Andre should be there
in about 45 minutes.

216
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,701
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

217
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,621
Ahem. It's just easier that way.

218
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,792
Oh, come on.
You told me about the last dream.

219
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,753
No. Forget it.

220
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,757
Well, why not?
Was I doing something particularly saucy?

221
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,137
All right, fine. Um....

222
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,264
Well, you were not the only one there.

223
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,893
Joey was there too.

224
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,937
All right.

225
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,566
Was there, uh, heh...

226
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,905
...anybody else there?

227
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,157
-No.
-You sure?

228
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:30,620
Nobody, uh, handing out mints
or anything?

229
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,956
No, it was just the three of us.

230
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,750
Oh.

231
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,837
So tell me, was it like you and Chandler
and then you and me...

232
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,380
...or you and me and Chandler?

233
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,469
-You know what?
-What?

234
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,638
There were times...

235
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,057
...when it wasn't even me.

236
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,487
That is so sweet, you guys.

237
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,700
ROSS: Hey, Mon.
RACHEL: Mon.

238
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,327
Mon, Ethan called again.

239
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,124
Mon?

240
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,042
ALL:
Mon!

241
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,337
-What?
-Ethan called again.

242
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,672
Oh.

243
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,925
-You're not seeing him anymore?
-No.

244
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,469
You know,
sometimes just things don't work out.

245
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,849
And this has nothing to do with the fact
that he needs a note to get out of gym?

246
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,106
I didn't say any-
I did not say anything, I swear.

247
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,607
He stopped by.

248
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,192
JOEY:
Next time you talk to him...

249
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,363
...could you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?

250
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,327
Oh, my life is just so amusing. Heh, heh.
Can we drop it now?

251
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,745
Sorry. Sorry.

252
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,873
It's morphing time.

253
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,583
-Stegosaurus!
-Tyrannosaurus!

254
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,339
Ooh. Oh, I gotta go.

255
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,717
Whoa. Ooh, head rush. Oh.

256
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,180
One more and then I have to go.

257
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,556
Cool. Ha, ha.

258
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,020
Where you going?

259
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,731
Oh, I got a birthday party
with some work people.

260
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,608
Work people?

261
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,444
-Nobody told me.
-No, I know.

262
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:30,698
That's part of the whole, you know,
them-not-liking-you extravaganza.

263
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,120
Know what? I don't get this.
A month ago, these people were my friends.

264
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,248
Just because I'm in charge,
doesn't mean I'm a different person.

265
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,251
Well, then you should come tonight,
just hang out with them.

266
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,420
Let them see
what a great guy you still are.

267
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,672
-You think I should?
-I really do, yeah.

268
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,716
-Okay. Okay.
PHOEBE: Okay.

269
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,468
Oh, but, um, could we not go together?

270
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,598
I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss, you know?

271
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,394
CHANDLER:
I think last night was great.

272
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,105
You know, the karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing "Ebony and Ivory"?

273
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,357
-Mm-hm.
-Ha, ha.

274
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,318
You were great.
But they still made fun of you.

275
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,863
-What?
-Now you're more like Mr. Caring-Boss.

276
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,531
Mr. Tm-One-of-You"-Boss.

277
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,534
Mr. "I-Wanna-Be-Your-Buddy"-
Boss-Man-Bing.

278
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,704
Then I don't get it.

279
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,209
Well, you know what, Chandler?
I think you just gotta face it.

280
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,836
You're, like, the guy in the big office,
you know?

281
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,965
You're the one that hires them
and fires them.

282
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,842
-They still say you're a great boss.
-They do?

283
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,094
Uh-huh.

284
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,513
But they're not your friends anymore.

285
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,557
-But I just want to-
-No, but you can't.

286
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,892
-But I just want—
-Ah-ah.

287
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,779
Aren't you gonna-?

288
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,531
Oh, Carol and I have a new system.

289
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:57,451
If she punches in "911,"
it means she's having a baby.

290
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,871
-Otherwise, I just ignore it.
-What about Andre?

291
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,125
This morning he got a call
from what I think was our cousin Nathan.

292
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,044
And frankly,
it was a little more than I needed to know.

293
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,136
Hey.

294
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,221
That was gonna be my opener.

295
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,476
Hey, did you guys check out
those new hand dryers in the bathroom?

296
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,396
-I thought that was just a rumor.
RACHEL: True story.

297
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,360
All right, look, I gotta tell you something.

298
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,611
I'm not 17.

299
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,448
I only said that
so you'd think I was cute and vulnerable.

300
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,866
I'm actually 30.

301
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,453
I have a wife. I have a job.
I'm your congressman.

302
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:44,040
Monica, this is ridiculous.
We are great together.

303
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,793
We can talk, we make each other laugh.
And the sex. Oh, man.

304
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,297
Okay, I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great.

305
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,342
-It was.
-Then what's the problem?

306
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,013
Ethan, it's, urn....

307
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,058
It's icky.

308
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,727
Icky?

309
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,481
You're actually gonna throw this away
because it's icky?

310
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,817
Look, this isn't easy for me either.

311
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,569
I wish things were different.

312
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,572
If you were a few years older
or I was a few years younger...

313
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,325
...or we lived in biblical times...

314
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,870
-...I could really—
-No, don't say it.

315
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,246
-love you.

316
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,961
-Are your hands still wet?
-They're moist.

317
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,255
-Yeah, right? Ahem.
-Let's dry them again.

318
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,723
Or, like, "Could these margaritas
be any stronger?"

319
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,645
-Hey, Chandler.
-Hello, Mr. Bing.

320
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,272
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.

321
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,361
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers,
I'm gonna need them on my desk...

322
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,154
...by 9:00.

323
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,990
SANTOS: Sure.
-No problem.

324
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,412
You have to give them something,
you know?

325
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,832
Okay, that was Gerston, Santos,
and who's the guy with the mustache?

326
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,000
-Petrie.
-Petrie. Right, right, okay.

327
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,878
Well, some people
are gonna be working...

328
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,088
...this weekend.

329
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,162
RACHEL:
Oh, that's nice.

330
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,878
Ross.

331
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,306
-Ross?
-I'm here.

332
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,726
You are?

333
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,897
Uh- Ahem.

334
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,400
We were just....

335
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,027
-Wow.
-What?

336
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,616
Heh. Great. Now I'm having a baby.

337
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,327
-What?
-Oh!

338
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,412
-No. I'm having- I'm having a baby!
-Oh. Oh!

339
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,914
-Oh, my God.
-I'm having a-!

340
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,958
-The phone, the phone!
-The phone. I don't have the phone. Aah!

341
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,797
-Ross?
-I'm hurt.

342
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,180
Monica, let's go.
Come on, now, people. Woman in labor.

343
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:50,100
-Hey, Ross, look what I got going here.
-Yeah, save it for the cab, okay?

344
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,187
What are you doing?
We're going to a hospital.

345
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:56,565
What, so I can't look nice?
There might be doctors there.

346
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,110
-Joey, get out of the fridge.
JOEY: All right, all right.

347
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,696
-What is that?
-For the ride.

348
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,532
-Yeah, like in a cab you-
-Save it.

349
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,993
-Okay, hating this.
-Monica, come on, now. Let's go.

350
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,203
Baby coming. God.

351
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,497
I can't believe it. I'm gonna be an aunt.

352
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,582
-Oh, that's-
-I'm gonna have a nephew.

353
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,459
Oh, that's nice. Get out.

354
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,711
-Come on.
-Let's go, come on.

355
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,921
RACHEL:
Okay. Okay.

356
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,340
JOEY:
All right, all right, I'm going, I'm going.

357
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,724
-Here we go. Here we go.
-Rossy. Rossy.
