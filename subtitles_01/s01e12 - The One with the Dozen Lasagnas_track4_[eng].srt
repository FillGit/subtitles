1
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,977
No, no, we're done. We're done, man.

2
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,778
Aunt Silv, stop yelling.

3
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,573
All I'm saying is,
if you had told me vegetarian lasagna...

4
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,367
...I would've made vegetarian lasagna.

5
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,912
Well, the meat's only every third layer.

6
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,081
Maybe you could scrape.

7
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,917
Ross, did you really read
all these baby books?

8
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,588
Yep. You could plunk me down in
the middle of any woman's uterus...

9
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,715
...no compass...

10
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,884
...and I could find my way out like that.

11
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,595
Ooh, this is cool.

12
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:20,223
It says in some parts of the world
people actually eat the placenta.

13
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,978
And we're done with the yogurt.

14
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,731
Sorry.

15
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,985
Aunt Silv, I did this as a favor.
I am not a caterer.

16
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,280
What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

17
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,575
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

18
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,869
You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?

19
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,122
Hey, Ross, listen.

20
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,334
Do you know that right now
your baby is only this big?

21
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,960
-This is your baby.
-Heh.

22
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,504
Hi, Daddy.

23
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,963
Hello.

24
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,715
How come you don't live with Mommy?

25
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,345
How come Mommy lives
with that other lady?

26
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,186
What's a lesbian?

27
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,569
Honey, you can say it.
It's Poconos. Poconos.

28
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,198
It's like "poke a nose."

29
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,825
Ah.

30
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,161
Poke a nose.

31
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,416
Blah, blah, blah.

32
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,256
-So did I hear "Poconos"?
-Yes.

33
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,675
My sister's giving us her place
for the weekend.

34
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,344
Woo-hoo. First weekend away together.

35
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,013
-Yeah, it's a big step.
RACHEL: I know.

36
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,433
It's just a weekend. Big deal.

37
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,436
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling,
huh?

38
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,521
Shouldn't it be...

39
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,398
...flung by now?

40
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,276
I mean, we are way past the "fling" thing.

41
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,236
I'm feeling things
I've only read about...

42
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,238
...in Danielle Steel books, you know?

43
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,450
I mean, when I'm with him,
I'm just totally, totally....

44
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,369
Nauseous. I'm physically nauseous.

45
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,665
What am I supposed to do, huh?
Call Immigration?

46
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,626
I could call Immigration.

47
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,720
I love babies
with their little baby shoes...

48
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,016
...and their little baby toes
and their little hands....

49
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,310
Okay, you're gonna have to stop that...

50
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,686
...forever.

51
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,615
Need a new table.

52
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,450
You think?

53
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,959
CAROL: Hey, hey, hey. Come on in.
-Hey. Hello.

54
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,711
I brought the books...

55
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,255
...and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

56
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,007
Oh, great.

57
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,511
Is it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

58
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,349
I'm pretty sure that it is. Yeah.

59
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,811
So I got the results of the amnio today.

60
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,313
Oh, tell me. Is everything...?

61
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,940
Totally and completely healthy.

62
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,692
-Oh, that's great. That is great.
-Ha, ha.

63
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,320
Ah.

64
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:25,367
Hey. When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

65
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,994
Uh, that's our friend Tanya.

66
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,965
Of course it's your friend Tanya.

67
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,718
Don't you wanna know about the sex?

68
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,096
The sex?

69
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:51,685
Yeah, I'm having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

70
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,478
But when you throw in Tanya....

71
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,442
The sex of the baby, Ross.

72
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,779
Oh. You know the sex of the baby?

73
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,489
-Uh-huh.
-Oh, oh, oh!

74
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,992
-Do you want to know?
-No, no, no.

75
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,369
No, I don't want to know.
Absolutely not.

76
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,289
No, I think you shouldn't know until
you look down there...

77
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,499
...and see, "Oh, there it is."

78
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,751
Or isn't.

79
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,798
-Oh. Hello, Ross.
-Susan.

80
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,508
So?

81
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,010
So did you hear?

82
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,304
Yes, we did. Everything's A-okay.

83
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,307
Oh, that's so cool.

84
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,934
CAROL:
It really is. Ha, ha.

85
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,311
Do we know?

86
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,230
-We certainly do. It's going to be a-
-Hey, hey!

87
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,940
Ho, ho! Hello?

88
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,693
See, a guy who doesn't wanna know
standing right here.

89
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:46,823
Oh. Ha, ha. Uh, well, is it what
we thought it would be?

90
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,242
-Mm-hm.
-Aah!

91
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,081
What...?

92
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,418
Okay, what did we think it' was gonna be?
No, no, no.

93
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,795
I don't want to know.
Don't want to know. Okay.

94
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,922
You know, I should probably just go.

95
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,593
-Well, thanks for the books.
-No problem. Okay.

96
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,306
Susan.

97
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:21,066
All right, who should we call first?
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

98
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,029
Hello?

99
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,614
<i>Uh....</i>

100
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,784
<i>Nevermind. I don't wanna know.</i>

101
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,038
Okay, so just because it was my table,
I have to buy a new one?

102
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,956
That's the rule.

103
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,834
What rule? There's no rule.

104
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,544
If anything, you owe me a table.

105
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,090
-How did you get there?
-I believe this piece of furniture was fine...

106
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,968
...until your little breakfast adventure
with Angela Delveccio.

107
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,928
You knew about that?

108
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,763
The impressions you made
in the butter...

109
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,682
...left little to the imagination.

110
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,102
Okay, okay. How about if we split it?

111
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,188
What do you mean, like, buy it together?

112
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,606
Yeah.

113
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,984
Do you think we're ready
for something like that?

114
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,112
-Why not?
-Well, it's just a big commitment.

115
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,823
I mean, what if one of us
wants to move out?

116
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,158
-Why, are you moving out?
-I'm not moving out.

117
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,411
You'd tell me if you were moving out,
right?

118
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:19,374
-Yes, it's just that, with my last roommate-
-Oh, I know all about Kip.

119
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,419
We bought a hibachi together,
and then he ran off and got married...

120
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,878
...and things got pretty ugly.

121
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,007
So let me ask you something.

122
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,800
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

123
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,553
Oh, don't do that.

124
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,811
You've got a couple changes
in your schedule.

125
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,398
Your 4:00 herbal massage
has been pushed back to 4:30.

126
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,568
And Ms. Summerfield
canceled her 5:30 Shiatsu.

127
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,027
Okay. Thanks.

128
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,238
Oh. Here comes your 3:00.

129
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,241
I don't mean to sound
unprofessional, but, yum.

130
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:01,332
Oh. Paolo. Hi.
What are you doing here?

131
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:07,380
Uh, Rachella tell me you...

132
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,882
...massage?

133
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,718
Yeah, well, Rachella's right. Yeah.

134
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:16,973
Oh.

135
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,768
Okay, I don't know what you just said,
so let's just start.

136
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,272
Uh, I am, uh...

137
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,524
...being naked?

138
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,109
Um, that's really your decision.

139
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,237
I mean, some people prefer,
you know, to take off-

140
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,365
Ooh, oops! Being naked.

141
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,620
I can't believe you don't want to know.
I mean, I could not know.

142
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:42,373
I mean, if the doctor knows,
and Carol knows, and Susan knows-

143
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,417
And Monica knows.

144
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,003
Heh. How could you?
I don't even know.

145
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,132
Carol called to thank me for the lasagna.
I asked. She told me.

146
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,759
So, what's it going to be?

147
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,302
Whoa.

148
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,806
Huh? Oh, great.
Now he knows and I don't know.

149
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,475
I'm sorry. I'm just excited
about being an aunt.

150
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,393
Or an uncle.

151
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,567
GROUP:
Hey, Phoebe. Hey, Pheebs.

152
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,236
Fine.

153
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,074
-Phoebe, what's the matter?
-Nothing. I'm sorry.

154
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,076
I'm just- I'm out of sorts.

155
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,411
Hey, can we get
some cappuccino over here?

156
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,873
Oh, right. That's me.

157
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,419
Hey, Chandler.
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

158
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,754
Fine.

159
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:33,132
Phoebe. What is it?

160
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:38,054
-You know Paolo?
-I'm familiar with his work, yes.

161
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,515
Look, he made a move on me.

162
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,768
-Whoa. The store will be open tomorrow.
-More coffee over here, please.

163
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,277
Well, what happened?

164
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,320
Well, he came in for a massage...

165
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,447
<i>...and everything was fine until....</i>

166
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,495
-My God.
-Are you sure?

167
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,415
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

168
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:14,007
<i>And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.</i>

169
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,429
Was it...?

170
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,098
Oh, Boy Scouts
could've camped under there.

171
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,766
GROUP:
Ooh.

172
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,769
-"Ooh," what?
-ma Thurman.

173
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,104
-Oh.
-The actress.

174
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,064
Uma Thurman!

175
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,734
Thanks, Rach.

176
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,613
-What are you gonna you do?
-You have to tell her.

177
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,532
You have to tell her.
It's your moral obligation as a friend...

178
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,077
...as a woman. I think it's a feminist issue.
Guys? Guys?

179
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,121
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.

180
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,789
Feminist issue? That's where I went.

181
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,084
She is gonna hate me.

182
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,711
Yeah, well.

183
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,429
Will you pick one? Just pick one.

184
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,931
Here, how about that one?

185
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,683
That's patio furniture.

186
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:10,647
So what? Like people are gonna come in
and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again."

187
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,106
Fine.

188
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,234
What about the birds?

189
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,362
I don't know. Birds just don't say:

190
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,198
"Hello, sit here. Eat something."

191
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,784
You pick one.

192
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,327
How about the ladybugs?

193
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,706
Oh, so forget about the birds,
but big red insects suggest fine dining?

194
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,209
Fine. Do you want the birds?
Get the birds.

195
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,253
Not like that, I won't.

196
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,840
Kip would've liked the birds.

197
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,520
-Hey.
-Hi, Pheebs.

198
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:51,980
Are you moving out?

199
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,190
No, these aren't all of my suitcases.

200
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,109
This one's Paolo's.

201
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,735
Urn....

202
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,572
Um, Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

203
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,367
Well, sure. Just for a sec, though...

204
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,786
-...because Paolo's on his way over.
-Oh.

205
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,956
Okay. Urn....

206
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:11,958
Okay.

207
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,418
Um....

208
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,586
-Oh, Pheebs....
-Um, okay.

209
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:21,175
Um, ahem. We haven't known each other
for that long a time.

210
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,178
And, um, there are three things
that you should know about me.

211
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,765
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

212
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,352
Two, I never lie.

213
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,481
And three, I make the best
oatmeal-raisin cookies in the world.

214
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,112
Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.

215
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,994
Mm, my God.

216
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,331
Why have I never tasted these before?

217
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,790
Oh, I don't make them a lot...

218
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,418
...because I don't think it's fair
to the other cookies.

219
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,923
Ahem, God.

220
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,636
Well, you're right. These are the best
oatmeal-raisin cookies I've ever had.

221
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,557
-Which proves that I never lie.
-I guess you don't.

222
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,309
Paolo made a pass at me.

223
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,355
So, what do you think?

224
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,775
I think it's the most beautiful table
I've ever seen.

225
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,401
I know.

226
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,613
So how does this work? Gonna balance
the plates on these little heads?

227
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,199
Who cares? We'll eat at the sink.
Come on.

228
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,619
Heads up, Ross.

229
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,663
Score! You suck.

230
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,502
Are you okay?

231
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,464
I need some milk.

232
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,635
I've got milk.

233
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,058
Here you go.

234
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,734
Better?

235
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,862
No.

236
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,784
Ugh! I feel so stupid.

237
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,203
I think about the other day,
with you guys, you know.

238
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,165
And I was all,
"Oh, Paolo. He's so great.

239
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,626
He makes me feel so-" Ugh!

240
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,378
God.

241
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,255
I'm so embarrassed.

242
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,257
I'm so embarrassed.

243
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,842
I'm the one he hit on.

244
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,136
I unleashed him on you.
If I'd never met him...

245
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,720
...this would've never happened.

246
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,014
-I'm so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

247
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,432
BOTH:
No, I'm sorry.

248
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,976
Oh, wait. Oh.

249
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,395
-What are we sorry about?
-I don't know.

250
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,605
Right. He's the pig.

251
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,483
-Such a pig.
-Oh, God, he's such a pig.

252
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,237
-Oh, he's like a big disgusting pig....
-Yeah, like a-

253
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,739
-Pig man.
-Yes, good. Okay.

254
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,997
Oh, but he was my pig man.

255
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,834
How did I not see this?

256
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,795
Oh, I know!

257
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,883
Because...

258
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,926
...he's gorgeous.

259
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,761
And he's charming.

260
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,556
-And when he looks at you-
-Okay. Okay, Pheebs.

261
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,224
The end.

262
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,936
Ugh. God.

263
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,940
Should I not have told you?

264
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,944
No, trust me,
it's much better that I know.

265
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:34,452
Uh, I just liked it better before.
It was better.

266
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,178
I think she took it pretty well.

267
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,889
You know, Paolo's over there
right now, so....

268
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,350
Yeah, we should get over there
and see if she's okay.

269
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,518
Just one second.

270
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,605
-Whoo! Score.
-Game. Us.

271
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,023
Yes.

272
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,901
Come on, Pheebs.

273
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,236
Whoo.

274
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,280
Well, it looks like, uh,
we kicked your butts.

275
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,698
No, no. She kicked our butts.

276
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,493
You could be on the Olympic
"Standing There" team.

277
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,161
Come on. Two on one.

278
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,081
What are you still doing here?
She just broke up with the guy.

279
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,582
It's time for you to swoop in.

280
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,502
What? Now?

281
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,295
Yes. Now is when you swoop.

282
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,297
You gotta make sure
that when Paolo walks out...

283
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,174
...the first guy Rachel sees is you.

284
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,843
She's got to know
that you're everything he's not.

285
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,971
You're like- Like the anti-Paolo.

286
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,683
My Catholic friend is right.

287
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,352
She's distraught. You're there for her.

288
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,730
You pick up the pieces,
and then you usher in:

289
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,275
The Age of Ross.

290
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,449
RACHEL:
See this? See?

291
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,248
-How's it going?
MONICA: Don't stare.

292
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,875
She just finished throwing
his clothes off the balcony.

293
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,378
Now there's just a lot of gesturing
and arm-waving.

294
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:11,215
Okay, that is either, "How could you?"
or "Enormous breasts."

295
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,677
Here he comes.

296
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,315
Uh, I am, uh...

297
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,774
...to say goodbye.

298
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,985
Oh, okay, bye-bye.

299
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,698
Paolo.

300
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:39,285
I really hate you for what you did to Rachel.
But I still have five of these...

301
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,455
...so heat it at 375
until the cheese bubbles.

302
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,919
Paolo, I just wanna tell you...

303
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,007
...and I think I'd speak
for everyone when I say....

304
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,848
PHOEBE:
Oh. Just look at her.

305
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:04,018
Oh, you guys, I really think only one of us
should go out there...

306
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,062
-...so she's not overwhelmed.
-Oh, right.

307
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,939
And I really think it should be me.

308
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,829
BOTH:
Hey.

309
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,999
You all right?

310
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,586
Oh. I've been better.

311
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,633
Come here.

312
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,266
Listen...

313
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,894
...you deserve so much better than him.

314
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,647
You know? I mean, you....

315
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,984
You should be with a guy who knows
what he has when he has you.

316
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,946
Ross....

317
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,240
What?

318
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,618
I'm so sick of guys.

319
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,413
I don't want to look at another guy.

320
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,915
I don't want to think about another guy.

321
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:11,293
I don't even want to be near another guy.

322
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,965
Huh.

323
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,887
-Ross, you're so great.
-Oh, ha, ha.

324
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,859
MONICA: Are you all right?
PHOEBE: Are you okay?

325
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,694
Medium. Heh.

326
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,363
-Any cookies left?
-Yeah.

327
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,117
Heh. See, Rach, urn....

328
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:47,705
See, I don't think swearing off guys
altogether is the answer. I really don't.

329
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:52,626
I think what you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

330
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,797
No. No. I just need
to be by myself for a while.

331
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,841
You know?
I just gotta figure out what I want.

332
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,177
No, no.

333
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,681
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

334
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,725
No, I know. I know.

335
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,687
And I'm sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

336
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,107
-What?
-What?

337
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,069
I'm having a boy?

338
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,863
Uh, no.

339
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,868
No. In fact, you're not having a boy.

340
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,120
I'm having a boy.

341
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,748
Am I having a boy?

342
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,793
-You're having a boy.
-Aah!

343
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,504
-I'm having a boy. I'm having a boy.
-Yes!

344
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,797
-What?
-What is it?

345
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,341
I'm having a boy. I'm having a boy.

346
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,967
Hey.

347
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,971
We already knew that.

348
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,893
I'm having a son.

349
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:54,939
Urn....

350
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,654
Yes. And that would be a shutdown.

351
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,113
Shutout!

352
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,119
Where you guys going?
Come on, one more game.

353
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,623
-Oh. It's 2:30 in the morning.
-Yeah. Get out.

354
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,001
You guys are always hanging out
in my apartment.

355
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,712
Come on, I'll only use my left hand,
huh?

356
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,965
Come on, wussies.

357
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,388
-All right. Okay. I gotta go.
-Mm-hm.

358
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:28,973
I'm going.

359
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,933
And I'm gone.

360
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,187
-One more game?
-Oh, yeah.
