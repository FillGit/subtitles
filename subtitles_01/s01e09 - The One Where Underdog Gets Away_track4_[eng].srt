1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,552
Terry, I know I haven't worked here
very long...

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,472
...but I was wondering,
do you think it would be possible...

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,725
...if I got a $100 advance on my salary?

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,685
An advance?

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,313
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving
with my family.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,776
See, every year, we go skiing in Vail,
and normally my father pays for my ticket...

7
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,196
...but I've sort of started
this whole independent thing, you know...

8
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,574
...which is actually why I took this "job."

9
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,579
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart.

10
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,290
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.

11
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,044
Really, really awful.

12
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,382
Okay, I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,217
Urn....

14
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:54,513
But I'm trying really hard,
and I think I'm doing better.

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,099
I really do.

16
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,475
Does anybody need coffee?

17
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,310
MAN: Yeah, over here.
WOMAN: Yeah, I do.

18
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,898
Heh. Look at that.

19
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,410
Excuse me, sir?
Hi. You come in here all the time.

20
00:01:58,577 --> 00:01:59,995
MAN: Uh-huh.
-I was just wondering...

21
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,123
...you think there's a possibility
you could give me an advance on my tips?

22
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,292
Huh? No.

23
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,755
RACHEL: Okay, okay. That's fine, fine.
Sorry about that spill before.

24
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,176
Only 98.50 to go.

25
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,345
-Hey. Hey.
ROSS & CHANDLER: Hey.

26
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,223
Ross, did you know that Mom and Dad
are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,392
What? No, they're not.

28
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,145
-Yes, they are. The Blymans invited them.
-You're wrong.

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,191
-I am not wrong.
-You're wrong.

30
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,361
No, I just talked to them.

31
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,364
I'm calling Mom.

32
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:41,953
-Hey, hey.
MONICA & CHANDLER: Hey.

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,789
-Hey.
-Coffee.

34
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,335
And this from the Cry for Help Department:
Are you wearing makeup?

35
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:51,963
Yes, I am.

36
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,759
As of today, I am officially
Joey Tribbiani, actor/model.

37
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,010
Thank you.

38
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:02,015
That's funny, I was thinking you look more
like Joey Tribbiani, man/woman.

39
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,185
What were you modeling for?

40
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,562
You know those posters
for the City Free Clinic?

41
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,440
Oh, wow. You're gonna be one of those
healthy, healthy, healthy guys?

42
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,984
-Ah?
-The asthma guy's really cute.

43
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,611
-Oh, he is.
RACHEL: Isn't he?

44
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,822
-You know which one you're gonna be?
-No, no.

45
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,866
But I hear Lyme disease is open,
so, you know....

46
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,119
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

47
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,537
Thanks.

48
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,710
Well, you were right.
How can they do this to us, huh?

49
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,294
It's Thanksgiving.

50
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,131
Aw. Tell you what.
How about if I cook dinner at my place?

51
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,341
I'll make it just like Mom's.

52
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,428
Will you make the mashed potatoes
with the lumps?

53
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,431
You know they're not actually
supposed to-?

54
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,683
I'll work on the lumps.

55
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,561
-Joey, you're going home, right?
-Yeah.

56
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,898
And I assume, Chandler, you're still
boycotting all the Pilgrim holidays?

57
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,943
Yes, every single one of them.

58
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,529
Phoebe, you're gonna be
with your grandma?

59
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,822
Yeah, and her boyfriend.

60
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,742
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving
in December because he's lunar.

61
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,624
So you're free Thursday, then?

62
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,210
-Yeah. Oh, can I come?
-Yeah.

63
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,256
Rach, you still thinking
you're gonna make it to Vail?

64
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,134
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop.

65
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:23,013
-Only $102 to go.
-I thought it was 98.50.

66
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,849
Yeah, well, it was, but I broke a cup.

67
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,686
Well, I'm off to Carol's.

68
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,731
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

69
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,941
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife...

70
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,446
...and will probably wanna
bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.

71
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,541
Hi. Is Carol here?

72
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,086
-No, she's at a faculty meeting.
-Oh.

73
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,173
Well, I just came by to pick up my skull.

74
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,550
Well, not mine, but....

75
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,886
-Come in.
-Thanks.

76
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:07,307
Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class,
and I have to get it back to the museum.

77
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,267
What's it look like?

78
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,561
Kind of like a big face without skin.

79
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,651
Yes, heh, I'm familiar with the concept.

80
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,403
-We can just look for it.
-Okay.

81
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:30,747
Wow, you guys, hen, sure have a lot
of books about being a lesbian.

82
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,962
Well, you know,
you have to take a course.

83
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,757
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

84
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:53,186
Hey, hey, <i>Yertle the Turtle. </i>A classic.

85
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,106
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

86
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,444
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

87
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,863
Uh, wouldn't that mean you're...

88
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,699
...crazy?

89
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,536
What, you don't think
they can hear sounds in there?

90
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,915
You're not serious.
I mean, you really talk to it?

91
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,877
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.

92
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,047
Do you, uh-? Do you talk about me?

93
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,135
-Yeah, yeah. All the time.
-Really?

94
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:30,765
But, um, we just refer to you as
"Bobo the sperm guy."

95
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:46,239
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think
I should get some belly time too.

96
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,700
I mean, not that I believe any of this.

97
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,495
Oh, I believe it.
I think the baby can totally hear everything.

98
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,039
-Really?
-I can show you.

99
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,665
This will seem a little weird.

100
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,793
But you put your head
inside this turkey...

101
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:03,173
...and then we'll all talk,
and you'll hear everything we say.

102
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,594
I'd just like to say
I'm totally behind this experiment.

103
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,806
In fact,
I'd very much like to butter your head.

104
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,938
ROSS: Hey.
MONICA: Hey, Rach.

105
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,857
-Did you make your money?
RACHEL: No, not even close.

106
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,109
Forget Vail. Forget seeing my family.

107
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:27,364
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

108
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,367
Uh, Rach...

109
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,660
...here's your mail.

110
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,453
Thanks. You can just put it on the table.

111
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,914
Heh. No.

112
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,416
Here's your mail.

113
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,754
Thanks. You can just put it on the table.

114
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,173
Would you just open it?

115
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,386
Oh, my God.

116
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,806
-Oh, you guys are great.
-Aw. Ha, ha.

117
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,058
RACHEL: Aw.
-We all chipped in.

118
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,228
-We did?
-You owe me 20 bucks.

119
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,897
Thank you. Thank you so much.

120
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,733
Chandler, here you go.
Got your traditional holiday feast.

121
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,026
Got your tomato soup...

122
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:09,239
...your grilled-cheese fixings,
and your family-size bag of Funyuns.

123
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,033
Wait, this is what you're having
for Thanksgiving dinner?

124
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,786
What is it with you and this holiday?

125
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,497
All right, I'm 9 years old.

126
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,332
-Aw.
-Aw, I hate this story.

127
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,418
We've just finished Thanksgiving dinner.

128
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,839
I have- And I remember this part vividly,
—a mouthful of pumpkin pie.

129
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,093
And this is the moment my parents
choose to tell me they're getting divorced.

130
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,636
Oh, my God.

131
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:36,224
It's very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

132
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,659
Hi.

133
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,121
-We used to work together.
-We did?

134
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,124
Yeah, at Macy's.
You're the Obsession girl, right?

135
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,710
-Yes.
-I was the Aramis guy.

136
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,674
-Aramis? Aramis? Aramis?
-Oh.

137
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:10,925
Yeah, right.

138
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,137
I gotta tell you,
you're the best in the business.

139
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,972
-Get out.
JOEY: I'm serious.

140
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,560
You're amazing. You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.

141
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,229
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.

142
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,357
Mm, mm.

143
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,153
You smell great tonight.
Uh, what are you wearing?

144
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,072
Nothing.

145
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,626
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink
or something?

146
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,670
Yeah, that would be-

147
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,008
-What's wrong?
-I just remembered I have to do something.

148
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,968
Oh. What?

149
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,553
Urn....

150
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,597
Leave.

151
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,391
JOEY:
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

152
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,143
So I guess you all saw it.

153
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,646
-What?
-Saw what?

154
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,525
No, we're just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.

155
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,378
Hey.

156
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:14,340
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.

157
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,553
Tonight, on a very special <i>Blossom.</i>

158
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,566
MONICA:
Mm, looking good. Okay.

159
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:36,404
Cider's mulling, turkey's turking,
yams are yamming.

160
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,197
What?

161
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,782
I don't know.

162
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,243
It's just not the same
without Mom in the kitchen.

163
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,830
Ugh. All right, that's it.
Get out of my way and stop annoying me.

164
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,708
Well, that's closer. That's....

165
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,877
I got the ticket, I got the ticket.

166
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,964
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop.

167
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,717
Oh, you must stop shooping.

168
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,261
Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.

169
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,430
Chandler, will you just come in, already?

170
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:06,309
No, thank you. I prefer to keep
a safe distance from all this merriment.

171
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,645
Look out. Incoming pumpkin pie.

172
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,490
Okay, we all laughed when you did it with
the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.

173
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,662
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.

174
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,872
That's not a question.

175
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,792
But my mom always makes them.
It's like a tradition.

176
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,921
You get a little piece of turkey on your fork,
a little cranberry sauce, and a Tot.

177
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,134
I mean, it's bad enough
I can't be with my family...

178
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,262
...because of my disease.

179
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,640
All right, fine.

180
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,977
Tonight's potatoes
will be both mashed with lumps...

181
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,687
...and in the form of Tots.

182
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,522
Yes.

183
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,275
All right,
I'm off to talk to my unborn child.

184
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,780
-Ah.
-Okay, Mom never hit.

185
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,245
PHOEBE:
Okay, all done.

186
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,581
What? Phoebe, did you whip the pota-?

187
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,250
Ross needs lumps.

188
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I just-

189
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:19,799
I thought we could have them whipped
and then add some peas and onions.

190
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,467
Why would we do that?

191
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,928
Then they'd be just like
my mom used to make it...

192
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,722
...you know, before she died.

193
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,228
Okay, three kinds of potatoes coming up.

194
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,732
Okay. Goodbye, you guys.

195
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,191
Thanks for everything.

196
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,654
Oh, God, look at- Sorry. I'm so sorry.

197
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,743
The most unbelievable thing has happened.
Underdog has gotten away.

198
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,538
-The balloon?
-No, no, the actual cartoon character.

199
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,208
Of course the balloon.

200
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,711
It's all over the news.
Before he reached Macy's...

201
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,214
...he broke free and was spotted
flying over Washington Square Park.

202
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,551
-I'm going to the roof. Who's with me?
-Well, I can't. I gotta go.

203
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,054
An 80-foot inflatable dog
loose over the city?

204
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,223
-How often does that happen?
-Almost never.

205
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,186
-Got the keys?
-Okay.

206
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,941
Any time you're ready.

207
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,819
Okay.

208
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,988
Okay, here we go.

209
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,492
Oh....

210
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,455
Okay, where am I talking to here?
I mean, uh....

211
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:37,418
Well, there is one way that seems to offer
a certain acoustical advantage, but....

212
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,962
Just aim for the bump.

213
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,799
Okay.

214
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,884
Okay, okay.

215
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,095
Okay, here goes.

216
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,854
You know, I— You know, I can't do this.

217
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,108
This is- It's too weird. I feel stupid.

218
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,902
All right, so don't do it. It's fine.

219
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,905
You don't have to do it
just because Susan does it.

220
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:10,743
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.

221
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,747
-that moment when we first saw
the giant dog shadow fall over the park?

222
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,084
But did they have to shoot him down?
I mean, that was just mean.

223
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:23,423
Okay, right about now the turkey
should be crispy on the outside...

224
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,258
...and juicy on the inside.

225
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,719
Why are we standing here?

226
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,265
We're waiting for you to open the door.
You've got the keys.

227
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,183
No, I don't.

228
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:39,105
Yes, you do.
When we left, you said, "Got the keys."

229
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,985
No, I didn't. I asked, "Got the keys?"

230
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,989
No, no, no. You said, "Got the keys."

231
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,409
Either of you have the keys?

232
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,288
-The oven is on.
-Oh, I've gotta get my ticket.

233
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,541
-Wait. We have a copy of your key.
-Well, then get it, get it!

234
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,043
Hey, hey.
That tone won't make me go any faster.

235
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,004
-Joey.
-That one will.

236
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,967
ROSS:
And everyone's telling me:

237
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,262
"You gotta pick a major.
You gotta pick a major."

238
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:16,517
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

239
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:22,064
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, let's face it, you're a fetus.

240
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,444
You're just happy
you don't have gills anymore.

241
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,406
Look, you don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.

242
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,409
Oh, please.
I am not singing to your stomach, okay?

243
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,871
-How's it going?
ROSS: Shh, shh, shh.

244
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,915
<i>Here we come</i>

245
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,375
<i>Walkin' down the street</i>

246
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:45,254
<i>Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet</i>

247
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,631
<i>Hey, hey-</i>

248
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,845
-Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
-I did.

249
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,514
-Well, does it always, uh-?
-No, no, that was the first.

250
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,100
-Keep singing. Keep singing.
ROSS: Oh.

251
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,978
<i>Hey, hey, you're my baby</i>

252
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,439
<i>And I can't wait to meet you</i>

253
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,943
<i>When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
And then we'll go to the zoo</i>

254
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,363
I felt it that time.

255
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,031
<i>Hey, hey, I'm your daddy</i>

256
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,950
<i>I'm the one without any breasts</i>

257
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,208
-Nope, not that one.
-Can you go any faster with that?

258
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,543
Hey, I got one keyhole
and about a zillion keys.

259
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,504
You do the math.

260
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,715
Why do you guys have so many keys
in there anyway?

261
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,593
For an emergency just like this.

262
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,222
All right, listen, smirky.

263
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,474
If it wasn't for your stupid balloon...

264
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,811
...I would be on a plane,
watching a woman do this right now.

265
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,980
But I'm not.

266
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,316
I swear you said you had the keys.

267
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,152
No. I wouldn't say I had the keys
unless I had the keys.

268
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,113
And I obviously did not have the keys.

269
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,033
Okay, all right, that's it.
Enough with the keys. No one say "keys."

270
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,163
Why would I have the keys?

271
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,332
Aside from the fact
that you said you did?

272
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,835
-But I didn't.
-Well, you should have.

273
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,336
MONICA: Why?
RACHEL: Because.

274
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,547
Why? Because everything
is my responsibility?

275
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,341
Isn't it enough
that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner?

276
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,679
Everyone wants a different kind of potato,
so I'm making different kinds of potatoes.

277
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,849
You know, does anybody care
what kind of potatoes I want?

278
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,644
No, no, no!

279
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,856
You know, just as long as Phoebe
gets her peas and onions...

280
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,983
...and Mario gets his Tots.

281
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:33,029
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I-

282
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,615
It's all burnt, and I can't....

283
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,745
Okay, Monica,
only dogs can hear you now, so....

284
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,663
Look, the door's open. Here we go.

285
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,290
Oh, God.

286
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,709
-Ooh.
-Oh.

287
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,006
Well, the turkey's burnt.

288
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:56,677
Potatoes are ruined.
Potatoes are ruined. Potatoes are ruined.

289
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,262
<i>Here we come</i>

290
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,513
<i>Walkin' down the-</i>

291
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,686
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

292
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,815
No, it doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps, Ross?

293
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,276
Well, here you go, buddy. You got one.

294
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,113
Oh, God, this is great.

295
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,700
The plane is gone,
so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.

296
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,621
Hey, we all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice.

297
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,206
Oh, really?

298
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,916
So why was I busting my ass...

299
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,418
...to make this delicious
Thanksgiving dinner?!

300
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,046
-You call that delicious?
-You be quiet!

301
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,008
All right, stop it, stop it, stop it!

302
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,011
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.

303
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,403
PHOEBE: Ew.
-What?

304
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,073
PHOEBE: Ugly Naked Guy's
taking his turkey out of the oven.

305
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,784
JOEY, ROSS & MONICA:
Eh.

306
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,870
PHOEBE:
Oh, my God. He's not alone.

307
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,247
Ugly Naked Guy...

308
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,583
...is having Thanksgiving dinner
with Ugly Naked Gal.

309
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,462
JOEY:
I gotta see this.

310
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,173
ALL:
Aw.

311
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,384
All right, Ugly Naked Guy.

312
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,971
Ooh, ugly naked dancing.

313
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,682
It's nice that he has someone.

314
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,528
Shall I carve?

315
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:38,779
By all means.

316
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,948
CHANDLER:
All right.

317
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,581
Okay, who wants light cheese
and who wants dark cheese?

318
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,501
I don't even wanna know
about the dark cheese.

319
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,296
-Does anybody wanna split this with me?
-Ooh, I will.

320
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,922
Mm. You guys have to make a wish.

321
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,927
-Make a wish?
-Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

322
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,435
Ooh. You got the bigger half.
What did you wish for?

323
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,604
The bigger half.

324
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,150
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.

325
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,777
-A little toast here. Ding, ding, ding.
ALL: Mm.

326
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,906
This isn't exactly
the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...

327
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,868
...but for me this has been really great,
you know?

328
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,788
I think because it didn't involve divorce...

329
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,789
...or projectile vomiting.

330
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,794
I was just thinking,
if you'd gone to Vail...

331
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,882
...or if you guys had been with your family,
or if you didn't have...

332
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,592
...syphilis and stuff...

333
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,138
...we wouldn't be all together, you know?

334
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,973
So I guess what I'm trying to say...

335
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,021
...is that I'm very thankful
that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

336
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,482
RACHEL & JOEY:
That's so sweet.

337
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,651
RACHEL:
Thank you.

338
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,319
ROSS:
Mm.

339
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,613
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.

340
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,073
And a crappy New Year.

341
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,534
ALL:
Hear, hear.
