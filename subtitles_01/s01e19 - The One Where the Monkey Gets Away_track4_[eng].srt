1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,088
Okay, okay, I checked.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:09,134
We have Earl Grey, English Breakfast,
cinnamon stick...

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:13,138
...chamomile, mint medley,
blackberry and, uh....

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,891
Oh, wait, there's one more, urn....
Lemon soother.

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,063
You're not the guy that asked
for the tea, are you?

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,898
Okay.

7
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,828
Mail call. Rachel Green, bunk seven.

8
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,788
Thank you.

9
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,875
Oh, cool. A free sample of coffee.

10
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,962
Oh, good, because where else
would we get any? Ha, ha.

11
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,924
Oh, right.

12
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,927
-Oh, great.
-What is it?

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,680
Country club newsletter.

14
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:41,601
My mother sends me
the engagement notices for inspiration.

15
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,062
Oh, my God.

16
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,398
Oh, my God. It's Barry and Mindy.

17
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,483
-Barry, who you almost-?
-Barry, who I almost-

18
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,193
-Mindy, your maid of-
-My maid of-

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,988
Let me see. That's Mindy?

20
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,448
Wow, she is pretty.

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,118
Lucky...

22
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,122
...to have had a friend like you.

23
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,504
Marcel, bring me the rice.
Come on, bring me the rice. Come on.

24
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,631
Good boy. Good bye.
Come here, give me the rice.

25
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,383
Thank you. Good boy.

26
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,720
Well, I see he's mastered the difference
between "bring me the"...

27
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,764
...and "pee in the."

28
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,311
"Bring me the" and- Rach?

29
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,271
-What?
-Hi.

30
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,857
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh.

31
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,734
This is so stupid.

32
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,195
-I mean, I gave Barry up, right?
-Mm.

33
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,280
I should be happy for them.

34
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,699
I am. I'm happy for them.

35
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,451
-Really?
-No.

36
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:44,414
Oh. Oh, I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.

37
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,792
Whoa, what, uh, ha, ha....

38
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,462
What happened to, uh,
"Forget relationships.

39
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,341
I'm done with men"?
The whole, uh, penis embargo?

40
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,097
Oh, I don't know.

41
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,265
I guess it's not about no guys.

42
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,768
-It's about the right guy, you know?
-Hmm.

43
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,480
With Barry, it was safe and it was easy,
but there was no heat.

44
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,107
-Mm.
-You know, with Paolo...

45
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,817
...that's all there was, was heat.

46
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,237
And I mean, it was just
this raw, animal, sexual-

47
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,698
Right, right. I got it.

48
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,866
I was there.

49
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,452
I mean, do you think
you can ever have both?

50
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,080
You know?
Someone who's like your best friend...

51
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,624
...but then also can make
your toes curl.

52
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,292
Yes, yes.

53
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,421
Yes. Yes, I do. I really do.

54
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,172
Uh, in fact, it's funny.

55
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,385
Very often, someone who
you wouldn't think could...

56
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,887
...curl your toes...

57
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,473
...might just be the one who-

58
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,766
Hi.

59
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,226
-gets interrupted. Hi.

60
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,186
Hey, guys, how was the movie?

61
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,021
-Oh, so wonderful.
-Oh, it was so good.

62
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,108
-Suck fest.
-Total chick flick.

63
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies...

64
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,823
...with, like, you know, like,
guns and bombs...

65
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,284
...and, like, buses going really fast.

66
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,539
Hey, I don't need violence
to enjoy a movie...

67
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,458
...just so long as there's a little nudity.

68
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,878
-There was nudity.
-I meant female nudity.

69
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,798
All right, I don't need to see
Lou Grant frolicking.

70
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,676
MONICA & CHANDLER & PHOEBE:
Hugh. Hugh Grant.

71
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,680
All right, I've got to go. Ahem.

72
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,432
Come on, Marcel. Come on.

73
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,436
Yeah, we're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.

74
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,439
They're still just friends, right?

75
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,320
And I will see you tomorrow.

76
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,573
That's right. You're gonna spend tomorrow
at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you?

77
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,618
Hang on, hang on.
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

78
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,662
Please, Aunt Monica, please? Ha, ha.

79
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,873
Oh, unclench.
You're not even gonna be here.

80
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,299
CHANDLER:
I can't believe we're having this discussion.

81
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,636
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.

82
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,640
Don't you think if things were gonna happen
with Rachel, they would've happened?

83
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,351
I'm telling you,
she said she's looking for a relationship...

84
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,311
...with someone exactly like me.

85
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,188
She really said that?

86
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,565
Well, I added the "exactly like me" part.

87
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:21,196
But she said she's looking for someone.
And someone is gonna be there tonight.

88
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,697
"Tonight" tonight?

89
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,909
Well, I think it's perfect.
It's just gonna be the two of us.

90
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,454
She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.

91
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,293
I can't remember the last time
I got a girl to take care of my monkey.

92
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,843
Anyway, you know, I figured after work,
I'd go pick up a bottle of wine...

93
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,556
...go over there and, uh, try to woo her.

94
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,642
Hey, you know what you should do?

95
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,354
You should take her back to the 1890s
when that phrase was last used.

96
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,527
<i>If you keep this up...</i>

97
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,280
<i>...you'll be finished with this sucker
by the end of the week.</i>

98
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,658
Now, the one in the feathered boa,
that's Dr. Francis.

99
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,244
Now, she used to be a man.

100
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,039
Oh, look. See, now, there's Raven.
We hate her.

101
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,958
We're glad she's dying.

102
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,752
And then-- What? Marcel.

103
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,339
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You know you're not supposed to-

104
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,301
Whoa, whoa.

105
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,554
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

106
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,849
Oh, Marcel. Bad monkey.

107
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,226
Oh, God.

108
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,895
Oh.

109
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,358
Sorry, Barry.

110
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,527
A little engagement gift.

111
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,572
I'm sure you didn't register for that.

112
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,165
Who died? Who died?

113
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,294
Roll him over. Oh, come on, roll him over.
Oh!

114
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:03,882
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because-

115
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,010
Marcel? Marcel? Marc-?

116
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,306
-How could you lose him?
-I don't know, I don't know.

117
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,100
We were watching TV,
and then he pooped in Monica's shoe....

118
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,063
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?

119
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,149
I don't know. The left one.

120
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,442
Which ones?

121
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,738
Oh, those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.

122
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,491
-Hey.
GROUP: Hey.

123
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,285
Whoa, oh.
Why is the air in here so negative?

124
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,707
-Rachel lost Marcel.
-Oh, no. How?

125
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,043
-He pooped in my shoe.
-Which one?

126
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,504
Those cute little black ones
I wear all the time.

127
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,673
No, which one? Ha, ha.

128
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,966
The right or left?

129
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,095
Because the left one is lucky.

130
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,846
Come on, you guys.
What am I gonna do?

131
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,015
All right, all right, all right.
You're a monkey...

132
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,850
...you're loose in the city.

133
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,811
Where do you go?

134
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,771
Okay, it's his first time out...

135
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,149
...so he's probably gonna want
to do some of the touristy things.

136
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:09,072
I'll go to <i>Cats.
</i>You go to the Russian Tea Room.

137
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,575
Oh, my God! Come on, you guys.

138
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,036
He's gonna be home any minute.
He's gonna kill me.

139
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,664
Start with the building.
You take the first and second floor.

140
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,541
Phoebe and I will take third and fourth.

141
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,001
Whoa, whoa. What am I gonna do?

142
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,795
Okay, you stay here
and just wait by the phone.

143
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,424
Spray Lysol in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kill you.

144
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,009
Does anybody want to trade?

145
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,977
What do you want?

146
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,397
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey.
Have you seen it?

147
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,400
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?

148
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,568
No.

149
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,279
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle
in the hall?

150
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,114
I wasn't ready for it.

151
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,116
The monkey, have you seen a monkey?

152
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,202
I saw Regis Philbin once.

153
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,913
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

154
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,167
You owe me a waffle.

155
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,255
Okay, he's a black capuchin monkey
with a white face...

156
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,593
...with Russian dressing
and pickles on the side.

157
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,095
Okay, thanks.

158
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,890
-Hi.
-Hey. How did it go today?

159
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,893
-Oh, great. It went great. Really great.
-Yeah.

160
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,145
-Hey, is that wine?
-Yeah. Yeah.

161
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,813
You, uh, want some?

162
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,774
-Oh, I would love some.
-Yeah.

163
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,443
But you know what? You know what?
Let's not drink it here.

164
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,154
I'm feeling kind of crazy.
Do you want to go to Newark?

165
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,910
Uh, okay. Yeah.

166
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,997
We could do that. But before we head off
to the murder capital of the Northeast...

167
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,251
...I was, uh, kind of wanted
to run something by you.

168
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,671
You know how we were,
you know, talking before...

169
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,132
...about relationships and stuff, well....

170
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,303
-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this.
-Okay, quick and painful.

171
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,605
Oh, God.

172
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,650
Okay, all right. All right, okay.

173
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,151
Ross, please don't hate me.

174
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,237
Oh, what? What? What?

175
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,991
You know Marcel?

176
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,203
-Yeah?
-Well, ahem.

177
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,998
I kind of, uh- I kind of lost him.

178
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,723
I can't believe this.

179
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,477
I mean, all I asked you to do
was keep him in the apartment.

180
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,854
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

181
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,147
You know what?
I guess it's partially my fault.

182
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,650
I shouldn't have asked you
to start off with a monkey.

183
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,820
I should have started you off with, like,
a pen or a pencil.

184
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,447
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can.

185
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,575
I've got everybody looking
for him and I got-

186
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,788
-Who is it?
LUISA : <i>Animal Control.</i>

187
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,458
-See, I've even got Animal Control.
-You called Animal Control?

188
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,460
Uh-huh.

189
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,881
Why? Do you not like them?

190
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:19,888
Heh. Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

191
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,559
I'm not allowed to have him in the city.

192
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,979
If they find him,
they'll take him away from me.

193
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:32,275
Okay, well, now, see,
you never ever, ever told us that.

194
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,529
That's right, because I didn't expect you
we're gonna invite them to the apartment.

195
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,328
Hi. Thanks for coming.

196
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,913
Somebody called about a monkey?

197
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,292
Oh. Oh, you know what?
That was a complete misunderstanding.

198
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,878
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.

199
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,463
-It turned out it was a hat.
-Cat.

200
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,381
Cat. What did I say?

201
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,383
Hi. We checked
the third and fourth floor.

202
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,093
-No one's seen Marcel.
-Marcel?

203
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,428
My uncle Marcel.

204
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,139
Oh, is that who the monkey's
named after?

205
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,515
Okay.

206
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,936
Are you aware that possession
of an illegal exotic is punishable...

207
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,481
...by up to two years in prison
and confiscation of the animal.

208
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,107
PHOEBE:
Oh, my God.

209
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,735
You'd put that poor little creature in jail?

210
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,912
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about
saying things quietly to yourself first?

211
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,207
Yes, but there isn't always time.

212
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:37,382
Look, I'm sure there's some friendly way
to reconcile this. Urn, have a seat.

213
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,926
First of all, we haven't been introduced.
I'm Monica Geller.

214
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,012
Oh, my God, you are.

215
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,598
-And you're Rachel Green.
-Yeah.

216
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,060
Luisa Gianetti. Lincoln High?

217
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,355
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

218
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:56,567
Oh! Luisa. Oh, my God.

219
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,945
Monica. It's Luisa!

220
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,155
Luisa. From homeroom.

221
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,824
Yes!

222
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,327
-You have no idea who I am, do you?
RACHEL: No.

223
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,162
Not at all.

224
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,583
Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.

225
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:16,254
Would it have been so hard to say,
"Morning, Luisa"...

226
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,423
...or "Nice overalls"?

227
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,471
Oh, I'm so sorry.

228
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,559
It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own problems.

229
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,188
But you. What a bitch.

230
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,316
What?

231
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,902
You know what? Be that as it may.

232
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,365
You think you could you help us out here
on that monkey thing, for old times' sake?

233
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,409
Go, Bobcats.

234
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,912
I could. But I won't.

235
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,416
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

236
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,044
<i>Da, da, da</i>

237
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,173
Sorry.

238
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,470
CHANDLER:
Marcel?

239
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,971
JOEY:
Marcel?

240
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,182
-Marcel?
-Marcel?

241
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,939
Hi, can I help you?

242
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:25,323
Uh, we're kind of having an emergency,
and, ahem, we were looking for something.

243
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,202
-A monkey.
-Yes, have you seen any?

244
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,080
No. No, I haven't seen a monkey.

245
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,956
Do you know anything
about fixing radiators?

246
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,585
Sure, sure. Did you try turning the knob
back the other way?

247
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,380
-Of course.
-Oh. Then, no.

248
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,303
Taste this daiquiri.
Is there too much rum in here?

249
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,098
Just a second.
Hope you find your monkey.

250
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,266
Oh, no, wait. No, no, no. Wait, wait.

251
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,937
Um, we may not know
about radiators, per se...

252
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,106
...but we do have a certain amount
of expertise...

253
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,775
...in the heating and cooling milieu.

254
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,823
Uh, weren't we kind of in the middle
of something here?

255
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,409
Yes, but these women are very hot
and they need our help.

256
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,579
And they're very hot.

257
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,708
We can't, all right?

258
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,377
We're sorry.

259
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,548
You have no idea how sorry.
But we promised we'd find this monkey.

260
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,968
If you see him, he's about yea high
and answers to the name Marcel.

261
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,680
So if we could get some pictures of you,
you'd really be helping us out.

262
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,525
Okay, from now on, you don't get
to talk to other people.

263
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,111
-Marcel?
-Marcel.

264
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,029
PHOEBE & MONICA:
Marcel?

265
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,865
Marcel?

266
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,867
Marcel?

267
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,618
-Oh, my God.
-What?

268
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,745
Something just brushed up
against my right leg.

269
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,414
-What is it?
-Oh.

270
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,250
Oh, it's okay. It was just my left leg.

271
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,628
MONICA:
Look, Phoebe.

272
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,464
Oh, yeah. Oh, Marcel. Come here.

273
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,799
-Oh, come here, Marcel.
-Step aside, ladies.

274
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,554
-What are you gonna do?
-Just a small tranquilizer.

275
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,780
PHOEBE:
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel!

276
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,824
-Damn.
-Are you okay?

277
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,452
Oh, yeah, I think so.

278
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,412
Oh.

279
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,415
Huh.

280
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,542
Whoa.

281
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,378
Oh, gosh.

282
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,931
ROSS & RACHEL:
Marcel. Marcel.

283
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,391
This is ridiculous.
We've been all over the neighborhood.

284
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,143
He's gone. He's just gone.

285
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,480
-Ross, you don't know that.
-Oh, come on. It's cold, it's dark.

286
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,982
He doesn't know the Village.

287
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,485
And now I have a broken foot. Oh, my-

288
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,112
I have no monkey and a broken foot.

289
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,489
Thank you very much.

290
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,700
Ross, you know, I've said I'm sorry,
like, a million times.

291
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,287
What do you want me to do? Huh?
You want me to break my foot too?

292
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,456
Here, I'm gonna break my foot right now.
Ow!

293
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:24,168
Oh, my God. There, are you happy now?

294
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,213
Yeah, yeah. You know,
now that you kicked the sign...

295
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,217
...hey, ha, ha,
I don't miss Marcel anymore.

296
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,846
You know, it's not like
I did this on purpose.

297
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,391
No, no, no. No, no.
This is just vintage Rachel.

298
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,143
I mean, things just sort of happen
around you.

299
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,689
I mean, you're off in Rachel Land,
doing your Rachel thing...

300
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:49,777
...totally oblivious to people's monkeys
or to people's feelings and-

301
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,154
-I don't even want to hear it.
-Ross.

302
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,739
-Forget it, okay?
-Ross.

303
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,658
What? What?

304
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,746
Hey, banana man.

305
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,671
Oh, this is so intense.

306
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:13,718
One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.

307
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,516
Hi. Did you order some bananas?

308
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,102
-What about it?
-Give me my monkey back.

309
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,395
I don't have a monkey.

310
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,440
-Then what's with all the bananas?
-Potassium.

311
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,778
Marcel? Marcel.

312
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,115
Okay, where is he? Where is he?
Marcel? Marcel?

313
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,119
Marcel.

314
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,705
What have you done to him?

315
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,416
That's my monkey. That's Patty.
Patty the monkey.

316
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,961
Are you insane?

317
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,381
-Come here, Marcel. Come on.
-Come here, Patty.

318
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,383
Come here, Marcel.

319
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,885
Come here, Patty.

320
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,055
Here, monkey. Here, monkey.
Here, monkey.

321
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,931
Gotcha.

322
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,393
-Okay, give me my monkey back.
-That's my monkey.

323
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,646
You're gonna have to take this up
with the judge.

324
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,065
That's not my monkey.
Just the dress is mine.

325
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,192
You can send it back whenever.

326
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,486
-All right, I want my monkey.
-No.

327
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,697
-Oh, come on, Luisa.
-Sorry, prom queen.

328
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,117
You had to be a bitch in high school,
you couldn't have been fat.

329
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,122
All right, look, in high school,
I was the prom queen...

330
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,668
...and I was the homecoming queen
and the class president and you...

331
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,753
...were also there.

332
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,421
Look, if you take this monkey...

333
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,675
...I will lose one of the most
important people in my life.

334
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:40,054
You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.

335
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,474
Come on, Luisa, you have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

336
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,267
Take it.

337
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,189
No.

338
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,649
All right.

339
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,527
Well, then how about I call
your supervisor and I tell her...

340
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,571
...that you shot my friend
in the ass with a dart.

341
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,790
Hey, it'll be nice to get this off finally,
won't it?

342
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,960
Or we can leave it on for now.
That's fine.

343
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:15,131
You know, with the right pair of pumps,
that would be a great little outfit.

344
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,469
Listen....

345
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,597
I'm sorry I was so hard on you before.
You know, I just-

346
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,934
No, Ross, come on. No, no. It was my fault.
I almost lost your-

347
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,145
No, no. Yeah, but you were the one
who got him back.

348
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,813
You know, you were great.

349
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,863
Hey, we still have that bottle of wine.

350
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,449
Are you in the mood for, uh...

351
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,950
...something grape?

352
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:46,954
-Sure, that would be good.
-All right, uh....

353
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,085
Oh.

354
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,550
The, uh- The neighbors
must be vacuuming.

355
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:09,310
Well, ah, as long as we're here...

356
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,939
...and not on the subject, um, ahem....

357
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,609
I was thinking about, uh...

358
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,822
...how mad we got at each other before.

359
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,038
And, um, I was thinking maybe
it was partially because of how we-

360
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,457
-Rachel?
-Barry?

361
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,169
I can't. I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy.

362
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,089
-I'm still in love with you.
-Oh!

363
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,515
We have got to start locking that door.

364
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,108
This is me in <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

365
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,569
-You see the von Trapp kids?
-No.

366
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,655
That's because I'm in front of them.

367
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,449
Yeah, I thought that was an alp.

368
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,118
Well, high school
was not my favorite time.

369
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,412
I don't know. I loved high school,
you know?

370
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,500
It was just, like, four years
of parties and dating and sex and-

371
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,920
Yeah, well, I went to boarding school
with 400 boys.

372
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,465
Any sex I had would've involved
a major lifestyle choice.

373
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,096
Gosh, doesn't it seem like
a million years ago?

374
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,517
Oh, oh, oh.

375
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,727
Oh, my butt cheek is waking up.
