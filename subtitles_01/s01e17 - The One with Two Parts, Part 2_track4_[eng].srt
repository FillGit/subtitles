NARRATOR:
<i>Previously </i>on Friends:

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,048
-Excuse me, miss.
-It's Phoebe.

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,342
-Will that be all?
CHANDLER: They're twins.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,053
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot.

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,973
-It's for Ursula.
-Sure, yeah. Okay, it fits.

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,934
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,896
How did he do this?

8
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,440
It's this whole stupid Ursula thing.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,860
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

10
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,321
-You don't know my sister.
-Talk to Joey.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,366
-He's falling in love with her.
-You won't lose him.

12
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:36,036
They haven't even slept together yet.
That's not serious.

13
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,123
Oh. Um, yeah.

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,667
May we help you?

15
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,628
Rachel! Rachel!

16
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,089
I'm okay. I'm okay.

17
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,926
RACHEL:
Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow.

18
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,470
Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow.

19
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,474
Uh, hi, uh, my friend was taking down
our Christmas lights...

20
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,936
...and she fell off the balcony
and may have broken her foot or ankle.

21
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,730
My God, you still have
your Christmas lights up?

22
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,901
Fill this out and bring it back.

23
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,613
-Okay. Here you go.
-Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow.

24
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,992
MONICA:
Okay. Whew.

25
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,285
All right.

26
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,995
Name...

27
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,496
...address....

28
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,916
Okay. In case of emergency, call...?

29
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,334
You.

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,752
Really?

31
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,421
Yeah.

32
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,590
Oh, that is so sweet.

33
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,844
Oh, gosh. I love you.

34
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,595
Okay, insurance?

35
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,807
Oh, yeah, check it.
Definitely gonna want some of that.

36
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,476
You don't have insurance?

37
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,312
Why? How much is this gonna cost?

38
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,315
I have no idea, but X-rays alone
could be a couple hundred dollars.

39
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,984
-What are we gonna do?
-There's not much we can do.

40
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,739
Uh, unless I use yours.

41
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,575
No, no, no, no, no.

42
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,076
Well, now, wait a second.

43
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,496
Who did I just put as my
"in case of emergency" person?

44
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,498
That's insurance fraud.

45
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,503
Well, all right, then. Forget it.
Might as well just go home.

46
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,047
-Ow, ow, ow, ow!
-Okay, okay.

47
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,010
-Okay, come here. I hate this.
-Thank you. I love you.

48
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:20,390
Hi, heh. Um, I'm gonna need
a new set of these forms.

49
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,933
Why?

50
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,437
I am really an idiot.

51
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,024
You see, I was filling out
my friend's form...

52
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,401
...and instead of putting
her information...

53
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,903
...I put mine.

54
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,030
You are an idiot.

55
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:39,201
Yep, that's me. Heh.
I am that stupid.

56
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,247
I had a dream last night
where I was playing football with my kid.

57
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,333
-That's nice.
-That's nice.

58
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,377
No, no. With him.

59
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,716
I'm on this field,
and they hike me the baby.

60
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:00,180
I know I've gotta do something because the
Tampa Bay defense is coming right at me.

61
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,600
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.

62
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,894
Right, but...

63
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:11,108
...it is just me and the baby,
so I'm thinking they can take us.

64
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,986
And so I, uh, heh....

65
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,738
I just heave it downfield.

66
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,865
What are you, crazy?
That's a baby.

67
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,326
He should take the sack?

68
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,333
Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield.

69
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,421
And I realize that I'm the one
who's supposed to catch him, right?

70
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,382
Only I know there's no way
I'm not gonna get there in time.

71
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,426
So I am running and I'm running...

72
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,302
...and that is when I woke up.

73
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,931
See, I am so not ready
to be a father.

74
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,058
Hey, you're gonna be fine.

75
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,645
You're one of the most caring,
responsible men in North America.

76
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,023
You're gonna make a great dad.

77
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,861
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby
just need better blocking.

78
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,034
Oh. Have either of you ever been to
the Rainbow Room? Is it expensive?

79
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,953
Only if you order stuff.

80
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,582
I'm taking Ursula tonight.
It's her birthday.

81
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,835
-Whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
-When's that?

82
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,587
ROSS:
Uh...

83
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,505
...tonight.

84
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,092
Ugh, man, what are the odds
of that happening?

85
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,971
You take your time.

86
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,644
There it is.

87
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,608
So, what are you gonna do?

88
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:39,321
What can I do? I don't want
to screw it up with Ursula.

89
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,614
And your friend Phoebe?

90
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,743
If she's my friend, hopefully
she'll understand. Wouldn't you guys?

91
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,078
Man, if you tried that on my birthday...

92
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,582
...you'd be staring at
the business end of a hissy fit.

93
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,213
You add a pinch of saffron,
it makes all the difference.

94
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,468
Okay, uh....

95
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,553
-Monica?
-Yes?

96
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,764
Yes, she is.

97
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,642
-Hi. This is my friend Rachel.
-Hi.

98
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,393
Hi, uh, Rachel, I'm Dr. Mitchell.

99
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,104
And I'm his friend Dr. Rosen.

100
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,024
Aren't you a little cute
to be a doctor?

101
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,484
Excuse me?

102
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,611
God, young, young.
I meant young, heh.

103
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,071
Young to be a doctor.

104
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,073
-Oh, good, Rach.
-Thank you.

105
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,324
Right.

106
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,753
So he said it was just a sprain,
and that was it.

107
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,256
Uh, you left out the stupid part.

108
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:40,966
It's not stupid.

109
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:45,554
The very cute doctors asked us out
for tomorrow night, and I said yes.

110
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,057
I think it's totally insane.
I mean, they work for the hospital.

111
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,185
It's like returning
to the scene of the crime.

112
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,815
-I say we blow off the dates.
-What? Monica, they are cute.

113
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,694
They are doctors. Cute doctors.
Doctors who are cute.

114
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,655
All right, what have
we learned so far?

115
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,207
ALL:
Surprise!

116
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,718
What the hell are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me.

117
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,388
-Was that the cake?
-Yeah.

118
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,974
I got a lemon shmush.

119
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,685
Come on.
She'll be here any minute.

120
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,770
RACHEL:
I hope it's okay.

121
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,985
"Happy Birthday, Peehee."

122
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,448
Maybe we can make
a B out of one of those roses.

123
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,117
Yeah, we'll just use
our special cake tools.

124
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,828
-Hey, what's going on?
CHANDLER: Oh, we just-

125
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,496
ALL:
Surprise!

126
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,498
Oh, oh, oh!

127
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,752
This is so great.

128
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,003
Oh, my God.

129
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,088
This was not at all scary.

130
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,007
Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty.

131
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,467
Betty, hi.

132
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,970
You found Betty.
Oh, my gosh. This is so great.

133
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,599
Everybody I love is in the same room.

134
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,517
Where's Joey?

135
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,772
Did you see Betty?

136
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,994
I tell you, I wouldn't mind having a piece
of this sun-dried-tomato business.

137
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:38,166
Five years ago, if somebody'd said to me,
"Here's a tomato that looks like a prune"...

138
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,752
...I'd have said,
"Get out of my office."

139
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,966
Dad, before I was born,
did you freak out at all?

140
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,927
I'm not freaking out.
I'm just saying...

141
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,929
...if someone had come to me
with the idea-

142
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:55,684
Dad, Dad, Dad. I'm talking about
the whole, uh, baby thing.

143
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,770
Did you, uh, ever get this sort of...

144
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,441
...panicky, "Oh, my God, I'm gonna
be a father" kind of a thing?

145
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,984
No.

146
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,697
Your mother really did the work.
I was busy with the business.

147
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,782
I wasn't around that much.

148
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,993
Is that what this is about?

149
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,953
No, no, Dad. I was just wondering.

150
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,623
There's time to make up for that.
We can do stuff together.

151
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:23,253
You always wanted to go to colonial
Williamsburg. How about we do that?

152
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,714
Thanks, Dad. Really, heh.

153
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,591
You know, I just, I just....

154
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,553
I just needed to know, um...

155
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,848
...when did you start
to feel like a father?

156
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:41,187
Oh. Well, I guess it must have been
the day after you were born.

157
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,858
We were in the hospital room,
your mother was asleep...

158
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,903
...and they brought you in
and gave you to me.

159
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,239
You were this ugly little red thing.

160
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,953
And all of a sudden, you grabbed
my finger with your whole fist...

161
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,747
...and you squeezed it...

162
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,707
...so tight.

163
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,461
And that's when I knew.

164
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,467
So you don't want to go
to Williamsburg?

165
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,722
We can go to Williamsburg.

166
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,641
Eat your fish.

167
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,231
MONICA:
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.

168
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,900
RACHEL:
Okay, coming.

169
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,778
Hi, come on in.
Hey, Michael, Jeffrey.

170
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,362
-Hi.
-Hi.

171
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,655
Uh, here, we brought wine.

172
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,993
Look at this. It's from the cellars
of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.

173
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,913
-So how could we resist?
-Oh, that's great.

174
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,207
-So, Monica, how's the ankle?
-It's, uh....

175
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,586
Why don't you tell them?

176
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,755
After all, it is your ankle.

177
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,217
You know, it's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.

178
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,094
Listen, why don't you guys sit down,
and we'll get you some glasses.

179
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,180
-Okay.
-Okay.

180
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,100
-Um-
-Stat.

181
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,022
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we
just tell them who we really are?

182
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,151
-I mean, I think it'll be fine.
-It will not. We'll get in trouble.

183
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,278
Monica, would you stop being
such a wuss?

184
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,324
A wuss? Excuse me
for living in the real world.

185
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,952
-So?
-So they still seem normal.

186
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,411
That's because they are.

187
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,331
You have to admit, when we go out
with women we meet at the hospital-

188
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,667
Would you relax?
Take a look around.

189
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,128
There are no pagan altars.

190
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:33,091
No piles of bones in the corners.

191
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,468
They're fine. Go like this:

192
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:43,393
I said we are not going to do it, okay?
Sometimes you can be such a big baby.

193
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,228
-I am not a baby.
-Be serious.

194
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,605
-You get uptight—
-You act like a princess.

195
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,233
-You know what? You know what?
-What? What?

196
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:54,362
Every day you are becoming
more and more like your mother.

197
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,490
Excuse me. Hello, here we go.

198
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,578
This is a great place.
How long have you lived here?

199
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,747
Thanks. I've been here
about six years.

200
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,126
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.

201
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,713
See, I was supposed to get married...

202
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,965
...but, um, I left the guy at the altar.

203
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,220
-Really?
-Yeah.

204
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,181
Yeah, I know
it's pretty selfish, but, heh...

205
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,809
...hey, that's me.

206
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,857
-Why don't you try the hummus?
RACHEL: Ahem.

207
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,400
So, Monica, what do you do?

208
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,904
Uh, I am a, uh, chef
at a restaurant uptown.

209
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,573
-Oh, good for you.
-Yeah, it is.

210
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:44,829
Mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do.

211
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,958
Well, this hummus is great.

212
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,877
God bless the chickpea.

213
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:56,966
Oh, God.

214
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,636
I am so spoiled.

215
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,933
That's it.

216
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,229
And by the way, have I mentioned
that back in high school...

217
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,813
...I was a cow?

218
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,276
I used to wet my bed.

219
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,988
I use my breasts to get
other people's attention.

220
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,115
We both do that.

221
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,216
Monica and Rachel's apartment.

222
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,428
Uh- Uh, yeah, just one second.
Uh, Rachel, it's your dad.

223
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,641
Hi, Dad.

224
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,851
No, no. It's me.

225
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,605
Listen, Dad,
I can't talk right now. Urn....

226
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,899
But there's something, urn....

227
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,944
There's something
that I've been meaning to tell you.

228
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,487
Excuse me.

229
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,948
Remember back in freshman year?

230
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,118
Well, Billy Dreskin and I
had sex on your bed.

231
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,504
Daddy....

232
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,466
Daddy- Daddy, why?
Why would I sleep with Billy Dreskin?

233
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,969
His father tried to put
you out of business.

234
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,679
You are dead.

235
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,102
Ross, he's got the remote again.

236
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,520
Good.

237
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,064
Maybe he can switch it back.

238
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,278
Maybe not.

239
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,197
Hello?

240
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,701
Uh, ueah.... Uh....

241
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:51,122
Okay, uh, hold on a second and let me
just check and see if she's here.

242
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,251
It's the woman from the hospital.
There's a problem with the form.

243
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,170
Oh, God, what do we do?

244
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,213
I don't know.
Just find out what they want.

245
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,299
Okay. No, you do it.

246
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,218
Hello. This is Monica.

247
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,762
Yeah?

248
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,181
Oh. Okay.

249
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,725
Yes, we'll be right down.
Thank you.

250
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,645
We forgot to sign
one of the admissions forms.

251
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,107
-Okay, you're right, this wasn't worth it.
-Thank you.

252
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,068
-Okay, let me just change.
-Yes.

253
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,239
-Hey.
-Hey.

254
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,241
Trouble?

255
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,620
Your sister stood me up
the other night.

256
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,457
Oh, no. Don't you hate it
when people aren't there for you?

257
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,379
-Did you try calling her?
-I've been trying for two days.

258
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,381
When I called the restaurant,
they said she was too busy to talk.

259
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,301
I can't believe
she's blowing me off.

260
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,780
Hey.

261
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,324
Oh.

262
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,411
Um, you got a minute?

263
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,497
Um, yeah, I'm just working.

264
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,632
-So....
-Uh-huh?

265
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,553
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.

266
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,346
Oh, wow, you remembered.

267
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,312
Oh. It's a Judy Jetson Thermos.

268
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,814
Right. Like the kind you-

269
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,190
Right.

270
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,026
Oh, I got something for you too.

271
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,445
How'd you know I was coming?

272
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,781
Um, yeah, urn, "twin" thing.

273
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,369
I can't believe you did this.

274
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,371
I can't believe you...

275
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,248
...did this.

276
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,671
So, what's the deal with, um,
you and Joey?

277
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,840
Oh, right.

278
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,843
He is so great. But that's over.

279
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,596
-Does he know?
-Who?

280
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:17,101
Joey. You know, um, ahem,
he's really nutsy about you.

281
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,061
He is? Why?

282
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,230
-You got me.
-Right.

283
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,523
Excuse me...

284
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,401
...doesn't this come
with a side salad?

285
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,863
So, um, are you gonna call him?

286
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,949
-What, you think he likes me?
-No. Joey.

287
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:37,079
Oh. No, no. He is so smart.
He'll figure it out.

288
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,956
Do you want some chicken?

289
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,084
No, no.
No food with a face, remember?

290
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,129
You have not changed.

291
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:46,881
Yeah, you too.

292
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,095
-Hi. Remember us?
-Mm-hm.

293
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:57,558
Um, yeah, you just called about needing
a signature on the admissions form?

294
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,269
Well, it turns out
we need a whole new one.

295
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,563
Because, um, you see...

296
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,233
...I put the wrong name again.

297
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,778
-Because, um-
-You're that stupid.

298
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,740
I am. I'm that stupid.

299
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,826
Yeah, and I'm just gonna pay
for this with a check.

300
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,079
You know, your insurance will cover that.

301
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,873
Yeah, I know.
I'm just not that bright either.

302
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,585
Okay, worst case scenario:

303
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,214
-Say you never feel like a father.
-Uh-huh.

304
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:32,343
Say your son never feels
connected to you as one.

305
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,472
Say all of his relationships
are affected by this.

306
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,391
Do you have a point?

307
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,519
You know, you'd think I would.

308
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,524
What's up with the simian?

309
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,652
It's just a fur ball.

310
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,155
Okay, whose turn is it?

311
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,324
Yours. I just got 43 points for "kidney."

312
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,078
No, you got zero points for "idney."

313
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,622
I had a K. Where's my K?

314
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,632
You've got to help me.
My monkey swallowed a K.

315
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,342
Get that animal out of here.

316
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:17,013
The animal hospital is way across town.
He's choking. I don't know what to do.

317
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,890
-What's going on?
-Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.

318
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,646
Excuse me.
This hospital is for people.

319
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,232
Lady, he is people.
He has a name, okay?

320
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,067
He watches <i>Jeopardy....</i>

321
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,029
...he touches himself
when nobody's watching.

322
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,615
Please, have a heart.

323
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,075
-I'll take a look at him.
-Oh, thank you.

324
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,368
-Michael.
-Rachel.

325
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,619
-What?
-Monica.

326
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,622
-Oh.
-Hi.

327
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,177
Hey.

328
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,262
Urs.

329
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,765
What are you doing here?
I've been trying to call you.

330
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,975
Listen, urn....

331
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,021
Don't say "listen." I know that
"listen." I've said that "listen."

332
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,315
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,360
I don't get it.
What happened?

334
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,029
What about everything
you said under the bridge?

335
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,324
Yeah, um, ahem....

336
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,744
You know, just forget about
what I said under the bridge.

337
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,164
I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.

338
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,875
You don't drink.

339
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,586
That's right, I don't.

340
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,089
But I was drunk on you.

341
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,051
-Oh, Urs.
-But, yeah, so it's not gonna work.

342
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,429
Why? Is it because
I'm friends with Phoebe?

343
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,475
If it was, would you
stop hanging out with her?

344
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,687
No.

345
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,647
No, I couldn't do that.

346
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,109
Um, then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.

347
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,279
So you know, it's either her or me.

348
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,867
Then, uh.... Then I'm sorry.

349
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,082
You know...

350
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,626
...you're gonna be
really, really hard to get over.

351
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,503
I know.

352
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:23,139
I don't know whether it's just
because we're breaking up or what...

353
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,391
...but you have never
looked so beautiful.

354
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,101
Really?

355
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,425
-Pheebs?
-Yeah.

356
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,395
He looks so tiny.

357
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,815
-We just got the message.
-Is he all right?

358
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,359
Yeah, the doctor got the K out.

359
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,321
He also found an M and an O.

360
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,075
We think he was trying
to spell out "monkey."

361
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,877
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.

362
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,339
So you feel like a dad yet?

363
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,341
No. Why?

364
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,345
Hey, come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.

365
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,055
That is very dad.

366
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,765
Oh, look, he's waking up.

367
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,559
ROSS:
Hey, fella. How you doing?

368
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,674
ALL:
Ooh.
