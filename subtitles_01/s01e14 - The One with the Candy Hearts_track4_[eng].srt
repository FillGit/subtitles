1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,464
I'm telling you, Ross, she wants you.

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,467
She barely knows me.
We just live in the same building.

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:11,053
-Any contact?
-She lent me an egg once.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,471
You're in.

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,098
Oh, right.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,601
-Hey, Ross.
-Hey.

7
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,901
Come on, Ross. You gotta get back
in the game here.

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:30,280
The Rachel thing's not happening,
your ex-wife's a lesbian, you....

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,116
I don't think we need a third.

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,578
Excuse me. Could we get an egg
over here, still in the shell?

11
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:37,829
An egg?

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,960
Yeah. Go up to her and say, "Here's your
egg back. I'm returning your egg."

13
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,170
I think it's winning.

14
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,257
-I think it's insane.
-She'll love it.

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,427
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Here.

16
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,516
Go with the egg, my friend.

17
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,312
JOEY & CHANDLER:
Go, go, go.

18
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,567
-Think it'll work?
-It's suicide. The man's got an egg.

19
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,120
MONICA: You cannot do this.
RACHEL: What? Do what?

20
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,913
Roger wants to take her out.

21
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,167
No. Pheebs. Don't you remember
why you dumped the guy?

22
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,336
Because he was creepy.

23
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,255
And mean. And a little frightening.

24
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,050
Still, it's nice to have
a date on Valentine's Day.

25
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,260
-Hi.
-Hi.

26
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,138
You can go out with a creep
any night of the year.

27
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,098
I know I do.

28
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,601
-Hi.
-Hi.

29
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,270
What are you doing tomorrow night?

30
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,814
Actually, tomorrow night
depends on how tonight goes.

31
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:32,194
-Oh. Uh, listen, about tonight-
-No, no, don't you dare bail on me.

32
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,906
She's only going out with me because
I'm bringing a friend for her friend.

33
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,991
But her friend sounds like such a—

34
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,452
Pathetic mess. I know, but....

35
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,247
Come on, man, she's needy,
she's vulnerable. I'm thinking:

36
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,254
Thanks.

37
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:56,009
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

38
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,136
-Hi.
-Hi.

39
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,305
-She said yes.
-Ahem.

40
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,890
Yes! Way to go, man.

41
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,144
CHANDLER: Still got the egg, huh?
-Yeah.

42
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,910
-How do I look?
-Oh, um...

43
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,453
...I don't care.

44
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,583
There's Lorraine.

45
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,585
Now, remember, no trading.

46
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,130
You get the pretty one.
I get the mess.

47
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,882
-Hi, Joey.
-Hey.

48
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,678
Well, well.

49
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,513
Look what you brought.

50
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,223
Very nice.

51
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,226
And what did you bring?

52
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,646
She's checking her coat.

53
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,191
Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell
off of my hands.

54
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:57,237
Will you get me a white zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice?

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,993
Janice?

56
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,413
Janice?

57
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,957
Oh...

58
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,417
...my...

59
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,877
...God.

60
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,175
Hey, it's Janice.

61
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,767
Okay, I'm making a break for it.
I'm going out the window.

62
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:31,646
No, don't, please. I've been waiting
for forever to go out with Lorraine.

63
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,065
-Just calm down.
-Calm down? Calm down?

64
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,110
You set me up with a woman I've dumped
twice in the last five months.

65
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,695
Hey.

66
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:43,158
Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous...

67
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,747
...and I can't go when I'm nervous.

68
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,458
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

69
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,548
Come on! Do it, do it, do it!
Come on!

70
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,970
Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was
nothing compared to Pete Carney.

71
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,097
-Which one was he?
-Pete the Weeper?

72
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,018
Remember the guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

73
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,021
"Oh, was it good for you?"

74
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,402
Well, I'd take a little crying
any day over Howard, the "I win" guy.

75
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,696
"I win. I win."

76
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,493
I went out with him for two months.
I didn't get to win once.

77
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,497
How do we end up with these jerks?
We're good people.

78
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,583
I don't know. I think we're like
some kind of magnets.

79
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,337
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digital watch.

80
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,217
There's more beer, right?

81
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,472
Oh. You know my friend Abby
who shaves her head?

82
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,768
She says to break the
bad-boyfriend cycle...

83
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,312
...you can do a cleansing ritual.

84
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,652
Pheebs, this woman
is voluntarily bald.

85
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,530
Yeah.

86
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,741
So we can do it
tomorrow night, you guys.

87
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,827
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.

88
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,454
Okay, well, what kind of ritual?

89
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,750
Okay, we can, um, burn the stuff
they gave us.

90
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,295
Or...?

91
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:23,341
Or we can chant and dance around naked,
you know, with sticks.

92
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,679
-Burning's good.
-Burning's good.

93
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,472
RACHEL:
I've got stuff to burn.

94
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,566
You know...

95
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:44,195
...ever since I was little, I've been
able to pick up quarters with my toes.

96
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,073
Yeah? Good for you.

97
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:53,121
Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?

98
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:02,422
By the way, Chandler,
I cut you out of all of my pictures.

99
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,134
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

100
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,179
That's okay.

101
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,600
Are you sure? Because you
could make little puppets out of them.

102
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,354
And you could use them in your
Theater of Cruelty.

103
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,608
We can't do that.

104
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,861
What? What can't you do?

105
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,325
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?

106
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,584
Uh, we might be leaving now.

107
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,379
Tell me it's you and me "we."

108
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,884
She said she wants to slather my body
with stuff and then lick it off.

109
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,804
I'm not even sure what slathering is.

110
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,932
But I definitely want to be
a part of it.

111
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,019
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

112
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,731
You're right. I'm sorry.
You're right.

113
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,236
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses
to go, please?

114
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,405
I'm out of here.

115
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,535
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.

116
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,371
I hope she throws up on you.

117
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,874
Thanks.

118
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,963
-So....
-Just us.

119
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,632
Ugh, what a crappy night.

120
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:32,095
Although I have enjoyed the fact that
your shirt's been sticking out...

121
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,223
...of your zipper since you
came back from the bathroom.

122
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,479
Excuse me.

123
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,276
How you doing?

124
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,118
So do we have the best friends,
or what?

125
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,704
Joey's not a friend. He's...

126
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,959
...a stupid man who left us
his credit card.

127
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,089
Another drink? Some dessert?
A big-screen TV?

128
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,924
I will go for that drink.

129
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,718
You got it. Good woman.

130
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,642
A bottle of your
most overpriced champagne.

131
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,519
-Each.
-That's right. Each.

132
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,688
Oh. And a, uh, Rob Roy.

133
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,524
I've always wanted to know.

134
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,505
Happy Valentine's Day.

135
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,890
Oh, I miss you already.

136
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,976
Can you believe this happened?

137
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,686
No, no.

138
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,606
And yet it did.

139
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,776
-Goodbye, Janice.
-Kiss me.

140
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,988
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

141
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,534
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

142
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,871
-Hey, Janice.
-Hi, Monica.

143
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,999
Okay. Well, this was very special.

144
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,128
Rach, come see who's out here.

145
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,507
What's going on-?
Oh, my God.

146
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,884
Janice. Hi.

147
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,054
Janice is gonna go away now.

148
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,057
I'll be right back.

149
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,270
Oh. Joey. Look who it is.

150
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,105
Whoa.

151
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,984
Oh, good. Joey's home now.

152
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,570
This is so much fun.

153
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,155
This is like a reunion in the hall.

154
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,036
Hi, Ross. There's someone
I want you to say hi to.

155
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,748
He just happened to call.

156
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,419
Hello, Ross. Yes, that's right.
It's me. How did you know?

157
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:20,305
I'm just saying if dogs
do experience jet lag, then...

158
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,851
...because of the whole seven-dog-
years-to-one-human-year thing...

159
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,396
...that when a dog flies
from New York to Los Angeles...

160
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,775
...he doesn't just lose three hours,
he loses, like, a week and a half.

161
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,781
-That's funny.
-Yeah.

162
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,711
What?

163
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,257
Who are they?

164
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,760
The, uh, blond is my ex-wife.

165
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,055
And the woman touching her is her...

166
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,474
...close personal friend.

167
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,770
You mean they're lovers?

168
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,105
If you want to put a label on it.

169
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,400
Wow. Hen.

170
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,487
-Anything else I should know?
-Nope. That's it.

171
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,366
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

172
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,413
I always forget that part.

173
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,625
Hello.

174
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:42,095
Okay. So now we need, um,
sage branches and the sacramental wine.

175
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,474
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

176
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,518
Um, that's okay.

177
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,981
RACHEL: Ooh.
-Okay.

178
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,943
All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

179
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,784
Huh. Okay, Pheebs, if we had that...

180
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,161
...we wouldn't be doing the ritual
in the first place.

181
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,333
-Can we start throwing things in?
-Um, yeah, okay.

182
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,211
Oh. Okay. Urn....

183
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,588
Okay. Barry's letters.

184
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,634
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

185
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,137
And I have the receipt
from my dinner with:

186
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,354
-A picture of Scotty Jared, naked.
-Let me see.

187
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,189
He's wearing a sweater.

188
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,400
-No.
RACHEL & PHOEBE: Ew!

189
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,907
Okay, and here we have
the last of Paolo's grappa.

190
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,659
Wait. Isn't it almost pure-?

191
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,709
How can I dump this woman
on Valentine's Day?

192
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,920
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

193
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,968
Oh, man. In my next life
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

194
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,306
Hello, funny valentine.

195
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,059
Hi, just Janice.

196
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,520
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

197
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,607
I could just kiss you all over,
and I'm gonna.

198
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,903
Oh. Okay, heh. Ha, ha, okay.

199
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,323
If you don't do it, I will.

200
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,380
So, um, what do you do for a living?

201
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,924
Well, um for the past few years-

202
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,178
Oh, no. You said they could
shoot the spot without you.

203
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,429
SUSAN:
I thought they could.

204
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,933
-working with children,
which is really fulfilling.

205
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,395
I'll try to get back
as soon as I can. I'm sorry.

206
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,940
KRISTEN: So I'm spending most
of my time teaching science, heh...

207
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,944
...which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

208
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,958
Now, that is funny.

209
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,504
Hey, do you think-?

210
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,716
Would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us?

211
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,052
Because she's alone now.

212
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,388
And pregnant. And sad.

213
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,015
-I guess.
-Are you sure?

214
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,684
Thanks. Carol.

215
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,186
Wanna come over and join us?

216
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,646
Oh, no. I'm fine.

217
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,983
Come on, stand up. These people
will scooch down. Come on.

218
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,403
Come over here.
You guys will scooch, won't you?

219
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,656
Let's try scooching. Come on.

220
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,992
ROSS: Come on.
CAROL: Thank you.

221
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,205
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willet.

222
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,916
-Carol, Kristen.
-How do you do?

223
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,419
Um- Oh, uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.

224
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,172
And, uh, Kristen....

225
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,844
Kristen does something...

226
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,097
...that, funnily enough...

227
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,392
...wasn't even her major.

228
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,190
FIREMAN 1:
What do we got there?

229
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,443
A piece of silk boxer shorts...

230
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,695
...some greeting cards...

231
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,365
...what looks like a
half-charred picture of....

232
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,535
Wow, that guy's hairier
than the chief.

233
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,501
You know, it's a really funny story
how this happened.

234
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,502
It's all right. Don't explain.

235
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,839
It's not the first boyfriend bonfire
we've seen get out of control.

236
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,844
-You're our third call tonight.
-Really?

237
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,181
Sure. Valentine's is our
busiest night of the year.

238
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,228
I brought you something.

239
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,938
Is it loaded?

240
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,236
Oh, little candy hearts.

241
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,281
"Chan and Jan forever."

242
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,825
I had them made special.

243
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,872
Okay, Janice.

244
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:21,999
Janice.

245
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:24,752
Hey, Janice.

246
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,216
Look, there's no way for me
to tell you this.

247
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,010
At least, there's no new way
for me to tell you this.

248
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,933
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

249
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:42,853
That's fine.

250
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,359
-It is?
-Mm-hm.

251
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,196
Because I know that this
isn't the end.

252
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,742
Oh, no. You see, actually, it is.

253
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,829
No, it isn't. Because you
won't let that happen.

254
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,539
Don't you know it yet?

255
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,959
You love me, Chandler Bing.

256
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,756
Oh, no, I don't.

257
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,260
Then why do you think
we keep ending up together?

258
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,345
New Year's, who invited who?

259
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,473
Valentine's, who asked who
into whose bed?

260
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,143
-I did, but-
-You seek me out.

261
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:27,523
Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn.

262
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,652
Janice. Janice.

263
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,238
You want me. You need me.

264
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,700
You can't live without me.

265
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,577
And you know it.

266
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,831
You just don't know you know it.

267
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,337
See you.

268
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,511
Call me.

269
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:10,107
It's not true. I never called
your mother a wolverine.

270
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,860
You did so. I swear.
I swear to-

271
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,158
How long has she been in the bathroom?

272
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:23,245
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom.
Her coat is gone.

273
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,581
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

274
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,170
Maybe I screwed up the first date
I had in nine years.

275
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,923
-That could be it.
-Oh, God.

276
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,635
You know, this is still pretty hot.

277
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,474
Mushroom.

278
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,018
Smile.

279
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:50,981
They won't all be like this.
Some might even stay through dinner.

280
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,485
-I'm sorry. That's not funny.
-No, it's just....

281
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:58,739
Well, you know the whole
getting-on-with-your-life thing?

282
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,033
Well, do I have to?

283
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:06,330
I mean, well, I'm sitting here
with this cute woman...

284
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,624
...and she's perfectly nice,
you know?

285
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,751
But there's....

286
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,170
That's it.

287
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:19,135
And, uh, then I'm here talking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

288
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,846
And I don't have to....

289
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,848
-I know.
-You know?

290
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:31,147
Here's a wacky thought. Um, ahem.

291
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:35,109
-Let's say you and I give it another shot.
-Ross.

292
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,570
No, no, I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.

293
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,577
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now, you know?

294
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,329
Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?

295
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,458
Because we're great together,
you know?

296
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,752
You can't deny it.

297
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,172
And besides, you're carrying my baby.

298
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,175
-I mean, how perfect is that?
-Ross....

299
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,344
You keep saying that,
but there's something right here.

300
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,554
I love you.

301
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,606
I love you too.

302
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,942
-But-
-No "but." No "but."

303
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,114
You know that thing
we put over here with the pin in it?

304
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,620
It's time to take the pin out.

305
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,459
Yeah.

306
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:38,005
You'll find someone. I know you will.
The right woman is waiting for you.

307
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,091
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.

308
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,472
All you need is a woman who likes men
and you'll be set.

309
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,936
Not her.

310
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,491
We get off around midnight.
Why don't we pick you up then?

311
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,368
RACHEL: Okay.
MONICA: Great.

312
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,704
So, um, will you bring the truck?

313
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,709
-I'll even let you ring the bell.
