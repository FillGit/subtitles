1
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:10,511
This is unbelievable.
It's been half an hour.

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,223
If this was a cartoon, you'd be
looking like a ham right about now.

3
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,350
There's the waitress.
Excuse me, miss.

4
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,019
JOEY: Hello, miss?
-It's Phoebe.

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,939
CHANDLER: Hi.
-Hi.

6
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,649
Okay, will that be all?

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,818
Wait, wait.
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,320
Yeah, um, I was over there...

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,198
...then you said, "Excuse me, miss."
So now I'm here.

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,201
No, no. How come you're working here?

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,539
Right. Because it's close to where I live,
and the aprons are really cute.

12
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,123
Can we start over?

13
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,793
-Yeah. Okay, great. I'll be over here.
-No, no, no, no.

14
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,971
I don't know whether he's testing me
or just acting out...

15
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,807
...but my monkey is out of control.

16
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:44,021
He keeps erasing
the messages on my machine.

17
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,523
Supposedly by accident.

18
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,859
Oh, yeah, I've done that.

19
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:55,741
And three days in a row, he got
to the newspaper before I did...

20
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,201
...and peed all over the crossword.

21
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,829
I've never done that.

22
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:05,000
Now tell me she doesn't look
exactly like her sister.

23
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,628
I'm saying I see a difference.

24
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,046
They're twins.

25
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,841
I don't care.
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot.

26
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,179
You know that thing
when we talk about things?

27
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,890
-Let's not do that anymore.
-Okay.

28
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,100
ROSS: Hey, guys.
ALL: Hey.

29
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,561
Hey, Pheebs.
Guess who we saw today.

30
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,396
Ooh. Oh, fun. Okay.

31
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,273
-Um, Liam Neeson.
-No.

32
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,941
-Morley Safer.
JOEY: Nope.

33
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,818
-The woman who cuts my hair.
JOEY: No.

34
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,112
Look, this could be a really long game.

35
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,572
Your sister, Ursula.

36
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,240
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

37
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,201
She works at that place, uh....

38
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,535
Riff's. Yeah, I know.

39
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,538
Oh, you do? She said you guys
haven't talked in years.

40
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,165
Hmm? Yeah.

41
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,920
So, um, is she fat?

42
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,299
Not from where I was standing.

43
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,301
Where were you standing?

44
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,224
Uh, Pheebs, so you guys
just don't get along?

45
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,352
It's mostly just dumb
sister stuff, you know?

46
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,772
Everyone always thought of her
as the pretty one.

47
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,359
Oh. Oh. She was the first to walk...

48
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,487
...even though I did it
later that same day.

49
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,992
To my parents, by then it was,
"Yeah, what else is new?"

50
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,452
ROSS:
Oh.

51
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,622
Pheebs, I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
I've got Lamaze class.

52
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,126
Oh, and I've got earth science,
but I'll catch you in gym?

53
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,339
So is this just gonna be you and Carol?

54
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,258
No. Susan will be there too.

55
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:40,804
We've got dads. We've got lesbians.
The whole parenting team.

56
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,181
Well, isn't that gonna be weird?

57
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,517
No. It might have been at first...

58
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,311
...but now I'm comfortable
with the situation.

59
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,814
-Ross, that's my jacket.
-I know.

60
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,241
Hi. We're the Rostens.

61
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,202
I'm J.C. and he's Michael.

62
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,456
And we're having a boy and a girl.

63
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,834
Good for you.
Alrighty, next?

64
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,504
Hi. Um, I'm, uh-Ahem.

65
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,089
I'm Ross Geller.

66
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,592
And, uh, that's my boy in there.

67
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:23,555
And, uh, this is Carol Willick,
and this is Susan Bunch.

68
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,184
Susan is, um, Carol's....

69
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,399
Who's next?

70
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,819
I'm sorry, Susan is...?

71
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,197
-Susan is Carol's friend.
-Life partner.

72
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,115
Like buddies.

73
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,326
Like lovers.

74
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,495
You know how close women can get.

75
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,290
-Susan and I live together.
-I was married to her.

76
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,210
-Carol. Not me.
-It's a little complicated.

77
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,795
-But we're fine.
-Absolutely.

78
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,173
So, twins. Ha.

79
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,758
That's like two births.

80
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,513
Ouch.

81
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,562
-to you too, Helen.

82
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,941
HELEN :
<i>Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.</i>

83
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,193
Oh. Okay, send her in.

84
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,740
Hi.

85
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,201
-Hi, Nina. Come on in.
-You wanted to see me?

86
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,079
Uh, yes.
Uh, I was just going over your data.

87
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,748
You've been postdating
your Friday numbers.

88
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,000
Which is bad, because...?

89
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,086
-Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
-Ha, ha.

90
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,296
Excuse me?

91
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,215
WENUS. Ahem.

92
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,634
-Weekly Estimated-
-Oh, Net Usage Statistics.

93
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,719
Right. Gotcha, gotcha.

94
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,849
Won't happen again. I wouldn't
want to do anything to hurt your...

95
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,183
...WENUS.

96
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,072
It's not just that she's cute, okay?
It's just that...

97
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,575
...she's really, really cute.

98
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:11,162
It doesn't matter. You don't dip
your pen in the company ink.

99
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,125
Ross.

100
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,836
Your little creature's
got the remote again.

101
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,673
Marcel. Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

102
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,175
Marcel.

103
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,680
Marcel, you give Rossy
the remote right now.

104
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,310
You give Rossy the remote-

105
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,439
-Great.
-Relax. I'll fix it.

106
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:44,738
Oh, cool. Urkel in Spanish is Urkel.

107
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,909
How did he do this?

108
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,203
So tell me,
is leaving the Christmas lights up...

109
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,998
...part of your plan to keep us merry
all year long?

110
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,418
No, someone was supposed to take
them down around New Year's...

111
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,420
...but obviously someone forgot.

112
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,340
Well, someone was supposed to write:

113
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,469
"Rach, take down the lights,"
and put it on the refrigera-

114
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,640
How long has that been there?

115
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,225
Hey, where you been?

116
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,355
I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula
likes me. All I ordered was coffee.

117
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,275
She brought me a tuna melt
and four plates of curly fries.

118
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,612
Score.

119
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,783
She is so hot.

120
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,535
Listen, okay, before you do
anything Joey-like...

121
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,038
...you might want to run it by, uh....

122
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,832
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

123
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,126
-Pheebs?
-Yeah?

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,837
Would it be okay
if I asked out your sister?

125
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,257
Why? Why would you
want to do that? Why?

126
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,512
So that if we went out on a date,
she'd be there.

127
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,895
Well, I mean, I'm not
my sister's, you know...

128
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,272
...whatever. And, urn....

129
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,443
I mean, it's true,
we were one egg once.

130
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,780
But, you know,
we've grown apart, so, urn....

131
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,740
I don't know. Why not?

132
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,367
Cool. Thanks.

133
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,247
You okay?

134
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,999
Yeah, I'm fine.

135
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,793
Do you wanna watch
<i>Laverne y Shirley?</i>

136
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,810
Sorry.

137
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,311
-Hi.
-Hi.

138
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,814
Sorry I'm late.
Uh, where's Carol?

139
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,234
Stuck at school.
Some parent-teacher thing.

140
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,112
You can go.
I'll get the information.

141
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:54,534
No, no, ahem, I think I should stay.
We should both know what's going on.

142
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:55,952
Oh, good.

143
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,620
This will be fun.

144
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:02,333
Alrighty. We're gonna start with some basic
third-stage breathing exercises.

145
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,294
Mommies, get on your back.

146
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,423
And, coaches, you should be
supporting Mommy's head.

147
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,389
-What?
-What?

148
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,349
I'm supposed to be the mommy?

149
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,978
Okay, I'm gonna play
my sperm card one more time.

150
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,692
I don't see why I have to miss out on the
coaching training because I'm a woman.

151
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,694
I see. So, what do you propose to do?

152
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,197
-I'll flip you for it.
-Flip me for it? No, no, no.

153
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,948
Heads, heads, heads.

154
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,618
On your back, Mom.

155
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:44,709
All right, mommies,
take a nice, deep, cleansing breath.

156
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,172
Good.

157
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,300
Now imagine your vagina is opening...

158
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,511
...like a flower.

159
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,315
Mr. Dee. How's it going, sir?

160
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,817
Uh, it's been better.

161
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,903
The Annual Net Usage
Statistics are in.

162
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,739
-And?
-It's pretty ugly.

163
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,284
We haven't seen an ANUS
this bad since the 70s.

164
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,206
-So, what does this mean?
-We're gonna be laying off people.

165
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:27,418
Listen, I know I came in late last week.
I slept funny and my hair was snarly.

166
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,920
Not you.

167
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,797
Relax.

168
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,551
Ever have to fire anyone?

169
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,137
CHANDLER:
Nina....

170
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,431
Nina.

171
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,768
Nina.

172
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,688
Nina....

173
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,232
Are you okay?

174
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,818
Yes. Yes, I am.

175
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:57,699
Uh, listen, the reason that
I called you in here today was, uh....

176
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,784
Please don't hate me.

177
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,452
What?

178
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,999
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

179
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,756
So, Pheebs, what do you want
for your birthday?

180
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:18,469
Well, what I really want is for my mom
to be alive and enjoy it with me.

181
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,391
Okay.

182
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,729
Let me put it this way.
Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?

183
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,857
-Bath salts would be nice.
-Oh, okay. Good.

184
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,117
What is this place?

185
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,037
Look, you're cold, I have to pee,
and there's coffee.

186
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,080
How bad could it be?

187
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,374
I think we have an answer.

188
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,294
What's she doing here?

189
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,839
This could be God's way
of telling us to eat at home.

190
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:59,385
-Think she got fired at Riffs?
-No, we were there last night.

191
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,263
She kept bringing swordfish.
Are you gonna go...?

192
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,682
I'll wait until we order.
It's her, right?

193
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,643
It looks like her.

194
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,437
-Um, excuse me?
-Yeah?

195
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,606
Hi, it's us.

196
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,570
Right. And it's me.

197
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,616
So you're here too?

198
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,826
As much as you are.

199
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,495
Your turn.

200
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,040
-We know what we want.
-Oh, that's good.

201
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,835
-All we want is two caffe lattes.
-And some biscotti cookies.

202
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,671
Good choice.

203
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,510
-It's definitely her.
-Yeah.

204
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,604
I can't believe you.

205
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,941
You still haven't told that girl
she doesn't have a job yet?

206
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,653
Well, you still haven't taken down
the Christmas lights.

207
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,366
Congratulations. I think you found
the world's thinnest argument.

208
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,994
I'm just trying to find the right moment.

209
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,288
Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard,
now that you're dating.

210
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:15,044
"Sweetheart, you're fired. But how
about a quickie before I go to work?"

211
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,799
-Hey.
-Hey.

212
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,972
Once you're inside,
you don't have to knock anymore.

213
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,683
I'll get it.

214
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,896
Oh. Hi, Mr. Heckles.

215
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,523
You're doing it again.

216
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,233
We're not doing anything.

217
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,570
We're just sitting around
talking quietly.

218
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,864
I can hear you through the ceiling.

219
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,826
My cats can't sleep.

220
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,246
You don't even have cats.

221
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,373
I could have cats.

222
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,126
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

223
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,879
We'll try to keep it down.

224
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,761
Phoebe, can you do me a favor?

225
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,013
Try this on to make sure it fits.

226
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:11,142
Oh, my first birthday present.
Oh, this is really-

227
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,604
Oh, no, no. It's for Ursula.
I just figured, you know, size-wise.

228
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,900
Oh. Sure. Yeah.

229
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,485
Okay, it fits.

230
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,491
-Are you seeing her again tonight?
-Yep, Ice Capades.

231
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:27,950
Wow, this is serious.

232
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,454
I've never known you to pay money
for any kind of capade.

233
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,458
I don't know. I like her.

234
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,045
She's different.
There's, uh, something about her-

235
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,547
That you like.
We get it. You like her. Great.

236
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,094
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you,
and you said it was okay.

237
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,221
Well, maybe now it's not okay.

238
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,806
Okay.

239
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,059
Well, maybe now I'm not okay
with it not being okay.

240
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,393
Okay.

241
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,317
Knit, good woman.
Knit. Knit.

242
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,457
And that's the Chrysler Building
right there.

243
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,834
NINA:
Oh.

244
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,878
-Nina.
-Mr. Douglas.

245
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,421
Cool tie.

246
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,926
She's still here.

247
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,846
Yes. Yes, she is.

248
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,639
Didn't I memo you on this?

249
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:36,769
See, after I let her go, uh, I got a call
from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen...

250
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,563
...Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.

251
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,026
And, uh, he informed me that
she took the news rather badly.

252
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,988
In fact, he, uh, mentioned
the word "frenzy."

253
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,282
You're kidding. She seems so-

254
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,950
Oh, no, no. Nina? She's:

255
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,496
In fact, if you asked her now...

256
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,624
...she'd have no recollection
of being fired at all.

257
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,085
That's unbelievable.

258
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,962
And yet believable.

259
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,715
So I decided not to fire her again...

260
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,302
...until I'm sure she will be
of no threat to herself or others.

261
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:14,473
I see. Hmm. You never really know
what's going on inside a person's head.

262
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,644
Well, I guess that's why
they call it psychology, sir.

263
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,484
NARRATOR :
<i>The sound Mom and Dad will never forget.</i>

264
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,945
<i>For this, after all,
is the miracle of birth.</i>

265
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,489
TEACHER:
Lights, please.

266
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,199
And that's having a baby.

267
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,659
Next week is our final class.

268
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,787
Susan, go deep.

269
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,086
CAROL:
It's impossible. It's just impossible.

270
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,379
What is, honey?

271
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,465
What that woman...

272
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,716
...did.

273
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,428
I am not doing that. Heh.

274
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,806
It'll have to stay in, that's all.
Everything will be the same.

275
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,060
-It'll just stay in. Ha, ha.
-Carol, honey. Shh.

276
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,938
-Everything will be all right.
-What do you know?

277
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,982
No one's saying to you,
"Hi, is that your nostril?

278
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,735
Mind if we push
this pot roast through it?"

279
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,571
Carol, sweetie.

280
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,240
Cleansing breath.

281
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,661
I know it's frightening.
But big picture:

282
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,288
The birth part is just one day...

283
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,876
...and when it's over, we'll all
be parents for the rest of our lives.

284
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,046
SUSAN: I mean, that's what
this is all about, right?

285
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,339
Ross?

286
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,508
Ross.

287
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,261
I'm gonna be a father.

288
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,723
-This is just occurring to you?
-I always knew I was having a baby.

289
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,227
I just never realized
the baby was having me.

290
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,562
Oh, you're gonna be great.

291
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,189
How could you say that?

292
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,526
I can't even get Marcel
to stop eating the bathmat.

293
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,611
How will I raise a kid?

294
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,364
You know, Ross, some scientists
are now saying...

295
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,659
...that monkeys and babies
are actually different.

296
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,247
-Where are you going?
-Out.

297
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,915
With...?

298
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,375
Yes.

299
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,794
All right, can I just ask you one question?

300
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,257
Have you two, you know,
like, you know?

301
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,968
You know?

302
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,970
Yet?

303
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,806
Well, not that it's any
of your business...

304
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,766
...but no, we haven't, okay?

305
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,566
You meant sex, right?

306
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,869
-Do you have a sec?
-Uh, sure, Nina. What's up?

307
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,664
I don't know. For the past couple days,
people have been avoiding me...

308
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,833
...and giving me
these really strange looks.

309
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,961
Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because...

310
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,256
...they're, uh, jealous of us.

311
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,966
Maybe.

312
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,345
But that doesn't explain why
they keep taking my scissors.

313
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,099
Uh, well, maybe that's, uh,
because you're getting a big raise.

314
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,561
-I am?
-Sure. Why not?

315
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,814
Oh, my God. You're amazing.

316
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,317
Oh, you don't know.

317
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,613
Helen, make sure we put through the
paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise.

318
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,909
HELEN : <i>Still want her
psychological profile sent to personnel?</i>

319
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,995
-What?
-Helen drinks.

320
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,498
Will you marry me?

321
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,924
-Well, I ended up telling her everything.
-Ooh. How'd she take it?

322
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,219
Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.

323
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,722
Little tip. If you're ever
in a similar situation...

324
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,684
...never, ever leave
your hand on the desk.

325
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,854
Okay, I think I get how to do this.

326
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,779
Can we turn this off?
Can we make them go away?

327
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,864
Because I can't watch.

328
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,950
-Okay, Pheebs, they're gone.
-Okay.

329
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,411
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

330
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,540
It's just, you know,
this whole stupid Ursula thing.

331
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,333
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask...?

332
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,837
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

333
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,422
Um, yeah.

334
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,343
I mean, I'm not saying
she's evil or anything.

335
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,430
She's just, you know,
always breaking my stuff.

336
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,642
When I was 8, I wouldn't let her
have my Judy Jetson Thermos...

337
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,894
...so she threw it under the bus.

338
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,605
And then there's Randy Brown...

339
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,274
...who was like....

340
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,652
Have you ever had a boyfriend
who was like your best friend?

341
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,863
-No.
-No.

342
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,908
Well, but that's what he was for me.

343
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,619
And she, you know,
kind of stole him away...

344
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,706
...and then broke his heart.

345
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,168
And then he wouldn't
even talk to me anymore.

346
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:56,672
He didn't want to be around anything
that looked like either one of us.

347
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,176
Oh, Pheebs.

348
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,764
I mean, I know Joey's not
my boyfriend or my Thermos...

349
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,266
...or anything, but....

350
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,269
-You won't lose him.
-You gotta talk to Joey.

351
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,812
Yeah, okay.

352
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,149
Come on. He doesn't know this stuff.
If he knew how you felt....

353
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,984
He's falling in love with her.

354
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,195
Oh, please.
They've been going out a week.

355
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:23,741
They haven't even slept together yet.
I mean, that's not serious.

356
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,245
Okay.

357
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,707
Oh. Okay. Oh.

358
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:48,974
Oh.

359
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,728
Yeah, um, may we help you?

360
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,788
Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing.
Would you come inside?

361
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,831
No, no, no.

362
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,751
You wanted me to take them down...

363
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,546
...so I'm taking them down, okay?

364
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,799
Rachel!

365
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,259
Rachel!

366
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,553
I'm okay. I'm okay.

367
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,930
Mr. Heckles?

368
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,600
Mr. Heckles,
could you help me, please?

369
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,980
See, this is just the kind of thing
I was talking about.
