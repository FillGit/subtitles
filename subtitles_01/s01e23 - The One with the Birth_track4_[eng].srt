1
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,050
WOMAN :
<i>Dr. Johnson, you have a call on line 7.</i>

2
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:11,386
She's not here yet.
She's having my baby and she's not here.

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,473
-Everything's fine. Has her water broken?
-I don't know.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,768
But when I spoke to her, she said
she'd already passed the mucus plug.

5
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,273
Do we have to know about that?

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,817
What are you gonna do
when you have a baby?

7
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,738
I'm gonna be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

8
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:33,867
Yes, Joey's made arrangements
to have his baby in a movie from the '50s.

9
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,122
Aah, I don't believe this. I mean,
she could be giving birth in the cab.

10
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,415
Oh, Ross, relax.

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,751
It's only like $2 for the first contraction...

12
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:46,088
...and then 50 cents
each additional contraction.

13
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,675
What, it's okay when Chandler does it?

14
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,678
You have to pick your moments.

15
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,557
-Hi. Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
-No, she's not even here yet.

16
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,517
-Oh.
MONICA: What's with the guitar?

17
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:02,563
I just thought we might be here for a while,
so, you know, things might get musical.

18
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,733
ROSS: Hey, where the hell have you been?
-We stopped at the gift shop.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,653
I was looking at stuffed animals,
and Susan wanted a Chunky.

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,699
Susan wanted a- You're having a baby.
A baby. You don't stop for Chunkys.

21
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,618
-I used to have that bumper sticker.
-Ha, ha.

22
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,495
You see what I mean?

23
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,796
-"Stopped for a Chunky."
-Let it go, Ross.

24
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,007
I got an extra one. You want this?

25
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,468
No.

26
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,013
Hey, how's my favorite
parenting team doing?

27
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,806
Dr. Franzblau. Hi.

28
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,934
So I understand you're thinking
of having a baby.

29
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,311
Wow.

30
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,064
I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.

31
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,651
-How you doing with your contractions?
-Oh, I love them.

32
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,362
Each one's like a little party in my uterus.

33
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,573
Ha, ha. They're every four minutes
and last 55 seconds.

34
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,825
Fifty-nine seconds. Quartz. Ha.

35
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,370
Swiss quartz. Ha, ha.

36
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,124
-Am I allowed to drink anything?
-Ice chips, just ice chips.

37
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,460
-They're at the nurses' station.
-I'll get them.

38
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,797
SUSAN: No, I'm getting it. Be right back.
-No, I got it. I'm getting it.

39
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,676
Hi. Thought you might like
some ice chips.

40
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,220
CAROL:
Thanks.

41
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,555
And if you need anything else, I...

42
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,641
...do not believe we have met. Hi.

43
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,644
I'm Rachel Green.

44
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:09,106
I'm Carol's ex-husband's
sister's roommate. Ha, ha.

45
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,025
It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau.

46
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,654
I'm your roommate's brother's
ex-wife's obstetrician.

47
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,658
Oh, that's funny.

48
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,457
I want a baby.

49
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,752
Hmm. Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.

50
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,505
Get up. Come on, let's get some coffee.

51
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,050
Oh, okay, because we never do that.

52
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,928
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

53
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,139
Or just fall down. That's good too.

54
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,307
LYDIA: Knickfan?
JOEY: Oh, yeah.

55
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,644
-Oh, boy, do they suck.
-Hey, listen, lady, I-

56
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,146
Whoa.

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,442
Look. Look at your man Ewing.
Nice shot.

58
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,445
You know, he couldn't hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

59
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,113
Oh, yeah? And who do you like?

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,532
-Celtics.
-Celtics? Ha!

61
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,618
They couldn't hit a boat if— Wait.

62
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,539
They suck, all right?

63
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,375
Shut up.
You know, it's a rebuilding year. You-

64
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,877
-Aah! Aah!
-Oh. Aah.

65
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,545
Uh, let me get the father. Hey!

66
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,006
We need a father over here!
We need a father!

67
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,507
There's no father.

68
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,426
Oh. Oh.

69
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,677
Oh, sorry.

70
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,555
Oh, that's okay. I'm fine. I'm-

71
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,432
-Oh!
-Oh, uh-

72
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,100
Okay. All right. Uh, right this way.

73
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,770
All the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

74
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,229
Okay.

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,198
<i>They're tiny and chubby
And so sweet to touch</i>

76
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,035
<i>But soon they'll grow up
And resent you so much</i>

77
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:51,041
<i>Now they're yelling at you
And you don't know why</i>

78
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,170
<i>And you cry and you cry and you cry</i>

79
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,507
<i>And you cry and you cry and you cry</i>

80
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,842
-Thanks, Ross.
-Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.

81
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,178
Okay.

82
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,433
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.

83
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,522
No fair. I don't even have one.
How come they get two?

84
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,483
-You'll get one.
-Oh, yeah? When?

85
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,026
CHANDLER:
I'll tell you what.

86
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,570
When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

87
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,615
...what do you say you and I have one?

88
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,575
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?

89
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,954
Oh, no, no, no.
I just meant hypothetically.

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,123
Okay, hypothetically,
why won't I be married when I'm 40?

91
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,543
-No, no, no.
-No, no, what is it? Seriously.

92
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,212
Is there something
fundamentally unmarriable about me?

93
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,632
-Uh- Uh-
-Well?

94
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,344
Dear God. This parachute is a knapsack.

95
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,515
-Hey.
-Hey. Ooh.

96
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,684
-Look at you, dressy-dress.
-Yeah.

97
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,727
Did you go home and change?

98
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,231
Yeah, well, it's an important day.
I wanna look nice.

99
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,067
Um, has Dr. Franzblau been by?

100
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:01,820
No, I haven't seen him.

101
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,990
Well, where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

102
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,160
What if the baby needs him?

103
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,454
Rachel, what is the deal
with you and doctors?

104
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,625
-Is, like, your father a doctor?
-Yeah. Why?

105
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,836
No reason.

106
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,965
Mom, we've been through this.

107
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,759
No, I am not calling him.

108
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,887
I don't care if it is his kid.
The guy's a jerk.

109
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,975
No, I am not alone. Joey's here.

110
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,644
What do you mean, "Joey who?"

111
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,104
<i>Joey who?</i>

112
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,608
-Tribbiani.
-Joey Tribbiani.

113
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:44,529
Yes. Okay. Hold on.

114
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,073
-She wants to talk to you.
-No.

115
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,034
Take the phone.

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,952
Hi. Yeah, it's me.

117
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,999
Oh, no, no, no. We're just friends. Yeah.

118
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,126
Yeah, I'm single.

119
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,337
Twenty-five.

120
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,755
An actor.

121
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,506
Hello?

122
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,805
-She's not much of a phone person.
-Yeah.

123
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,809
So, uh, what's the deal
with this father guy?

124
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,855
I mean, if someone was having my baby
somewhere, I'd wanna know about it.

125
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:23,234
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood? Um, no.

126
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,323
Okay. Uh, look, maybe I should just go.

127
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,201
-Maybe you should.
-Good luck.

128
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,704
And, uh, take care, huh?

129
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,381
Know what the Celtics' problem is?
They let the players run the team.

130
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,757
Oh, that is so not true.

131
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,717
-Oh, it is. It is.
-It isn't. Isn't.

132
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,428
-Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
-Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

133
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,514
You're gonna kill me!

134
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,476
-Fifteen more seconds. Fourteen, 13, 12-
-Count faster.

135
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,813
It's gonna be okay. We're doing it for Jordy.
Keep focusing on Jordy.

136
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,106
Who the hell is Jordy?

137
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,400
-Your son.
-Whoa, whoa whoa.

138
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,859
I don't have a son named Jordy.

139
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,153
We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.

140
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,115
Well, Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girlfriend...

141
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,575
...so we went back to Jordy.

142
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:13,993
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

143
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,705
What do you mean, "back to Jordy"?
We never landed on Jordy.

144
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:22,127
We just passed by it
during the whole Jesse/Cody/Dillon fiasco.

145
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,378
Ow, ow, ow!

146
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,213
-What? What? What?
-Leg cramp, leg cramp.

147
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,424
ROSS: I got it. I got it.
-I got it. I'm doing it.

148
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,009
You get to sleep with her.
I get the cramps.

149
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,344
No, you don't.

150
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,805
-That is it. I want both of you out.
-What?

151
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,432
-She started it.
-He started it.

152
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,641
I don't care.

153
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,060
I'm trying to get a person
out of my body here...

154
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,689
...and you're not making it any easier.
Now go!

155
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,609
-Thanks a lot.
-See what you did?

156
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,154
-Yeah. Listen—
-Out.

157
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:55,744
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

158
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,704
Oh, no.

159
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,081
Ew.

160
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,668
What is that? Something exploded.

161
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,171
It's just her water breaking.
Calm down, will you?

162
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,716
Water breaking? What do you mean?
What's that, water breaking?

163
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,511
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

164
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,558
-Oh, please. This is so your fault.
-How? How is this my fault?

165
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,686
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room
before you came along.

166
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,482
Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did
before I came along.

167
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,569
-Are you trying to be clever?
-You are so threatened by me.

168
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,781
-Everything I say is a problem.
PHOEBE: Hey, hey, hey. Okay. All right.

169
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,449
That's it. Get in here. Come on.

170
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:38,411
My God, you guys. I don't believe you.

171
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,748
There are children coming into the world
in this very building...

172
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,460
...and your fighting noises are not
the first thing they should be hearing.

173
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,088
So just stop all the yelling! Just stop it!

174
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,715
Yeah, Susan.

175
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:54,594
Don't make me do this again!
I don't like my voice like this!

176
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,227
Okay, who wants to hear
something ironic?

177
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,566
PHOEBE & SUSAN:
Help!

178
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,110
ROSS: Come on!
PHOEBE & SUSAN: Help!

179
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,904
ROSS: I'm having a baby in there!
SUSAN: Hello?

180
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,240
-Help!
ROSS: Okay, everyone stand back.

181
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,787
Ow.

182
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,333
Are they here yet?

183
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,919
No, honey, but don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

184
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,256
And until we do,
we are all here for you, okay?

185
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,841
-Okay. Okay.
RACHEL: Okay?

186
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,511
Anyway, you were telling me about Paris.
It sounds wonderful.

187
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:40,139
It really was. There was this
great little pastry shop right by my hotel-

188
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,602
There you go, dear. You....

189
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,771
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push.

190
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,149
<i>Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder.</i>

191
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,610
<i>Push him out, push him out. Way out.</i>

192
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,613
<i>Let's get that ball and really move.
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.</i>

193
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,865
<i>Let's get-</i>

194
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,244
I was just- Yeah, okay.

195
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,705
Push, push, push.

196
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,418
What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

197
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,382
-Help! Help! Help!
-Help!

198
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,678
<i>And they found their bodies
The very next day</i>

199
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:22,765
<i>And they found their bodies
The very next-</i>

200
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,518
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la</i>

201
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,478
ROSS & SUSAN:
Help!

202
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:32,192
No, Mom, everything's going fine, really.
Yeah, Ross is great. He's, uh....

203
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,946
He's in a whole other place. Yeah.
No, he's gone.

204
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,283
No, no, you don't have to fly back.
Really.

205
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,577
What do you mean,
this might be your only chance?

206
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,121
Oh. Would you stop? I'm only 26.

207
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,123
I'm not even thinking about babies yet.

208
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,349
-Where have you been?
JOEY: Oh, I just had a baby.

209
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,685
Maze I tov.

210
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,983
I don't know.
It could be an hour, it could be three.

211
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,110
But relax, she's doing great.

212
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,865
So, uh, tell me,
are you currently involved with anyone?

213
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,077
No. No, not at-
At the moment, no, I'm not, no.

214
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,037
-Are you?
-No, no.

215
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,081
It's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

216
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,168
Heh. Right, yeah,
I've heard that about cute doctors.

217
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,878
No, no, really.

218
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:38,549
I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know...

219
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,343
...where I do.

220
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,013
-Oh.
-Mm.

221
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,893
I try not to let work affect my personal life,
but it's hard when you do...

222
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,771
...what I do. It's like, uh....

223
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,190
Well, for instance, what do you do?

224
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,985
-I'm a waitress.
-Okay, all right.

225
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,321
Well, aren't there times when you come
home at the end of the day...

226
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,951
...and you're just like,
"If I see one more cup of coffee...."

227
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,833
Ahem. Yeah. Gotcha.

228
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:17,755
-I'm gonna check up on your friend.
-Okay, that's fine.

229
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,392
-So how did you know I was even here?
ROY: Your mom called me.

230
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,728
So is this her?

231
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,646
No, this is a loaner.

232
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,900
Listen, I'm sorry you had to do this
by yourself.

233
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:43,990
Oh. I wasn't by myself.
I had a doctor, a nurse and a helper guy.

234
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,243
So did you see who won the game?

235
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,955
Yeah, Knicks by 10. They suck.

236
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,916
Eh, they're not so bad.

237
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,732
ROSS:
Come on. Come on.

238
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:24,072
Damn it, damn it, damn it.
This is all your fault.

239
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,949
This is supposed to be, like,
the greatest day of my life.

240
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,078
My son is being born,
and I should be in there, you know?

241
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,163
Instead I'm stuck in a closet with you.

242
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,666
I've been waiting for this
just as much as you have.

243
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,003
Believe me, no one has been waiting
for this as much as I have, okay?

244
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,880
And you know what the funny thing is?

245
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,633
When this day is over,
you get to go home with the baby.

246
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,219
-Where does that leave me?
-You get to be the father.

247
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:50,139
Everyone knows who you are. Who am I?
There's Father's Day. There's Mother's Day.

248
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,600
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.

249
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,228
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

250
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,816
This is so great.

251
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,571
You wanna explain that?

252
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,534
I mean, well, because when I was
growing up, you know, my dad left...

253
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,745
...and my mother died,
and my stepfather went to jail.

254
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,666
So I barely had enough pieces of parents
to make one whole one.

255
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,337
And here's this little baby
who has like three whole parents...

256
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:25,258
...who care about it so much that they fight
over who gets to love it the most...

257
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,844
...and it's not even born yet.

258
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,555
It's just the luckiest baby
in the whole world.

259
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,435
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

260
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,021
Where are they?

261
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,191
-I'm sure they'll be here soon.
-They wouldn't miss this.

262
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:47,363
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

263
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,577
Okay, you are really frightening me.

264
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,582
Somebody wanna help me?
Trying to rip out my heart.

265
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,211
Uh- Oh, that's great.
Anybody seen a nipple?

266
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,465
All right. Ten centimeters. Here we go.

267
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,927
-All right, honey, time to start pushing.
-But they're not here yet.

268
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,221
Sorry, I can't tell the baby
to wait for them.

269
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,224
Oh, God.

270
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,229
Okay, got the vent open.

271
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,814
Hi, I'm Ben.

272
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,360
I'm hospital worker Ben.

273
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,362
It's Ben to the rescue.

274
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,948
- <i>La, la, la
</i>-Okay, okay, okay.

275
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,200
-Ben,you ready?
-Yeah.

276
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,035
-All right, give me your foot.
-Okay.

277
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:38,206
-Okay, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Unh.
PHOEBE: Ooh.

278
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,585
-Come on, Ben. Okay. That's it, Ben.
PHOEBE: Okay. Uh-huh.

279
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,462
SUSAN:
What do you see?

280
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,382
PHOEBE: Well, Susan,
I see what appears to be a dark vent.

281
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,884
Wait.

282
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:53,596
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.

283
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,893
Pheebs, it's open! It's open!

284
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,233
Wait! You forgot your legs!

285
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,027
ALL: Push. Push.
-We're here!

286
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,823
ROSS: We're here.
-Where have you been?!

287
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,116
Long story, honey.

288
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,452
FRANZBLAU:
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing.

289
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,412
I need- Excuse me, can I have this?

290
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,248
Oh, sorry.

291
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,666
All right, all right.

292
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,919
There's too many people in this room.
There's about to be one more.

293
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:29,465
So anybody who's not an ex-husband
or a lesbian life partner, out you go.

294
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,342
-Come on, out.
RACHEL: Okay, good luck.

295
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,678
-Bye, bye, bye.
-Good luck, you guys, good luck.

296
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,807
Let me ask you, do you have to be
Carol's lesbian life partner?

297
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,517
NURSE:
Out.

298
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,229
FRANZBLAU: All right.
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.

299
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,232
Let me see. I gotta see, I gotta see.

300
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,067
Oh- Oh.

301
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,320
Oh! A head.

302
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,490
Oh. It's huge.
Carol, how are you doing this?

303
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,827
Not helping.

304
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,954
FRANZBLAU:
You're doing great. You're doing fine.

305
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,123
-Hello?
-Oh, sorry.

306
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,250
What do you see? What do you see?

307
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,961
We got a head, we got shoulders,
we got arms, we got-

308
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,172
Oh, look at the little— The fingers.

309
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,674
Oh, a chest and a stomach...

310
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,760
...and it's a boy, definitely a boy.

311
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,264
All right. Okay, legs, knees and feet.

312
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,515
Oh, oh.

313
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,689
He's here. He's....

314
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,441
He's a person.

315
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,692
Oh!

316
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,861
-Look at that.
-What does he look like?

317
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,032
Kind of like my Uncle Ed,
covered in Jell-O.

318
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,034
Really?

319
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,745
PHOEBE :
You guys, he's beautiful.

320
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,331
Aw, thanks, Pheebs.

321
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:53,674
No shouting,
but we still need a name for this little guy.

322
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,719
How about Ben?

323
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,013
I like Ben.

324
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,349
Ben.

325
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,558
Ben.

326
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,936
-Ha, ha. Ben's good.
-Yeah?

327
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,189
How come you never
mentioned Ben before?

328
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,442
-We, uh, just cooked it up.
SUSAN: Ha, ha.

329
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,779
That's what we were off doing.

330
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,031
-Hi.
-Hey.

331
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,784
-Can we come in?
-Yeah, come in. Come in.

332
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,751
I know. I know.

333
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,754
Everybody,
there's someone I'd like you to meet.

334
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,923
Yeah. This is Ben.

335
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,675
-Hi, Ben.
-Hi, Ben.

336
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,636
-Ben, this is everybody.
-Hey, Ben.

337
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,639
Susan, he looks just like you.

338
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,810
SUSAN:
Thanks. Ha, ha.

339
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,313
Oh, God, I can't believe one of us
actually has one of these.

340
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,982
I know. I still am one of these.

341
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,820
-Ross?
ROSS: Yeah?

342
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,530
Can I?

343
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:03,035
Okay, the head, the head. You gotta....

344
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,376
Hi, Ben. Hi.

345
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,337
I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes, I am.

346
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,257
I'm your Aunt Monica.

347
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,510
I....

348
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,055
I will always have gum.

349
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,270
Ben...

350
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,773
...I want you to know
that there may be some times...

351
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,651
...when I may not be around...

352
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,403
...like this.

353
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,950
But I'll still always come back...

354
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,578
...like this.

355
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,541
And sometimes I may be away longer...

356
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,376
...like this.

357
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,466
But I'll still always come back...

358
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,845
...like this.

359
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:09,018
And sometimes I'll want you to steal third,
and I'll go like this.

360
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,612
Oh, he is so amazing.

361
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,239
Yeah, I know. Look at him.

362
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,158
Ben.

363
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,951
Ben.

364
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,786
Hey, Ben.

365
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,665
Nothing. I don't think that's his name.

366
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,878
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes.

367
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,923
Oh, look, he's opening his eyes.

368
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,552
He doesn't do much, does he?

369
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,555
Nope, this is pretty much it.

370
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,982
-You guys wanna get some coffee?
ALL: Yeah.

371
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,985
All right, I'll see you guys later.

372
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,704
<i>Hi, Ben.</i>

373
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,791
- / <i>love you.
-Hi, Ben.</i>

374
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,563
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
