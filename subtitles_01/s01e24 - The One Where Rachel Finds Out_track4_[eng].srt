1
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:04,796
ROSS:
Here's little Ben nodding off.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,841
Aww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,595
-Look, he's got Ross' haircut.
-Oh, let me see.

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,224
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,477
You must just want
to kiss him all over.

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,483
That would be nice.

7
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,320
-Pfft.
-Pardon?

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,865
Nothing. Just a little extra air
in my mouth. Pfft.

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,165
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here?
I promise I'll pay you back.

10
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,418
Oh, yeah, right.
Including the waffles last week...

11
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,254
...you now owe me...

12
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,631
...17 jillion dollars.

13
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,717
I will, really,
I'll pay you back this time.

14
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,803
Where's the money coming from?

15
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,557
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with some, uh, research.

16
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,433
What kind of research?

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,396
Uh, just, you know, science.

18
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,731
Science.

19
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,986
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

20
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,781
It's a fertility study.

21
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,951
Joey....

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,288
Please tell me you're only
donating your time.

23
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,250
Come on, you guys.
It's not that big a deal.

24
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,211
I just go down there
every other day...

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,505
...and make my contribution
to the project.

26
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,676
Hey, but at the end of two weeks,
I get $700!

27
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,637
Wow, you're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

28
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,233
Okay, we got the coleslaw.
We got the buns.

29
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,613
We've got the ground-up flesh
of formally cute cows and turkeys.

30
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,367
Men are here!

31
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,582
We make fire.

32
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,752
Cook meat.

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,463
Then put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back!

34
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,590
Cute, cute.

35
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,676
-Oh, Melanie called. She's gonna be late.
-Oh, okay.

36
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,553
So how are things going with you two?

37
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,306
Is she becoming your special someone?

38
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,769
I don't know. She's, uh-
She's pretty great.

39
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,189
Yeah? What does she think of
your little science project?

40
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,569
You think I'm gonna tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

41
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,991
The man's got a point.

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,870
Well, the tough thing is,
she really wants to have sex with me.

43
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,289
Crazy bitch.

44
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,881
I still got a week left in the program,
and according to the rules...

45
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,010
...if I want to get the money, I'm not allowed
to conduct any personal experiments...

46
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,848
-...if you know what I mean.
-Joey, we always know what you mean.

47
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,481
PHOEBE: Hey.
ROSS: Hey.

48
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,026
How long did you think
this barbecue was gonna last?

49
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,611
I'm going to China.

50
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,448
Jeez, you say one thing and, eh....

51
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,825
You're going to China?

52
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,786
It's, uh, for the museum.
Someone found a bone.

53
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,122
We want the bone,
they don't want us to have it.

54
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,460
So I'm going to try to persuade therm-
it's a whole big "bone" thing.

55
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,505
Anyway, I'm gonna be gone
for, like, a week.

56
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,801
So, uh, if you wanna reach me,
you can't. So here's my itinerary.

57
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,720
Urn....

58
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,639
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.

59
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:29,394
Could you take it to Carol's now and then
and show it to Ben so he doesn't forget me?

60
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,813
-Yeah.
-Hi, Ben.

61
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,982
I'm your father.

62
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,070
I am The Head! Pahh!

63
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,535
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.

64
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,582
Is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her
a happy birthday before I left.

65
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,002
-Oh, no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
-Oh. Heh.

66
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,962
Hey, who's Carl?

67
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,800
-The guy she met at the coffeehouse?
-No.

68
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,597
-See, there's this guy she met at-
-The coffeehouse? Right.

69
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,934
So you do know who he is. Heh.

70
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,105
I'm gonna go say goodbye
to the guys.

71
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,192
Hey, you know what?
Tell them that bone story.

72
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,406
-Hi.
-Hey.

73
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,616
Hey.

74
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,452
-I have to go to China.
-The country?

75
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,541
No, this big pile of dishes
in my Mom's breakfront.

76
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,086
Do you guys know who Carl is?

77
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,422
Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore....

78
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:40,799
No.

79
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,803
-Well, Rachel's having drinks with him.
-Oh, no!

80
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,556
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

81
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,892
Forget about her.

82
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,146
He's right, man. Please move on.
Go to China. Eat Chinese food.

83
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,191
Of course, there they just call it food.

84
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,279
Yeah? I guess. I don't know.

85
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,408
All right, just give her this
for me, okay?

86
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,451
Listen, we're just looking out for you.

87
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,161
-I know.
-We want you to be happy.

88
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,249
And I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you, man.

89
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,670
I'm still on my first.

90
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,300
I just think you're nice.

91
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,394
Anyway, that's when me and my friends
started this fruit-basket business.

92
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:39,190
We call ourselves
"The Three Basketeers." Ha, ha.

93
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,277
Like "The Three Musketeers,"
only with fruit.

94
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,988
Oh!

95
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,282
Okay.

96
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,162
-How do you like your burgers?
-No. Presents first, food later!

97
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,457
Hold on there, tiger.

98
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,834
How's it going?
How you holding up?

99
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,544
Well, not so good.

100
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,131
She thinks tonight's the night
we're gonna complete the transaction...

101
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,716
...if you know what I—

102
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,384
And you do. Heh.

103
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,221
So, uh, have you ever thought about
being there for her?

104
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,223
What do you mean?

105
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,730
You know, just be there for her.

106
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,942
Not following you.

107
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,156
Think about it.

108
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:38,375
Okay, I'm guessing this is from....

109
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,171
Well, thank you, Melanie.

110
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,966
-Okay, this one right here is from me.
-Okay.

111
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,759
Hmm. Ah, it's light.

112
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,304
It rattles. It's...

113
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,601
-...Travel Scrabble.
-Ha, ha, hey!

114
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,188
Wow. Thank you.

115
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,318
This one's from Joey.

116
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:10,407
It feels like a book. I think it's a book.
Feels like a book. And it's a book!

117
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,409
It's Dr. Seuss!

118
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,829
That book got me through
some tough times.

119
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,375
There is a little child
inside this man.

120
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,503
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die.

121
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,508
-Who's this from?
-That's, uh, Ross'.

122
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,968
Ah.

123
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,558
Oh, my God.

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,893
He remembered.

125
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,311
Remembered what?

126
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,230
It was, like, months ago.

127
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,942
We were walking by this antique store,
and I saw this pin in the window.

128
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,821
I told him it was just like one
my grandmother had when I was little.

129
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,366
Aw! I can't believe he remembered!

130
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,162
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

131
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,252
Oh, it's so pretty.

132
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,422
-This must've cost him a fortune.
-I can't believe he did this.

133
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,966
Ross? Remember when he
fell in love with Carol...

134
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,595
...and bought her that ridiculously
expensive crystal duck?

135
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,556
What did you just say?

136
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,028
Crystal duck.

137
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,534
No, no, no.

138
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,913
The, urn-- The "love" part?

139
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,380
Oh, my God.

140
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,801
Oh, no, no, no, no.

141
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,303
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.

142
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,972
That'll turn back time.

143
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,773
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable.

144
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,651
I know. This is really, really huge.

145
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,322
No, it's not. It's small,
it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.

146
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:19,536
Uh-uh. I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again.

147
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,498
Is there a mute button on this woman?

148
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,126
I think this is so great!
I mean, you and Ross!

149
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,588
-Did you have any idea?
-No, none.

150
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,092
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...

151
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,761
...but nothing ever happened,
so I just....

152
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,139
What else did he say?
Does he want to go out with me?

153
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,517
Given that he's desperately
in love with you...

154
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,812
...he wouldn't mind getting
a cup of coffee or something.

155
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,772
Ross?

156
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,108
All this time?

157
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,694
-I've gotta talk to him.
-He's in China!

158
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,028
The country.

159
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,616
Wait, his flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

160
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,411
What about the time difference?
From here to the airport?

161
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,662
Yes!

162
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,541
-You're never gonna make it!
-I've got to try.

163
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,668
What are you gonna say to him?

164
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,169
I don't know.

165
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,838
CHANDLER:
Maybe you shouldn't go.

166
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,924
Right, because if you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

167
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,760
Yeah, but if it's good news, tell him now.

168
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,470
Maybe I'll know when I see him.

169
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,181
Here, look. All right, does this help?

170
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,023
No.

171
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:34,193
All I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.

172
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,821
I've just got to talk to him. I've got-

173
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,407
-I'll see you later.
-I love you!

174
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,285
Deal with me first!

175
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:55,757
All right.

176
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,888
Ross! Ross.

177
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,181
Excuse me, pardon me.

178
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,849
-Hi. Your boarding pass?
-Hi.

179
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,893
No, I need to talk to my friend.

180
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:11,064
Sorry, you're not allowed on the jetway
unless you have a boarding pass.

181
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,484
He just went on. He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can I just-?

182
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,653
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!

183
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,865
All right, um, then could you please
just give him a message for me?

184
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,617
Please? This is very important.

185
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,161
All right. What's the message?

186
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,872
Uh- I don't know.

187
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,794
Excuse me! Sir!
Excuse me! Sir?

188
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,921
-I have a message for you.
-What?

189
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,008
It's from Rachel. She loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

190
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,927
What?

191
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,056
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

192
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,766
There's no Rachel!

193
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,143
Don't give me that deep freeze!

194
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:02,282
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

195
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,035
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

196
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,163
It was nothing.

197
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,960
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you!

198
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,674
Ann, you know what?

199
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,595
Forget about me. Let's, uh-
Let's give you another turn.

200
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,433
Me, again?

201
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,977
Sure. Why not?

202
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:38,484
Boy! Somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

203
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,202
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like
I thought you would be.

204
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,746
How do you mean?

205
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:54,292
I just had you pegged as one of those
guys who are always, "Me, me, me!"

206
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,044
-Ha, ha.
-But you...

207
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,254
...you're a giver.

208
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,050
You're, like, the most generous
man I ever met.

209
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,720
I mean, you're practically a woman.

210
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,896
So, uh, Rach, do you want to save
this wrapping paper?

211
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,397
It's only a little torn.

212
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,942
Are you gonna go for it with Ross,
or should I throw it out?

213
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,113
I don't know.

214
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,032
I don't know.

215
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,202
Thought about it
all of the way there...

216
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,580
...and I thought about it
all the way back and, uh....

217
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,540
You know, it's Ross!

218
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,043
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

219
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,878
-Sure!
-Sure.

220
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:44,008
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling...

221
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,886
...but I'm thinking...

222
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,055
...it'd be really great.

223
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,850
Oh, my God, me too!
Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law!

224
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,313
The best part is you already
know everything about him.

225
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,649
It's like starting on the 15th date.

226
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,319
But it would be like
starting on the 15th date.

227
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,114
Another good point.

228
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,907
No, I mean....

229
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:12,537
At the 15th date, you're already
in a "relationship-y" place.

230
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,955
You're committed.

231
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,041
Huh.

232
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,836
What happens if it doesn't work out?

233
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,047
-Why isn't it working out?
-I don't know, sometimes it doesn't.

234
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,968
Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?

235
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,345
-No, I'm just-
-Maybe there's someone else.

236
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,223
Is there? Is there someone else?

237
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,601
-No, there is no one else.
-Then why the hell...

238
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,187
-...are you dumping my brother?
-Wha-?

239
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,991
-Hey, big—
-Shh!

240
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,909
Spender.

241
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,746
She's still asleep.

242
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,457
-So how'd it go?
-It was amazing.

243
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,710
You know how you think
you're great in bed?

244
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,589
The fact you'd even ask
shows how little you know me.

245
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,884
Well, it's like,
last night I couldn't do the thing...

246
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,011
...that usually makes me great.

247
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,346
So I had to do all this other stuff.

248
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,600
And the response I got! Man, oh, man.

249
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,977
It was like a ticker-tape parade!

250
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,566
Yes I know. As it happens, my room
is very close to the parade route.

251
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,034
It was amazing, and not just for her.
Uh-uh. For me too.

252
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,329
It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind...

253
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,706
...but all my other senses
are heightened.

254
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:42,543
You know? It's like,
I was able to appreciate it...

255
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,795
...on another level.

256
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,842
I didn't know you had another level.

257
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,178
I know. Neither did I!

258
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,940
-Hey, great skirts! Birthday present?
-Yeah.

259
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,733
-From who?
-From you.

260
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,069
I exchanged the blouse you got me.

261
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,364
Well, it's the thought.

262
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,700
Doesn't Ross' flight get in
in a couple hours?

263
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,744
At gate 27B?

264
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,872
Uh, yeah.

265
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,542
Monica, you know,
I've been thinking about it.

266
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,128
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

267
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,172
-Why?
-Because I feel...

268
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,925
...like I wouldn't
just be going out with him.

269
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,219
I would be going out with all of you.

270
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,014
-Ugh, there'd be all this pressure and-
-No pressure, no pressure!

271
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,811
Nothing has even happened yet
and you're already so-

272
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,354
I'm not "so."

273
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,773
I was a teensy bit weird at first...

274
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,859
...but I'll be good. I promise.

275
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,157
Who is it?

276
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,701
CARL:
<i>It's me, Carl.</i>

277
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,994
Come on up.

278
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,954
Behind my brother's back?

279
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,251
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

280
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,143
-Seven hundred bucks.
-All right, you did it.

281
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,728
Do we have any fruit?

282
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,816
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh?

283
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,028
You know what, though?
I really feel I learned something.

284
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,864
So you'll stick with this
"it's all for her" thing?

285
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,866
What, are you crazy?

286
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:41,454
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around like this?

287
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,296
I'm just saying, if I see one more
picture of Ed Begley Jr...

288
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,548
...in that stupid electric car...

289
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,258
...I'm gonna shoot myself!

290
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:00,222
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against
environmental issues, per se...

291
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,183
...it's just that guy!

292
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,604
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

293
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,024
Excuse me, please.
I'm trying to have a date here.

294
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,693
Fine, just stop thinking about me.

295
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,407
Can't do it, can you?

296
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,535
So I'm thinking about you.
So what?

297
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,955
I don't get it. What do you see
in this guy anyway?

298
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,542
Well, he seems to be
a very nice guy.

299
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,879
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

300
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,594
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.

301
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,222
-Ross, it's too hard.
-No, no.

302
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,349
Because it'll get weird
for everyone else?

303
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,726
Who cares about them? This is about us.

304
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,438
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.

305
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,191
-You're, like, my best friend.
-I know.

306
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,360
-If we broke up, and I lost you—
-Whoa.

307
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,404
Why do you think we'll break up?

308
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,491
Have you been involved with someone
where you haven't broken up?

309
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,704
No.

310
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,624
But it only has to happen once.

311
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,002
You and I know
we are perfect for each other.

312
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,421
Right?

313
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,299
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

314
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,220
I don't know.

315
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,766
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

316
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,144
Well start looking.

317
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,655
Wow.

318
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,073
Exactly!

319
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,200
And you just know
I'm gonna be the guy...

320
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,370
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

321
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,207
-Right.
-Heh.

322
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,084
You're right.

323
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,544
-You know what?
-What?

324
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,047
I forgot, I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.

325
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,383
I am so sorry. I'm so-

326
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,970
If you want to stay
and finish your drinks, please do.

327
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,598
I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

328
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,516
But....

329
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,944
Excuse me! Pardon me! Excuse me.

330
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,780
I'm sorry. Ha, ha.

331
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,824
Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?

332
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,785
There's no Rachel!

333
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,793
-Oh, hey. I got that.
-Oh.

334
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,504
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.

335
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,762
I cannot wait
for you to meet my friends.

336
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,515
Really? You don't think
they'll judge and ridicule me?

337
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,517
No, they will. I just, uh....

338
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,018
-Can't wait. Heh.
-Can't wait.

339
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,770
Come on, they're gonna love you.
