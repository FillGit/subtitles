1
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,561
CHANDLER: I'm sorry.
RACHEL: Oh, my God. That's it.

2
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,022
You just barge in here
and you don't knock?

3
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,107
You have no respect
for anybody's privacy.

4
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,901
-Rachel, wait.
-No, you wait.

5
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,612
-Can I just say one thing?
-What? What?

6
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,074
That's a relatively open weave
and I can still see your...

7
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,244
-...nippular area.
-Ugh!

8
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,508
Honey, honey, tell them the story
about your patient...

9
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,468
...who thinks things are
other things.

10
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,262
You know?

11
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,515
Like when the phone rings
and she takes a shower....

12
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,019
That's pretty much it.

13
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,814
But you tell it really well, sweetie.

14
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,191
Thanks. Okay.

15
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,986
Now go away so we can
talk about you.

16
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,904
Okay. I'll miss you.

17
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,116
Isn't he great?

18
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,619
He's so cute. And he
likes you so much.

19
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,870
I know. I know.

20
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,998
He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?

21
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,627
And for a shrink,
he's not too "shrinky." You know?

22
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,754
So you think you'll do it on his couch?

23
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,757
Oh. I don't know. That's a little weird.

24
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,383
It's vinyl.

25
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,348
-Okay. You guys want anything else?
-Oh, yes.

26
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,099
-Could I have-?
-Sorry, we're all out.

27
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,601
-Anybody else?
-Okay.

28
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,395
Did I, uh, miss something?

29
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:28,815
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.

30
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,569
What were you doing
seeing her boobies?

31
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,862
It was an accident.

32
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,865
I wasn't across the street with
a telescope and a box of doughnuts.

33
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,494
Can we change the subject, please?

34
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,873
Because, hello? These aren't her
"boobies." These are her breasts.

35
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,503
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.

36
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:54,091
I don't know why you're embarrassed.
They were very nice boobies.

37
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,551
"Nice"?

38
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,053
They were "nice"?

39
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,056
That's it?
I mean, mittens are "nice."

40
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,519
Okay. Rock, hard place...

41
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,145
...me.

42
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,485
You're so funny.

43
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,780
He's really funny.

44
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,909
I wouldn't want to be there when
the laughter stops.

45
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,120
Whoa, whoa. Back up there, sparky.

46
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,665
What did you mean by that?

47
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,794
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues...

48
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,840
...that you use your humor
to keep people at a distance.

49
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,134
Huh.

50
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,220
I mean, hey, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.

51
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,140
Only child, right?

52
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,852
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.

53
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,564
Uh-huh. How did you know?

54
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,399
It's textbook.

55
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,695
Hey, you guys.

56
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,488
You all know my dad, right?

57
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,408
-How long are you in the city?
-A couple of days.

58
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,701
I got a job midtown.

59
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,786
I figure I'm better off
staying with the kid...

60
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,664
...than hauling my ass back and forth
on the ferry.

61
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,040
I don't know this one.

62
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,376
-Oh. This is my friend Roger.
-Hi.

63
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,211
-Good to meet you.
ROGER: You too.

64
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,256
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?

65
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,717
-Dad, uh....
-Oh, oh.

66
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:19,968
Excuse me.

67
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,845
So, Ross, uh, how's the wife?

68
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,433
Oh for two, huh? Heh.

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,144
Uh, Chandler, quick,
say something funny.

70
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,031
Gotta go. Ha, ha.
I miss you too.

71
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,366
I love you,
but it's getting late now-

72
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,243
Let me say hi. Hey, Ma.

73
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,164
Listen, I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and-

74
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,458
Excuse me?

75
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,505
Did you know this isn't Ma?

76
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,723
Her name's Ronni.

77
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,893
She's a pet mortician.

78
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,232
Sure.

79
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,360
So how long have you been....

80
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,365
Remember when you were a kid,
I'd take you to the Navy yard...

81
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,991
...and show you the big ships?

82
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,995
-Since then?
-No, it's only been six years.

83
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,872
I wanted to give you
a nice memory...

84
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,334
...so you'd know I wasn't always
such a terrible guy.

85
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,339
Joe, have you ever been in love?

86
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,092
I don't know.

87
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,219
Then you haven't.

88
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,806
-You're burning your tomatoes.
-Hmm. You're one to talk.

89
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,352
Joe, your dad's in love, bigtime.

90
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,355
And the worst part is,
it's with two different women.

91
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,650
Oh, man. Please tell me
one of them is Ma.

92
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,820
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?

93
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,123
It's like if you woke up one day
and found out...

94
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,458
...your dad was
leading this double life.

95
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:19,671
He's, like, actually some spy
working for the CIA.

96
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,590
That'd be cool.

97
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,842
This blows.

98
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,972
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?

99
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,141
Why do they
have to become people?

100
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,310
Why do they have-?

101
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,812
Why...

102
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,358
...can't you stop staring
at my breasts?

103
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,819
What?

104
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,364
What?

105
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,951
Didn't you get a good enough
look the other day?

106
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,578
All right, we're all adults here.

107
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,581
There's only one way
to resolve this.

108
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,333
Since you saw her boobies...

109
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,085
...I think, uh, you're gonna have to
show her your pee-pee.

110
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,972
You know,
I don't see that happening.

111
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,517
Come on. He's right.
Tit for tat.

112
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,900
Well I'm not showing you my tat.

113
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,029
Hello?

114
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,490
PHOEBE: <i>It's Phoebe.
</i>ROGER: <i>And Rog.</i>

115
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,909
Come on up.

116
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,120
Oh, good. Rog is here.

117
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,541
-What's the matter with Rog?
-Nothing. It's a little thing.

118
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,585
I hate that guy.

119
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,881
What? So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.

120
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,008
Come on, he's not that bad.

121
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,011
That's where you're wrong.
Why would I marry her...

122
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,056
...if I thought on any level
that she was a lesbian?

123
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,392
I don't know.

124
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,352
Maybe you wanted
your marriage to fail.

125
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,442
-Ha, ha.
-Why? Why would I? Why?

126
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,486
Why? Why? Why?

127
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,657
I don't know.
Maybe low self-esteem?

128
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,869
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe-

129
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,914
Wait.
Go back to that "sibling" thing.

130
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,834
Well, I don't know.

131
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,212
It's conceivable that
you sabotaged your marriage...

132
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,091
...so the sibling would be less
of a failure in the parents' eyes.

133
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,724
That's ridiculous.
I don't feel guilty for her failures.

134
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,187
-Oh, so you think I'm a failure?
-Isn't he good?

135
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,691
Yeah. No.
That's not what I was saying.

136
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,943
All these years,
I thought you were on my side...

137
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,529
...but maybe you were
sucking up to Mom and Dad...

138
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,864
...so they'd favor you.

139
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,491
Hey, I married a lesbian
to make you look good.

140
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,622
You're right.

141
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,291
I mean, you're right.

142
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,295
It wasn't just the Weebles,
but it was the Weeble Play Palace...

143
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,258
...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...

144
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:14,429
...which had this little lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.

145
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,474
That's tough, tough stuff.

146
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,102
Pheebs, if we're gonna
catch that movie, we gotta go.

147
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,979
Okay. Feel better, okay?

148
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,064
ROGER: We're gonna be late, sweetie.
-Okay.

149
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,109
-Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
-No problem.

150
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,236
It was great seeing you again.

151
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,825
Mon, uh, easy on those cookies, okay?

152
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,203
Remember, they're just food...

153
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,829
...they're not love.

154
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,919
I hate that guy.

155
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,882
JOEY:
Good night, you guys.

156
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,554
Oh, look.
It's the woman we ordered.

157
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,977
Hey. Can, uh- Can we help you?

158
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,481
Oh. No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.

159
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

160
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,238
Oh. Oh, no, not you. Big Joey.

161
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,489
Oh, my God.

162
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,367
You're so much cuter than
your pictures.

163
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,538
I'm Ronni.

164
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,792
Cheese Nip?

165
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,338
Uh, Joey's having an embolism...

166
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,215
...but I'd go for a Nip.

167
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,016
You see, most people,
when their pets pass on...

168
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,894
...they want them laid out
like they're sleeping.

169
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,273
But occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.

170
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,234
Like, uh, chasing their tail.

171
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,238
Or, uh, jumping to catch a Frisbee.

172
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,950
Joey, if I go first, I want to be
looking for my keys.

173
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,204
-That's a good one.
-Hey, Joe.

174
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,956
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

175
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,457
-Huh?
-Hi.

176
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,917
-Hey.
RONNI: Hey.

177
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,627
Hello, babe.

178
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,797
What are-? What are you doing here?

179
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,758
Oh, uh, you left your hair
at my apartment.

180
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,386
I figured you'd need it
for your meeting.

181
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,265
Thank you. Uh....

182
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,853
So who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?

183
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,442
Look, I, uh....

184
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,319
I shouldn't have come.

185
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,988
I gotta go.
I'll miss the last train.

186
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,282
No, I don't want you taking
that thing this late.

187
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,868
-Where am I gonna stay? Here?
-Whoa.

188
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,579
We'll go to a hotel.

189
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,915
We'll go to a hotel.

190
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,460
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.

191
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,588
If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.

192
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,758
I want you right here,
where I can keep an eye on you.

193
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,635
You're gonna keep an eye on us?

194
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,886
That's right, mister.

195
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,597
I don't care how old you are,
while you're here...

196
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,266
...you're gonna live by my rules.

197
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,773
And that means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.

198
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,068
Wow, he's strict.

199
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,778
Dad, you'll be in my room.

200
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,031
Ronni, uh, you can stay in
Chandler's room.

201
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,659
Thanks.
You're a good kid.

202
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,911
Come on.
I'll show you to my room.

203
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,500
That sounds weird when it's not
followed by, "No, thanks, it's late."

204
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:38,132
Okay. This is just for tonight.
Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.

205
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,885
-Six years is long enough.
-What kind of change?

206
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,096
-Break up with Ronni-
-I can't.

207
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,974
Then come clean with Ma.
This is not right.

208
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,227
I don't wanna hear it.
Now go to my room.

209
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,909
Hey, kickie.

210
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,123
-What are you doing?
-Trying to get comfortable.

211
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,251
-I can't sleep in my underwear.
-Well, you're gonna.

212
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,384
I've been thinking...

213
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,929
...about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls.

214
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,185
Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?

215
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,772
You know what I mean.
How I date all these women.

216
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,859
I always figured, when
the right one comes along...

217
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,404
...I'll be able to be a standup guy
and go the distance, you know?

218
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,032
Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking-

219
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,659
You're not him, you're you.

220
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,414
When they wanted you to go into
your father's business, did you cave?

221
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,707
-No.
-No.

222
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,251
You decided to go into
the out-of-work-actor business.

223
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,589
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

224
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,217
And I believe that
when the right woman comes along...

225
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,344
...you'll have the guts to say:

226
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,971
"No thanks, I'm married."

227
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,979
You really think so?

228
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,315
Yeah. I really do.

229
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,150
-Thanks, Chandler.
-Get off.

230
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,331
-Hi.
-Hi.

231
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,582
May I help you?

232
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,503
Uh, Joey said I could use your shower
since, uh, Chandler's in ours.

233
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,255
Okay. Who are you?

234
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,801
-Oh, uh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.
-Uh-huh.

235
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,969
The mistress?

236
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,890
-Um, come on in.
-Thanks.

237
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,059
Hi, I'm Rachel.
Bathroom's up there.

238
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,310
Hey, Ronni.

239
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,687
How long has Chandler been
in the shower?

240
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,689
Oh. Like, uh, five minutes.

241
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,067
Perfect.

242
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,862
Fasten your seat belts...

243
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,697
...it's pee-pee time.

244
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,996
Hey, Mr. Trib.

245
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,915
Hey. Good morning, dear.

246
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,712
Chandler Bing,
it's time to see your thing.

247
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,894
-What's the matter with you?
-I thought it was Chandler.

248
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,815
You were supposed to be in there
so I could see your thing.

249
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,278
Sorry, my thing
was in there with me.

250
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,036
PHOEBE: Hey.
ALL: Hey, Pheebs.

251
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,622
MONICA: How's it going?
-Good. Oh, oh.

252
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,542
Roger's having a dinner thing
and he wanted me to invite you guys.

253
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,549
-So, what's going on?
-Nothing.

254
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,426
It's just that, uh....

255
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,511
It's Roger.

256
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,514
Um, ahem, I don't know.
There's something about- Ahem.

257
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,975
Basically, we just feel
that he's, uh....

258
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,268
We hate that guy.

259
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,728
MONICA:
We hate him.

260
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,480
We're sorry, Pheebs.

261
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,981
Uh-huh. Okay.

262
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,568
Don't you think maybe it's just that
he's so perceptive...

263
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,445
...that it freaked you out?

264
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,447
-No, I hate him.
-No, we hate him.

265
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,823
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,796
Ma. What are you doing here?

267
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,049
I came to give you this...

268
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,550
-...and this.
-Ow.

269
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,260
Big ring.

270
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,555
Why did you fill your father's head
with that garbage...

271
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,433
...about making things right?

272
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,936
Things were fine the way they were.

273
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,855
There's chicken in there.
Put it away.

274
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,983
For God's sake, Joey.
Really.

275
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,987
Hold on. You knew?

276
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,573
Of course I knew.
What do you think?

277
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,201
Your father is no James Bond.

278
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,286
You should have heard
his cover stories.

279
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,789
"I'm sleeping over at
my accountant's."

280
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,291
I mean, what is that?
Please.

281
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,377
So then, how could you-?

282
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,088
Do you remember
how your father used to be?

283
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:31,550
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.

284
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,513
Not that wood shop, not those
stupid little ships in the bottle.

285
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,265
Now he's happy.

286
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,101
I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.

287
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,023
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful, but...

288
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,942
...what the hell
are you talking about?

289
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,613
-I mean, what about you?
-Me? I'm fine.

290
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,615
Look, honey...

291
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,076
...in an ideal world...

292
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,538
...there'd be no her and your father
would look like Sting.

293
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,583
And I'll tell you something else:

294
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,170
Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along...

295
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:12,717
...he's been so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.

296
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,802
He's been more loving.

297
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,555
It's like every day is
our anniversary.

298
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,182
I'm happy for you...?

299
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,600
Well, don't be.

300
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,520
Because now everything's screwed up.

301
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:30,276
I just want it the way it was.

302
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,404
JOEY:
Ma, I'm sorry.

303
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:37,116
I just did what
I thought you'd want.

304
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,287
I know you did, cookie.
Oh, I know you did.

305
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,666
So tell me....

306
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,169
Did you see her?

307
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,796
Yeah.

308
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,342
You're 10 times prettier
than she is.

309
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,885
That's sweet.

310
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,971
Could I take her?

311
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,975
With this ring, no contest.

312
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,398
ROGER: What's wrong, sweetie?
PHOEBE: Nothing.

313
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,151
No, no. What's wrong? Come on.

314
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,778
Okay.

315
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,783
It's nothing. I'm fine.

316
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,951
It's just, urn-
It's my friends.

317
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,871
They have a liking problem with you...

318
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,331
...in that, um...

319
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,957
...they don't.

320
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,754
Oh. They don't?

321
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,048
But you know...

322
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,093
...they don't see all
of the wonderfulness that I see.

323
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,846
They don't see all the good stuff
and all the sweet stuff.

324
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,640
They think you're a little....

325
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,102
-What?
-Intense and creepy.

326
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,855
Oh.

327
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,650
But I don't. Me. Phoebe.

328
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,113
Well, I'm not at all surprised
they feel that way.

329
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,740
You're not?
See, that's why you're so great.

330
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,243
Actually, it's
quite typical behavior...

331
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:06,664
...when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.

332
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,500
You know, this kind of codependent...

333
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,377
...emotionally stunted...

334
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:16,799
...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups...

335
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,386
...which, I'm sorry, might as well
have nipples on them.

336
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:26,308
And you're all like,
"Oh, define me. Define me.

337
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,311
Love me. I need love."

338
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,440
So you talked to your dad, huh?

339
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,693
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on Ma,
like she wanted.

340
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,529
Ma's gonna keep pretending
she doesn't know even though she does.

341
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,532
And my sister Tina
can't see her husband anymore...

342
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,826
...because he got
a restraining order.

343
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,080
Which has nothing to do with it,
except that I found out today.

344
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,290
Wow.

345
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,084
Things sure have changed here
on Walton's mountain.

346
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,421
So, Joey, are you okay?

347
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,173
Yeah, I guess.

348
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,675
It's just—
You know, they're parents.

349
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,887
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.

350
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,764
Even if you know better...

351
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,475
...you gotta let them make
their own mistakes.

352
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,726
And just think...

353
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,061
...in a couple years,
we get to turn into them.

354
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,688
Oh, please.

355
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,524
If I turn into my parents,
I'll either be an alcoholic blond...

356
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,777
...chasing after 20-year-old boys...

357
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,821
...or I'll end up like my mom.

358
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,869
-Hey.
ALL: Hey, Pheebs.

359
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,537
MONICA:
How's it going?

360
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,041
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

361
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,793
ALL:
Oh.

362
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,127
Yeah, right.

363
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,922
ALL:
No, no, really. Aw.

364
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,927
-What happened?
-Ugh. I don't know. I mean....

365
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,637
He's a good person...

366
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,764
...and he can be really sweet.

367
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,267
And in some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

368
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,937
It's just, I hate that guy.

369
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,113
Hey, Joey. What's going on?

370
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,991
Clear the tracks for the boobie
payback express.

371
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,035
Next stop, Rachel Green.

372
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,752
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

373
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,547
Sorry, wrong boobies.

374
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,894
Hello, Joey.

375
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,647
Hello, dear.
