1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,047
How'd someone get
your credit card number?

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,674
I have no idea.
Look how much they spent!

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,595
Calm down. You only have to pay
for the stuff you bought.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,515
Still, it's just such reckless spending.

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,600
When somebody steals your credit card...

6
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,811
...they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind.

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:28,070
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,156
That's me.

9
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,118
Oh! Oh, the yuck.

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,788
He's doing it again!

11
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,249
Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,793
Stop humping!
Now, Marcel, come back!

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,127
Come here, Marcel!

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,505
Oh, no, no! Not in my room!
I'll get him.

15
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,675
You've got to do something
about the humping.

16
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,094
What? It's just a phase.

17
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,097
Well, that's what we said about Joey.

18
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,686
Hey, would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.

19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,230
RACHEL:
Marcel, stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!

20
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,690
-What?
RACHEL: Ugh!

21
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,652
Let's just say my Curious George doll
is no longer curious.

22
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,707
Ugh, Monica, you are not still
going over that thing.

23
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,710
-This woman's living my life.
-What?

24
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:10,839
She's living my life,
and she's doing it better than me.

25
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,258
Look at this. Look.

26
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,094
She buys tickets to plays I want to see.

27
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,598
She shops at stores that
I'm intimidated by the salespeople.

28
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,351
She spent $300 on art supplies.

29
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,894
You're not an artist.

30
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,064
Yeah, well, I might be
if I had the supplies.

31
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:32,194
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.

32
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,113
Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cool things.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,449
Oh, really? Let's compare, shall we?

34
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:41,119
Oh, it's so late for "shall we?"

35
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,122
Do I go horseback riding
in the park, hmm?

36
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,333
Do I take classes at The New School?

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,502
-No.
-No.

38
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,379
This is so unfair.

39
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,965
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

40
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,559
How about Joey Paponi?

41
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,939
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks
I should have a name that's more neutral.

42
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,941
Joey Switzerland?

43
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:20,200
Plus I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm...

44
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,618
...this big.

45
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,994
Which I'm not!

46
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,875
Joe, Joe, Joe.... Stalin?

47
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,295
Stalin.

48
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,716
Do I know that name?
That sounds familiar.

49
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,428
-Well, it does not ring a bell with me.
-Huh.

50
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,806
Joe Stalin.

51
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,852
You know, that's pretty good.

52
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,563
-You might want to try Joseph.
-Ah!

53
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,530
Joseph Stalin!

54
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,324
-I think you'd remember that!
-Oh, yes!

55
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,704
<i>Bye Bye Birdie, </i>starring Joseph Stalin.

56
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,583
Joseph Stalin is the <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

57
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,092
-Hey.
-Hey.

58
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,594
Hi.

59
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,848
Hi. Uh, yes, this is Monica Geller.

60
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:29,352
Um, I'm taking classes with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

61
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,148
What are you doing?

62
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,649
All right, great.

63
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,818
Great. Thanks a lot.

64
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,820
I'm going to tap class.

65
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,240
So you can dance with the woman
that stole your card?

66
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,826
She's got my life.
I want to see who she is.

67
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,370
Go to the post office!
I'm sure her picture's up!

68
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,249
Honey, you're kind of losing it here.

69
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,252
This is really becoming
a weird obsession.

70
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,254
This is madness, I tell you.

71
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,548
For the love of God, Monica, don't do it!

72
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,137
Thank you.

73
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,104
What do you think?

74
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,273
Lots of things.

75
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,109
Which one do you think she is?

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,945
-May I help you?
-Oh, no, thanks.

77
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,863
We're just here to observe.

78
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,909
You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class!

79
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,410
Spare shoes are over there.

80
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,040
What does she mean?

81
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,084
I think she means, "You dance...

82
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,919
...a dance class!"

83
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,921
Come on, come on, come on!

84
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,673
RACHEL:
Really?

85
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,801
Hey, do you see anybody
you think could be me?

86
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:47,597
People, last time there were yogurt containers
lying around after class.

87
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,599
Let's not have that happen again!

88
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,143
She could be you.

89
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,066
Let's get started.

90
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,696
Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.

91
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,244
Okay, I'm not getting this!

92
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,539
I'm totally getting it!

93
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,422
Do you ever just feel like you're
so unbelievably uncoordinated?

94
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,432
What? You just click when they click.

95
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,811
All right.
Now everyone grab a partner.

96
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,479
Oh! Oh.

97
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:41,610
All right. And my dead mother
said you are it! I'm with Rachel.

98
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,738
Great, it's gym class all over again.

99
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,406
RACHEL & PHOEBE:
Aww.

100
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,785
That's all right. You can come up
to the front and dance with me.

101
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,998
Why don't I just take off my clothes
and have a nightmare?

102
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,966
It's okay, it's okay!
I'm here, I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.

103
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,384
Okay, here I am.

104
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,054
So who's the new tense girl?

105
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,764
She's your partner.

106
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,682
-Hi, I'm Monica.
-Hi.

107
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,393
Oh, ha.

108
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,687
Monica.

109
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,856
Hi, I'm Mon-

110
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,066
Nana.

111
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,568
-Monana?
-Yeah.

112
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,612
It's Dutch.

113
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,365
You're kidding.
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

114
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,163
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.

115
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,624
And we're dancing!

116
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,543
Five, six, seven, eight.

117
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,927
Hi.

118
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,347
-Hey.
-Hey.

119
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,767
-Where have you been?
-I just got back from the vet.

120
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,604
She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cone, is she?

121
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,652
She says Marcel's humping thing
is not a phase.

122
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,072
Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.

123
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,158
Hey, he beat you!

124
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:20,917
She says, as time goes on,
he'll start getting aggressive and violent.

125
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,585
What does this mean?

126
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,423
I have to give him up.

127
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,651
I can't believe it. This sucks!

128
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,321
You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

129
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,783
I know, I know.
One day he's this little thing...

130
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,453
...and before you know it,
he's this little thing...

131
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,247
...I can't get off my leg.

132
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,459
Isn't there any way you can keep him?

133
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,668
No. No.

134
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,672
The vet said that unless he's in a place
where he has regular access...

135
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,093
...to some monkey loving...

136
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,138
...he's just gonna get vicious.

137
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,183
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

138
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,854
-How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
-I know that one!

139
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,278
No, that's popes into a Volkswagen.

140
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:36,242
We're applying to a lot of them.
Our first choice would be a state zoo.

141
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,037
You know, like, uh, San Diego.

142
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,372
Right?

143
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,877
But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.

144
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:52,509
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

145
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,179
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

146
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,018
-Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey.

147
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,978
-Hi.
-We found the girl!

148
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,772
-What?
-Did you call the cops?

149
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,524
Nope. We took her to lunch.

150
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,401
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.

151
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,739
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you!

152
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,492
She stole! She's a stealer!

153
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,371
After you're with this woman
for 10 minutes, you forget all that.

154
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,875
I mean, she's this astounding person...

155
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,253
...with this amazing spirit!

156
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,548
Yeah, which she probably stole
from some cheerleader!

157
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,219
-Take off their hats.
-Popes in a Volkswagen!

158
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,679
Mm-hm.

159
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,683
I love that joke.

160
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:50,191
-No way! No way did you do this!
-Monana was very brave.

161
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,943
It was so wild.

162
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,071
We told them we were
the Gunnersons in room 615...

163
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,117
...only to find out the Boston Celtics
had the entire sixth floor!

164
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,787
So when they caught on to the fact
that we're short and have breasts....

165
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:07,000
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!

166
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,169
Go, Monana!

167
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,966
Well, you ladies are not
the only ones living the dream.

168
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:20,013
I get to go pour coffee for people
I don't know. Don't wait up.

169
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,349
Oh, by the way...

170
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,811
...tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

171
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,314
Excuse me?

172
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,190
There's an open call for <i>Cats.</i>

173
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,193
I'm thinking we go down there,
sing "Memories"...

174
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,447
...and make complete fools of ourselves.
What do you say?

175
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,491
No, no, no.

176
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,328
Remember who
you're dealing with here. Ha.

177
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,664
I'm not like you. I can't even
stand in front of a tap class.

178
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,833
That's because of
your Amish background.

179
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,922
-What?
-Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

180
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,173
Right.

181
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,843
Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunned.

182
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,096
I was just like you.

183
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,226
And then one day, I saw a movie
that changed my life.

184
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,312
-Did you ever see <i>Dead Poets Society?
</i>-Uh-huh.

185
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:13,149
I thought that movie was so incredibly...

186
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,359
...boring!

187
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,070
I mean, that thing at the end
where the kid...

188
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,822
...kills himself because
he can't be in the play?

189
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,991
What was that?

190
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,788
It's like, "Kid, wait a year.
Leave home, do some community theater!"

191
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,792
I walked out of there, and I thought:

192
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,380
"Now, that's two hours of my life
that I'm never getting back!"

193
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,258
And that scared me more than
all the other crap I was afraid to do.

194
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,094
Wow.

195
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,471
Then I would definitely
not recommend <i>Mrs. Doubtfire.</i>

196
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,523
Oh, God.

197
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,193
We didn't get into Scranton.

198
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,948
That was our safety zoo.

199
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,827
They take, like, dogs and cows.

200
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,247
See?

201
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,875
I don't know who this
is harder on, me or him.

202
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,629
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.

203
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,591
ROSS:
Marcel. Marcel.

204
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,051
Marcel, no.

205
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,263
Good boy!

206
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,515
See? How can nobody want him?

207
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,600
Somebody will.

208
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,273
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?

209
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,654
You're kidding!

210
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:47,160
Apparently, he was this Russian dictator
who slaughtered all these people!

211
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,457
-You'd think you would've known that!
-You'd think I would've.

212
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:59,213
Phoebe, what do you think
a good stage name for me would be?

213
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,508
Flame Boy!

214
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,893
Where exactly is your zoo?

215
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,812
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se.

216
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,732
It's, uh, more of an interactive
wildlife experience.

217
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,319
Let me ask you some questions about-
Is it, uh, Marcel?

218
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,071
-Yes.
-Yes. Uh....

219
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,239
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?

220
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,326
No, no. He's very docile.

221
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,746
Hmm. Even if he were cornered?

222
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,251
Well, I don't know. Why?

223
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,463
Um, how is he at handling small objects?

224
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,342
He can hold a banana,
if that's what you mean.

225
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,471
What about a hammer or a small blade?

226
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,936
Why would he need a blade?

227
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,189
If he's up against a jungle cat
or an animal with horns...

228
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,441
...you got to give
the little guy something.

229
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,902
Otherwise, it's just cruel!

230
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,074
He got into San Diego!

231
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,408
-What?
-Yeah.

232
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,829
We were coming back from our walk,
and the phone was ringing....

233
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,622
-He's in!
-He's in? Ah!

234
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,624
Did you hear that, Marcel?

235
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,585
San Diego! San Diego! Yeah!

236
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,880
You're making a mistake.
San Diego's well and good...

237
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,384
...but if you give him to me,
I'll start him against a blind rabbit...

238
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,553
...and give you 20 percent of the gate.

239
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,573
Yo-ho!

240
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,117
Where have you been?

241
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,245
Monica and I just crashed
an embassy party.

242
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,622
Are you drunk?

243
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,250
No!

244
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,380
I'm lying.

245
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,757
I am so drunk!

246
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,259
Oh, God!

247
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,095
Ugh. Great. You know what?
You could have called.

248
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,181
I've been up here. I've been worried-

249
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,724
Monica.

250
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,767
Monica?

251
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,523
Water rules!

252
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,111
Yes. Yes, it does.

253
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,532
The restaurant called.
They want to know if you're showing up.

254
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,242
Nope!

255
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,786
I'm going to the Big Apple Circus today.

256
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,999
What are you doing?
You're gonna lose your job. This is not you!

257
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,918
No, it is me!

258
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,296
I'm not just the person
who needs to fluff the pillows...

259
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,757
...and pay the bills as soon as they come in!

260
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:52,678
You know, when I'm with her,
I'm so much more than that!

261
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,514
I'm....

262
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,309
I'm Monana!

263
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,566
Ahem, hello?

264
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,818
Yes, she is. Hold on a second, please.

265
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,821
Ahem, Monana, it's for you.

266
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,990
The credit card people.

267
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,451
Hello?

268
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,663
Yes?

269
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,041
Oh, my God!

270
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,418
Thanks.

271
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,921
What?

272
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,549
They've arrested Monica.

273
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,353
-Hi.
-Hey.

274
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,188
How are you?

275
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,024
I'm not too bad.
Fortunately, blue's my color.

276
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,777
How did you know I was here?

277
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,406
Because...

278
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,491
...I'm Monica Geller.

279
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,704
It was my credit card you were using.

280
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,248
That I was not expecting.

281
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,042
I want you to know, I didn't turn you in.

282
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,836
Oh.

283
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,089
-Thanks.
-No, thank you.

284
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,591
You have given me so much.

285
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,927
If it wasn't for you,
I'd never have gotten...

286
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,763
...to sing "Memories"
at the Winter Garden Theater.

287
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,057
Actually, you only got to sing "Memo-"

288
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,397
I can't believe you're in here.
What am I gonna do without you?

289
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,108
Who's gonna crash
the embassy parties with me?

290
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,527
Who's gonna take me
to the Big Apple Circus?

291
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:36,574
Monica, I started my day by peeing
in front of 25 other women...

292
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:41,078
...and you're worried about who will
take you to the Big Apple Circus?

293
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,916
Well, not worried,
you know, just wondering.

294
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,586
There's nothing to wonder about.

295
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:52,548
You'll go back to being who you were
because that's who you are.

296
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,426
-Not necessarily.
-Yes, necessarily.

297
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,471
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.

298
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,602
Um, I'm not actually Amish.

299
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,313
Really? Then why are you like that?

300
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,039
You by the door, in or out?

301
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,334
In!

302
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,841
You in the back, you're getting it wrong!

303
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,843
At least I'm doing it!

304
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:56,487
WOMAN : <i>This is the final
boarding call for Flight 67 to San Diego...</i>

305
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,989
<i>...boarding at Gate 42A.</i>

306
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,534
Okay, goodbye, little monkey guy.

307
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,995
-I wrote you this poem.
-Aw.

308
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,873
Okay, but don't eat it
till you get on the plane.

309
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,918
-Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
-Aww.

310
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,382
Okay, bye, champ.

311
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,427
There's gonna be a lot of babes
in San Diego...

312
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,139
...but remember, there's also a lot to learn.

313
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,565
I don't know what to say, Ross.
Uh, it's a monkey.

314
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,026
Just say what you feel, Joey.

315
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,821
Marcel, I'm hungry.

316
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:40,865
ROSS:
That was good.

317
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,454
-Marcel, this is for you.
-Oh.

318
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,499
It's, uh, just, you know,
something to, urn...

319
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,377
...do on the plane.

320
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,216
If you don't mind,
I'd like a moment, just me and him.

321
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,386
-Sure.
-Of course. Absolutely.

322
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,264
ALL:
Oh.

323
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,977
Marcel, come here. Come here.

324
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,854
Come here.

325
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,647
Well, buddy...

326
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,067
...this is it.

327
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,362
There's just a couple of things
I wanted to say.

328
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,366
I'm really gonna miss you.

329
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,453
You know? And I'm never gonna
forget about you.

330
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,500
You've been more than just a pet to me.

331
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,293
You've been more like a-

332
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,587
Okay. Marcel, would you-?

333
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,632
Marcel, would you leave my leg alone?

334
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,427
Would you just stop humping me
for two seconds? Marc- Would you-?

335
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:47,431
Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.

336
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,165
O! that I were a glove
upon that hand...

337
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,044
...that I might touch thy cheek.

338
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,880
WOMAN:
That's fine. Thank you.

339
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,841
MAN:
Next.

340
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,347
Hi. Uh, I'll be reading
for the role of Mercutio.

341
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,475
MAN: Name?
-Holden McGroin.
