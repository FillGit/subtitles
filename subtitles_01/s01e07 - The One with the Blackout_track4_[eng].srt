1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:06,131
Everybody. Shh. Uh, Central Perk
is proud to present...

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,302
...the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

3
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:13,847
PHOEBE:
Thanks.

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,893
Hi. Um, I wanna start with a song
that's about that moment...

5
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,730
...when you suddenly realize
what life is really all about.

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,690
Okay, here we go.

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,364
Okay. Thank you very much.

8
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,996
CHANDLER:
What-?

9
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,546
Oh, great. This is just-

10
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,937
This is so cool, you guys.

11
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,231
The entire city's blacked out.

12
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,984
Mom says it's Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens...

13
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,111
...and doesn't know when
it'll be back on.

14
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,280
PHOEBE: Wow.
RACHEL: You guys, this is big.

15
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,824
Pants and a sweater.
Why, Mom?

16
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,826
Who will I meet in a blackout?

17
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,706
Power-company guys?
Eligible looters?

18
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,000
Can we talk about this later? Okay.

19
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,127
Can I borrow the phone?

20
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,631
I wanna call my apartment
and check on my grandma.

21
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,382
What's my number?

22
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,011
I never call me.

23
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,306
<i>Oh, my God. It's her.</i>

24
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,475
<i>It's that Victoria Secret model.</i>

25
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,060
<i>Something Goodacre.</i>

26
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,644
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.

27
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,314
<i>She's right. It's Jill.
Jill Goodacre.</i>

28
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,441
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

29
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,528
<i>/ am trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.</i>

30
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,741
<i>Is it a vestibule?
Maybe it's an atrium?</i>

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,912
<i>Yeah, that is the part
to focus on, you idiot.</i>

32
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,875
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck
at the bank in an ATM vestibule.

33
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,044
<i>Jill says vestibule...</i>

34
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,505
<i>...I'm going with vestibule.</i>

35
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,465
JILL:
I'm fine.

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,675
No, I'm not alone.

37
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,719
I don't know. Some guy.

38
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:02,182
<i>Oh, some guy. I am some guy.</i>

39
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,102
<i>Hey, Jill, I saw you
with some guy last night.</i>

40
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,105
<i>Yes, he was some guy.</i>

41
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,032
JOEY:
Hey, everyone.

42
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,291
Officiating at tonight's blackout
is Rabbi Tribbiani.

43
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:37,008
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish, and
these are the only candles we have...

44
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,468
...so happy Hanukkah.

45
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,849
PHOEBE: Ooh, look. Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

46
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,978
ALL:
Ooh.

47
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,479
Oh!

48
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,233
Ooh. That had to hurt.

49
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,654
<i>All right, all right.
It's been 14 and a half minutes...</i>

50
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,699
<i>...and you still haven't said
one word. Oh, God.</i>

51
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:04,703
<i>Do something.
Just make contact. Smile.</i>

52
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,833
<i>There you go.</i>

53
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,797
<i>You're definitely scaring her.</i>

54
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,592
Uh, would you like to call somebody?

55
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,637
<i>Yeah, about 300 guys I went
to high school with.</i>

56
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,728
Yeah, thanks.

57
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,149
Hello?

58
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,318
-It's me.
-It's Chandler.

59
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,611
Are you okay?

60
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,321
Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,492
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule...

62
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,788
...with Jill Goodacre.

63
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,498
What?

64
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,625
I'm stuck...

65
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,045
...in an ATM vestibule...

66
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,464
...with Jill Goodacre.

67
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,634
I have no idea what you said.

68
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,761
Put Joey on the phone.

69
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,015
What's up, man?

70
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,558
I'm stuck...

71
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,895
...in an ATM vestibule...

72
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,190
...with Jill Goodacre.

73
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,526
Oh, my God.

74
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,071
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.

75
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,241
Chandler, listen.

76
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,039
Yeah, like that thought
never entered my mind.

77
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,002
RACHEL:
Come on, somebody.

78
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,546
MONICA:
I'll go. I'll go.

79
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,967
Okay, um, senior year of college,
on a pool table.

80
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,677
JOEY: Ooh.
-Pool table?

81
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,637
That's my sister.

82
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,642
Okay, okay.
My weirdest place would have to be...

83
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:55,438
...the women's room on the second floor
of the New York City Public Library.

84
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,567
Oh, my God. What were you
doing in a library?

85
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,614
-Pheebs, what about you?
-Oh, um, Milwaukee.

86
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,745
Uh, Ross?

87
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,834
Disneyland, 1989.
"It's a small world after all."

88
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,296
No way.

89
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,881
The, uh, ride broke down...

90
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,218
...so Carol and I went behind a couple
of those mechanical Dutch children.

91
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:31,099
They fixed the ride, and we were asked
never to return to the Magic Kingdom.

92
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,435
Ooh. Rachel?

93
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,853
I already went.

94
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,980
-You did not go.
-Yes, I did.

95
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,773
MONICA:
Tell us. Come on.

96
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,820
All right, uh, the weirdest place
would have to be...

97
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,199
...the foot of the bed.

98
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,495
-Step back.
-We have a winner.

99
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,922
I've never had a relationship
with that kind of passion.

100
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,260
Where you have to have somebody right
there in the middle of a theme park.

101
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,808
It was the only thing to do there
that didn't have a line.

102
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,606
Well, Barry wouldn't even kiss me
on a miniature-golf course.

103
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,024
-Come on.
-No.

104
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,610
He said we were holding up
the people behind us.

105
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,655
And you didn't marry him because...?

106
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,118
Do you think there are people
that go through life...

107
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,788
...never having that kind of...?

108
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,623
-Probably.
-Really?

109
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,168
I'll tell you something.
Passion is way overrated.

110
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,878
-Yeah, right.
-It is.

111
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,839
Eventually, it kind of burns out.

112
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,886
But hopefully what you're left
with is trust and security and, uh....

113
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,097
In my ex-wife's case,
lesbianism.

114
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,648
For all those people who miss out
on that, uh, passion thing...

115
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,483
...there's other good stuff.

116
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,361
Okay.

117
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,822
But, um, I don't think that'll be you.

118
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,074
-You don't?
-Mm-mm.

119
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,284
See, I see, uh...

120
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,704
...big passion in your future.

121
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,497
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

122
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,040
-You do?
-I do.

123
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,209
Ross, you're so great.

124
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,635
ROSS:
Ah.

125
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,556
It's never gonna happen.

126
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,523
-What?
-You and Rachel.

127
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:53,950
Why not?

128
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,496
Because you waited too long
to make your move...

129
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,666
...and now you're in the "Friend Zone."

130
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,753
No, no, no.
I'm not in the Zone.

131
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,047
No, Ross.
You're mayor of the Zone.

132
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,468
Look, I'm taking my time, all right?

133
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,553
I'm laying the groundwork.

134
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,347
Every day I get
a little bit closer to, uh....

135
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,724
Priesthood.

136
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,354
Ross, I'm telling you, she has
no idea what you're thinking.

137
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,817
If you don't ask her out soon,
you'll end up stuck in the Zone forever.

138
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,527
I will, I will.

139
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,113
I'm waiting for the, uh, right moment.

140
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,076
What?

141
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,953
-What, now?
-Yeah.

142
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,040
What's messing you up?
The wine?

143
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,043
The candles? The moonlight? Huh?

144
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,797
You gotta go up to her and say,
"Look, Rachel, I think-"

145
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,173
-Shh!
-Shh!

146
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,675
-What are we shushing?
-We're shushing...

147
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,387
...because we're trying to
hear something.

148
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,058
-What?
-Uh, don't you hear that?

149
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,437
Ah.

150
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,731
-See?
-Huh.

151
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,197
-Would you like some gum?
-Oh. Is it sugarless?

152
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,868
-Uh, sorry, it's not.
-Then, no, thanks.

153
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,621
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

154
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:27,001
<i>Mental note: If Jill Goodacre
offers you gum, you take it.</i>

155
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:31,339
<i>If she offers you mangled
animal carcass, you take it.</i>

156
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,886
<i>New York City has no power</i>

157
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,723
<i>And the milk is getting sour</i>

158
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,310
<i>But to me it is not scary</i>

<i>La-la
La-la-la-la-la</i>

00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,284
-Here goes.
-You'll do it?

162
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,952
-I'll do it.
-Want help?

163
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,454
You come out there,
you're a dead man.

164
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,039
Ross, Ross.

165
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,125
Good luck, man.

166
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,294
Thanks.

167
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,257
-Okay.
-Okay.

168
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,180
JOEY: Where you going?
MONICA: Outside.

169
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,389
You can't go out there.

170
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,268
-Why not?
-Because of, uh, the reason.

171
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,354
And that would be...?

172
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,857
I, uh- I can't tell you.

173
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,192
What's going on?

174
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:37,947
Okay, listen. You gotta promise you'll
never, ever tell Ross that I told you.

175
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,034
-About what?
-He's planning your birthday party.

176
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,579
Oh, my God. I love him.

177
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,289
You better act surprised.

178
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,833
-About what?
-My surprise party.

179
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,087
-What surprise party?
-Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.

180
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,214
Well, he didn't tell me.

181
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,760
Don't look at me.
This is Ross' thing.

182
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,305
This is so typical. I'm always
the last to know everything.

183
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,225
-You are not. We tell you stuff.
-Uh-huh.

184
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:10,021
I was the last one to know when Chandler
got bit by the peacock at the zoo.

185
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,816
I was the last to know you had a crush
on Joey when he was moving in.

186
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,526
What?

187
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,821
Oh. Looks like I was second to last.

188
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,246
It's so nice.

189
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,710
Hey, I have a question.

190
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,923
Uh, actually, it's not
so much a question...

191
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,801
...it's more of a general wondering...

192
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,095
...ment.

193
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,722
-Okay.
-Okay.

194
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,891
Here goes.

195
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:53,356
Um, well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to, um....

196
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,192
-Oh.
-Yes, that's right.

197
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,736
Look at that little kitty.

198
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,029
What?

199
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,953
<i>I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation</i>

200
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:12,333
<i>And the only explanation I can find</i>

201
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:17,714
<i>Is the love that I found
Ever since you've been around</i>

202
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,343
All right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.

203
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,388
Ow. Ow.

204
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,974
Sorry, that was wax.

205
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,271
Poor little Tootie's scared.
We should find his owner.

206
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,857
Why not put "poor little Tootie"
in the hall?

207
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,777
During a blackout?
She'll get trampled.

208
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,029
Yeah?

209
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,784
You know, on second thought,
gum would be perfection.

210
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,871
<i>Gum would be perfection?</i>

211
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,249
<i>Gum would be perfection.</i>

212
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,045
<i>Could've said, "Gum would be nice."
"I'llhave a stick."But, no.</i>

213
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,506
<i>For me, gum is perfection.</i>

215

Oh, no, the Mellons.
They hate all living things, right?

216
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,100
PHOEBE:
Oh.

217
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,775
Hi. We just found this cat...

218
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,526
...and we're looking for the owner.

219
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,154
Um, yeah, it's, uh- It's mine.

220
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,158
He seems to hate you.
Are you sure?

221
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,160
Yeah. It's my cat. Give me my cat.

222
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,829
Wait a minute. What's his name?

223
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,873
Um, Bob- Buttons.

224
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,793
-Bob Buttons?
-Uh-huh.

225
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,878
Bob Buttons.
Here, Bob Buttons.

226
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,671
Oh!

227
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,508
You are a very bad man.

228
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,636
You owe me a cat.

229
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,892
RACHEL:
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

230
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,936
Here, kitty, kitty.

231
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,897
Where did you go,
little kitty, kitty, kitty?

232
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,944
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty....

233
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,032
Hi.

234
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,036
Wow.

235
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,083
Come on, lucky sixes.

236
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,753
Everybody, this is Paolo.

237
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,339
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.

238
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,425
-This is Monica...
-Hi.

239
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,845
-...and Joey...
MONICA: Hi.

240
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,557
-...and Ross.
MONICA: Hi.

241
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,065
Ha, ha. He doesn't speak much English.

242
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,193
Monopoly.

243
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,446
Look at that.

244
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,782
So, uh....

245
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,160
Where did, uh, Paolo come from?

246
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,704
Italy, I think. Heh.

247
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,875
No, I mean tonight, in the building?
Suddenly into our lives?

248
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,338
The cat turned out to be
Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny?

249
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,427
That is funny. And Rachel
keeps touching him.

250
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,309
I looked all over the building
and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.

251
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,978
Oh, I found him.
It was Paolo's cat.

252
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,565
Ah. Well, there you go.
Last to know again.

253
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,944
And I'm guessing, since nobody
told me, this is Paolo?

254
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,947
Oh. Paolo, this is Phoebe.

255
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,787
You betcha.

256
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,586
<i>All right. Okay. What next?</i>

257
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,755
<i>Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.</i>

258
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,926
<i>It's got a, uh, boyish charm.
It's impish.</i>

259
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,552
<i>Here we go.</i>

260
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,690
<i>Nice going, imp.</i>

261
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,944
<i>Okay. It's okay. All I need to do is...</i>

262
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:12,615
<i>...reach over and put it
back in my mouth.</i>

263
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,079
<i>Good save.
We're back on track and I'm...</i>

264
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,457
<i>...chewing someone else's gum.</i>

265
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,335
<i>This is not my gum.</i>

266
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,420
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

267
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,298
<i>And now you're choking.</i>

268
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,343
Are you all right?

269
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,389
Oh, my God.
You're choking.

270
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,853
Better?

271
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,313
Yes.

272
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,399
Thank you. That was....

273
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,900
That was....

274
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,569
Perfection?

275
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,135
What'd he say that was so funny?

276
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,054
I have absolutely no idea.

277
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,473
That's classic.

278
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,684
My God, you guys.
What am I doing?

279
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,769
This is so un-me.

280
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,521
If you want, I'll do it.

281
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,526
I know. I just wanna bite his bottom lip.

282
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,903
But I won't.

283
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,240
God. The first time he smiled at me...

284
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,578
...those three seconds were more exciting
than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.

285
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,204
Did you rent mopeds?

286
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,833
Because I've heard-

287
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,711
Oh, it's not about that right now. Okay.

288
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,923
I know it's totally superficial,
and we have nothing in common...

289
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,676
....and we don't even speak
the same language...

290
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,386
...but, God.

291
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,559
Paolo, hi.

292
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,270
-Ross.
-Listen, uh....

293
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,569
Listen, um, hen,
something you should, uh, know.

294
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,947
Rachel and I are....

295
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,617
We're kind of a thing.

296
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,787
-Thing?
-Thing. Yes, thing.

297
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,289
-You have the sex?
-No.

298
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:32,546
No, no. Um, technically,
the sex is not being had. But that's, uh....

299
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,715
That's not the point.

300
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,929
The point is that, uh,
Rachel and I should be, uh....

301
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,391
Well, Rachel and I
should be together.

302
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,476
And if you get in the, uh....

303
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,353
-In bed?
-No.

304
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,482
Ha. No, not where I was going.

305
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:56,654
If you get in the way of us
becoming a thing...

306
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,740
...then, uh, I would be, well, very sad.

307
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,534
Oh.

308
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:02,952
So do you, urn...?

309
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,378
-You do know a little English?
-Little.

310
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,214
Do you know the word crap-weasel?

311
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:20,302
No? That's funny,
you are a huge crap-weasel.

312
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,228
Chandler, we've been here for an hour
doing this. Watch, it's easy.

313
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,729
-Ready?
-Mm-hm.

314
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,360
Okay? Now try it.

315
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,697
You gotta whip it.

316
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:48,456
Look, look. The last candle's
about to burn out.

317
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:52,877
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

318
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:57,506
...minus 46, minus 47,
minus 48....

319
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,760
ROSS: Thank you.
MONICA: Thanks.

320
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,972
ROSS:
Kind of spooky without any lights.

321
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,149
ROSS:
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.

322
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,871
Uh, Ross....

323
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,540
This probably isn't the best time
to bring it up...

324
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,335
...but you have to throw
a party for Monica.

325
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,678
-This has been fun.
-Yes.

326
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,307
Yes. Thanks for, uh, letting me
use your phone...

327
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,601
...and for saving my life.

328
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,604
Well, goodbye, Chandler.

329
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,856
I had a great blackout.

330
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,067
See you.

331
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:19,547
Hi. Um, I'm account number 7143457.
And I don't know if you got any of that...

332
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,300
...but I would really
like a copy of the tape.
