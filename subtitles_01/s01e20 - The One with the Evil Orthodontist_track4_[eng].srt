1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,340
I can't believe
you would actually say that.

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,843
I would much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. Salty.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,055
No way. Mr. Salty is a sailor, all right?

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,849
He's gotta be, like,
the toughest snack there is.

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,771
I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with corn nuts.

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,023
They're crazy.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,569
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You gotta come see this.

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,780
There's some creep out there
with a telescope.

9
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,993
I can't believe it. He's looking right at us.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,454
Oh, that is so sick.

11
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,373
I feel violated.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,291
And not in a good way.

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,085
How can people do that?

14
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,507
Oh, you guys, look.
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.

15
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,522
I'm telling you, years from now,
school children will study it...

16
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,692
...as one of the greatest
first dates of all time.

17
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,736
It was unbelievable.

18
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,905
We could totally be ourselves.
We didn't have to play any games.

19
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,534
-So have you called her yet?
-Let her know I like her? Are you insane?

20
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,578
Guys. It's gross.

21
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,456
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?

22
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,041
I'm right. Right?

23
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,792
-Let her dangle.
-Yeah, definitely.

24
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,044
Oh.

25
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,755
I can't believe my parents
are pressuring me...

26
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,840
...to find one of you people.

27
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,718
God. Come on. Just do it.

28
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,388
Call her. Stop being so testosterone-y.

29
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,309
Which, by the way,
is the real San Francisco treat.

30
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,233
-I got her machine.
-Her answering machine?

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,778
No, interestingly enough,
her leaf blower picked up.

32
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,742
So, um, why didn't you say anything?

33
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,828
Oh, no, no, no. Last time I left
a spontaneous message...

34
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,581
...I ended up using the phrase,
"Yes, indeed-io."

35
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,462
MONICA: Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
No, no, don't everybody look at once.

36
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,715
-Okay, okay. What's going on?
-Okay, they're just talking.

37
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,550
Yeah, well, does he look upset?

38
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,261
Does he look like
he was just told to shove anything?

39
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,641
No. No, actually, he's smiling.

40
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,102
Oh, my God. Don't do that.

41
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,269
What? What? What?

42
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,815
That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.

43
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,359
Oh.

44
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,363
And basically, that's how
a bill becomes a law.

45
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,948
GROUP:
Oh.

46
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,452
-See? Hey, Rach.
-Hey.

47
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,287
How'd it go?

48
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,333
You know, it was, un-
it was actually really great.

49
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,419
Took me to lunch
at the Russian Tea Room.

50
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:34,005
I had that chicken, you know,
where you poke it and butter squirts out.

51
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,258
Not a good day for birds.

52
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,176
And then we took a walk to Bendel's.

53
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:42,139
And I told him not to, but he got me
a little bottle of Chanel.

54
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,726
That's nice. Now was that before
or after you told him...

55
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,314
...to stop calling, stop sending you flowers
and to generally leave you alone, huh?

56
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:55,652
Right. Well, we never actually got to that.

57
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,947
Oh, it was just so nice to see him again,
you know? It was-

58
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,492
It was comfortable and it was familiar.

59
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,202
It was just nice.

60
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,997
That's "nice" twice.

61
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,332
Rachel, what's going on?

62
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,960
Isn't this the same Barry
who you left at the altar?

63
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,837
Duh. Where have you been?

64
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,716
Yeah, but it was different with him today.

65
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,760
He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy,
you know?

66
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,681
I mean, we had fun.
Is there anything wrong with that?

67
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,267
Yes.

68
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,979
-Why?
-I have my reasons.

69
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,067
Okay, how about the fact that
he's engaged to another woman...

70
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,320
...who just happens to be
your ex-best friend?

71
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,573
All right. All right, all right, all right.
I know it's stupid.

72
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,076
I'll go see him this afternoon
and I will just put an end to it.

73
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,912
Wow.

74
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,457
-Wow.
-Ha, ha.

75
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,042
Yeah.

76
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,545
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.

77
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,423
No, it wasn't.

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,679
Oh. It was so nice
having this little sink here.

79
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,395
"Oh, Danielle,
I wasn't expecting the machine.

80
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,275
Give me a call when you get a chance."

81
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,321
Bye-bye.

82
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,365
Oh, God.

83
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,537
That's what you've been working on
for the past two hours?

84
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,872
Hey, I've been honing.

85
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,999
What was with the dishes?

86
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,169
Oh, uh, I wanted her to think
I might be in a restaurant...

87
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,464
...you know,
I might have some kind of life.

88
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,968
Like I haven't been sitting around here
honing for the last two hours?

89
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,554
He's doing it again.
The guy with the telescope.

90
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,430
PHOEBE:
Oh, my God.

91
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,936
Oh. Go away.
Stop looking in here!

92
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,730
Great. Now he's waving back.

93
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,817
We gotta do something
about that guy.

94
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,319
This morning, I caught him
looking into our apartment.

95
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,114
It creeps me out. I feel like I can't do stuff.

96
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,242
What kind of stuff?

97
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,871
Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff...

98
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,666
...but, like, when I'm cooking naked.

99
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,378
You cook naked?

100
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,715
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.

101
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,721
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.

102
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,641
What's the matter?

103
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,061
Oh, I just-
Oh, Barry, this was not good.

104
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,189
No, it was. It was very, very good.

105
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,943
-What about Mindy?
-Oh, way better than Mindy.

106
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,948
No, not that.
I mean, what about you and Mindy?

107
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,493
Oh. If you want,
I'll just break it off with her.

108
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,995
No. No, no, no.

109
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,623
No, don't do that. Not for me.

110
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,376
BERN ICE: <i>Dr. Farber,
Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.</i>

111
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,128
Thanks, Bernice.

112
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,881
Let's go away this weekend.

113
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,342
Oh, Barry. Come on. This is all way too-

114
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,135
No, we can go to Aruba.

115
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,097
When I went there on what
would've been our honeymoon...

116
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,267
...it was, uh- It was really nice.
You would've liked it.

117
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,647
I had a bra.

118
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,992
Hey, Dr. Farber.

119
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,412
All right, Miss Green,
everything looks fine.

120
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,958
Yep, I think we're starting to see
some real progress here.

121
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,881
-What?
-I'm 12, I'm not stupid.

122
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,102
-Can I use your phone?
-Yeah.

123
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,896
Uh, but for future reference,
um, that thing in your hand...

124
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,190
...can also be used as a phone.

125
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,570
Yes, it's working.

126
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,282
Why isn't she calling me back?

127
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,368
Maybe she never got your message.

128
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,997
You know, you could call her machine,
and if she has a lot of beeps...

129
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,999
...that means she probably
didn't get her messages yet.

130
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,962
-You don't think that makes me seem-?
-Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

131
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,424
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.

132
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,013
-How many beeps?
-She answered.

133
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,184
You see, this is where you'd use
that "hello" word we talked about.

134
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,187
I'm not going to.
She obviously got my message...

135
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,233
...and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

136
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,987
God, I miss just being needy.

137
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,406
GROUP:
Hey.

138
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,199
So how'd he take it?

139
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,785
Pretty well, actually.

140
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,833
Uh, Rach. How come you have
dental floss in your hair?

141
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,669
Oh, do I?

142
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,549
We ended up having sex in his chair.

143
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,051
You had sex in his chair?

144
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,559
I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?

145
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,937
You had what?

146
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,815
Sex in his chair.

147
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,611
What...?

148
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,196
What were you thinking?

149
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,491
I don't know.
I mean, we still care about each other.

150
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,744
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.

151
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,954
No. No, no.

152
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,707
It's nothing like me and Carol.

153
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,920
Please. If she said to you,
"Ross, I want you on this couch...

154
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,380
...right here, right now,"
what would you say?

155
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,968
If it helps I could slide over.

156
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,973
It's a totally different situation.

157
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,560
It's apples and oranges.
It's orthodontists and lesbians-

158
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,270
I gotta go.

159
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,816
-Where are you going?
-I just have to go, all right?

160
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,361
Do I need a reason, huh?
I have things to do with my life.

161
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,696
I have a jam-packed schedule.

162
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,951
And I am late for keeping up with it,
okay?

163
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,914
Hello? Hello?

164
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,796
Hello?

165
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,007
Huh. Mindy.

166
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,427
Hi. Hey, how are you?

167
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,598
Yes, yes, I heard. Congratulations.
That is so great.

168
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,143
Really, oh, God-

169
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,019
Okay.

170
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,646
Okay, I'm working tomorrow...

171
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,149
...but if you want,
you can come by if you'd like.

172
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,860
Okay.

173
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,528
Great.

174
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,488
Great.

175
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,865
All right.

176
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,576
So I'll see you tomorrow.

177
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,953
Okay. Bye.

178
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,707
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

179
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,294
So how's Mindy?

180
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,755
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow.

181
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,800
Oh, she sounded really weird.
I gotta call Barry.

182
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,432
Hi, it's me. I just- Ha! Mindy.

183
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,602
Mindy. Hi.

184
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,353
No, I figured that's where you'd be.

185
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,372
Hell is filled with people like you.

186
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,210
He's back. The peeper's back.

187
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,130
-Get down.
-Get down?

188
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,882
And boogie.

189
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,346
Thanks, but I gotta go to work
and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

190
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,222
Relax. She may not even know.

191
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,851
Please, I haven't heard from her
in seven months, and now she calls me.

192
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,103
I mean, what else is it about?

193
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,314
She was my best friend, you guys.

194
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,233
We went to camp together...

195
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,653
-...she taught me how to kiss....
-Yeah?

196
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,199
Now, you know,
I'm, like, the other woman.

197
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,285
-Ugh, I feel so-
-Naughty.

198
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,790
-I'll see you guys later.
-I'll walk out with you.

199
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,459
When she taught you to kiss,
you were at camp...

200
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,754
...and were you wearing
any kind of little uniform or-?

201
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,716
That's fine, yeah.

202
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,345
Okay, I'm gonna go the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?

203
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,472
-Why don't you just take it with you?
-Hey.

204
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,684
We haven't been on a second date.
She needs to hear me pee?

205
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,519
Why don't you just call her?

206
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,897
I can't call her. I left a message.
I have some pride.

207
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,899
-Do you?
-No.

208
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,949
Danielle, hi.

209
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,159
Hi, it's Chandler.

210
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,620
I'm fine. Ahem.

211
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,372
Uh, listen....

212
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,251
I don't know if you tried to call me
because, uh, idiot that I am...

213
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,045
...I accidentally shut off my phone.

214
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:22,427
Ahem. Oh, okay. That's fine.
That's great. Okay.

215
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,763
She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.

216
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,683
She's on the other line,
gonna call me back.

217
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,727
She's on the other line,
gonna call me back.

218
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,229
-Don't you have to pee?
-That's why I'm dancing.

219
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,820
-Mindy.
-Hey, you.

220
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,989
Hey, you.

221
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,161
So, what's up?

222
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,581
Um, we should really be sitting for this.

223
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,041
Hmm.

224
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,126
Sure we should.

225
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,305
-So....
-Now, I know things have been weird lately.

226
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,683
But you're my oldest friend,
except for Laurie Schaefer...

227
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,351
...who I don't talk to anymore...

228
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,104
...because she's bitter
that she lost the weight...

229
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,774
...and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.

230
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,237
Okay, I'm gonna just ask you this once,
and I want a straight answer.

231
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,947
Okay.

232
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,826
Will you be my maid of honor?

233
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,874
-Of course!
-Oh, that's so great!

234
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,876
It is! It is!

235
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,838
-Is that all you wanted to ask?
-That's all.

236
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,552
What? What?

237
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,221
That's not all.

238
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,558
-Oh, sure it is.
-Oh, no, it isn't. No.

239
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,229
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.

240
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,774
What would make you think that?

241
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,985
Well, ever since we announced
the engagement, he's acted weird.

242
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,823
And then last night, he came home
smelling like Chanel.

243
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,701
Really?

244
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,622
Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better...

245
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,334
...when Barry and I got engaged,
he went through a weird thing too.

246
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,837
Oh, God.
You see, that's what I was afraid of.

247
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,924
-What? What's what you were afraid of?
-Okay, okay.

248
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:29,929
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and I...

249
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,891
...kind of had a little thing on the side.

250
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,061
-What?
-I know, I know.

251
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,480
When he proposed to me,
everyone said, "Don't do it.

252
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,526
He's gonna do to you what he did
to Rachel." And now I feel so stupid.

253
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,445
Ha, ha.

254
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,823
Hmm. Oh, Mindy.

255
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,491
Oh, you are so stupid.

256
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,121
Oh, we are both so stupid.

257
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,664
What do you mean?

258
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,711
-Smell familiar?
MINDY: Oh, no.

259
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,212
RACHEL:
Mm-hm.

260
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,381
Oh, I'm so sorry.

261
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,342
Oh, no, me. I am so sorry.

262
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,845
No, I am sorry. I'm sorry.

263
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,402
Oh, my.

264
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,990
Four letters, "circle or hoop."

265
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,533
Ring, damn it, ring.

266
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,243
Thanks.

267
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,789
You know our phone's not working?

268
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,458
What?

269
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,420
I tried to call you from the coffee shop.
There was no answer.

270
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,214
I turned it off.

271
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,966
Mother of God, I turned it off.

272
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,635
Just like you told her you did.

273
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,222
Just pointing out the irony.

274
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,434
So listen, I went across the street
and talked to the doorman.

275
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,395
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?

276
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,483
Can I use your phone?

277
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,906
Yeah, the number
for a Sidney Marks, please.

278
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,824
"Heating device."

279
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,202
Radiator.

280
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,995
Five letters.

281
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,830
"Rdtor."

282
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,629
Yeah, is Sidney there?

283
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,881
Oh, this is?

284
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,968
-Sidney's a woman.
-So she's a woman, so what?

285
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,470
Yeah, yeah, so what?

286
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,347
Look, I live across the street...

287
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,808
...and I know all about you
and your telescope.

288
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,935
And I don't appreciate it, okay?

289
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,896
Yeah, I can see you right now. Hello?

290
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,191
Look, if I wanna walk around my apartment
in my underwear...

291
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,278
...I shouldn't have to feel like-
Thank you.

292
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,074
That's not really the point.

293
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,867
The point is, that-

294
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,912
-Mostly free-weights, but occasionally-
-Joey.

295
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,667
Yeah, my neighbor. Yeah, the brunette.

296
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,754
She said you looked pretty that day
in the green dress.

297
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,508
The green dress? Really?

298
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,344
She said you looked like Ingrid Bergman
that day.

299
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,055
Heh. No.

300
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,312
-Hey.
-Hey.

301
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,272
-You got a second?
-Sure, sure.

302
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,898
Come on...

303
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,358
...in.

304
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,818
Hello, sweetheart.

305
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:36,407
-What you guys doing here?
-Uh, we are here to break up with you.

306
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,909
Both of you?

307
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,331
We think you're a horrible human being,
and bad things should happen to you.

308
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,127
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. God, I am so sorry.

309
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,755
I'm an idiot. I was weak.
I couldn't help myself.

310
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,008
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.

311
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,763
Uh, which one of us
are you talking to there, Bar?

312
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,556
Urn....

313
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,933
Mindy.

314
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,811
Mindy, of course, Mindy.
It was always Mindy.

315
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,481
Even when we were having sex
in that chair?

316
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:12,360
I swear, look, whatever I was doing,
I was always thinking of you.

317
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,403
Oh, please.

318
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,948
During that second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup.

319
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,200
You did it twice?

320
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,828
Well, the first time didn't really count.
You know, it was Barry.

321
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,705
Oh, right.

322
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,832
Honey, baby, sweetheart, look....

323
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,918
Just give me another chance, okay?

324
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,129
We'll start all over again.
We'll go back to Aruba.

325
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,299
What do you say?

326
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,427
BERNICE :
<i>Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here.</i>

327
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,222
<i>Jason Castalano's
choking on his retainer.</i>

328
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,266
Oh, God. Uh, I'll be right there, Bernice.

329
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,727
Look, please,
please don't go anywhere, okay?

330
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,064
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

331
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:53,234
Okay, and we'll be here, hating you.

332
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,154
See how he was sweating
when he walked out of here?

333
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,699
If I'm hogging the ball,
you jump right in there...

334
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,577
...and take a couple of punches.
Because I'm telling you, this feels great.

335
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,623
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.

336
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,918
What are you talking about?

337
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,879
Mindy, the guy is the devil.

338
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,215
He is Satan in a smock.

339
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,884
Look, I know he's not perfect.

340
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,974
But the truth is,
at the end of the day...

341
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,601
...I still really wanna be...

342
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,397
...Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber...

343
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,691
...D.D.S.

344
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,860
Oh, God.

345
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,738
I hope you can find some way
to be happy for me.

346
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,366
And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.

347
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,704
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.

348
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,504
You okay?

349
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,298
Yeah.

350
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,592
Really?

351
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,594
Yeah.

352
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,513
You know, ever since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding...

353
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,641
...I have wondered
whether I made the right choice.

354
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,060
Oh. And now I know.

355
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,855
MONICA:
I'm so glad.

356
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,777
Big day.

357
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,623
All right, I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

358
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,834
I mean, he's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat....

359
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,878
Did you know he's gay?

360
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,093
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

361
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,056
-Chandler?
-Danielle, hi.

362
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,767
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.

363
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,143
GROUP:
Hi.

364
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,729
-What are you doing here?
-I've been calling you...

365
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,940
...but it turns out
I had your number wrong.

366
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,443
And when I finally got the right one
from Information, there was no answer.

367
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,613
So I thought I'd just come down here
and make sure you were okay.

368
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,407
Oh, uh, I'm okay.

369
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,118
Listen, uh, maybe we could
get together later?

370
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,622
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.

371
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:12,957
-You know.
-Ha, ha.

372
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,500
-You got it.
CHANDLER: Okay.

373
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,585
-Bye, everybody.
GROUP: Bye.

374
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,047
Woo-hoo! Yeah, there you go.

375
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,007
Second date.

376
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,926
I don't know.

377
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,302
RACHEL:
You don't know?

378
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,223
Oh, she seems nice, but that thing
about her coming all the way here...

379
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,810
...just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?
