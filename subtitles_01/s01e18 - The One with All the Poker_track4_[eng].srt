1
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,434
Rach, we're running low
on resumes over here.

2
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,437
Do you really want a job
with <i>Popular Mechanics?</i>

3
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,899
Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics,
those are the ones to work for.

4
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,486
Hey, look, you guys.
I'm going for anything here, okay?

5
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,696
I can't be a waitress anymore. I mean it.

6
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,575
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called "Excuse Me."

7
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,579
Rach, did you proofread these?

8
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,581
Uh, yeah. Why?

9
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:45,420
Uh, nothing. I'm sure they'll be impressed
with your excellent "compuper" skills.

10
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,006
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,717
Oh, do you think it's on all of them?

12
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,349
Oh, no, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few.

13
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,652
-Hey, guys.
BOTH: Hey.

14
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,280
Hey. Hi, ladies.

15
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,949
Uh, can I get you anything?

16
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,035
-Did you bring the mail?
-Lots of responses.

17
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,121
Really? Sure we have scones left.

18
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,081
Okay, read them to me.

19
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:07,836
"Dear Miss Green: Thank you
for your inquiry. However...."

20
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,089
-We have apple cinnamon-
-Okay, "Dear Miss Green"....

21
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,426
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No.

22
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,637
-Wow.
-What?

23
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,223
Your Visa bill is huge.

24
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,142
Give me that.

25
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,436
You know, I can't believe you.
Linda is so great.

26
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,646
-Why won't you go out with her again?
-I don't know.

27
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,565
Is this still about her whole...

28
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,234
..."The Flintstones could
have really happened" thing?

29
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,695
It's not just that.

30
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,698
It's just, I want someone
who does something for me...

31
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,784
...you know,
who gets my heart pounding...

32
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,870
...who makes me, uh....

33
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,041
Little play things with yarn?

34
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,002
What?

35
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,713
Could you want her more?

36
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,340
Who?

37
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,052
Who? Dee, the sarcastic sister
from <i>What's Happening!!</i>

38
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,556
Who?

39
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,187
Look, I am totally, totally over her, okay?

40
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,939
-I just- Hi.
-Hi. Coffee?

41
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,483
-No, we're fine.
-Okay.

42
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,906
Shut up.

43
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,950
We're not saying anything.

44
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,703
-What?
-Uh, Joey cried last night.

45
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,664
Thank you.

46
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,416
We were playing poker, right?

47
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,544
There was chocolate on the three.
It looked like an eight, all right?

48
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,549
Oh, God, you should've seen him.
"Read them and weep."

49
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,634
And then he did.

50
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,556
Well, now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?

51
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,850
Yeah, what is that?
Like some kind of guy thing?

52
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,893
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

53
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,396
Like, it's poker, so only guys can play?

54
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,231
No. Women are welcome to play.

55
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,732
Oh, okay, so then what is it?

56
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,194
Some kind of, you know, like,
some kind of, you know, like....

57
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,196
All right, what is it?

58
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,033
There just don't happen
to be any women in our game.

59
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,079
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any
women that know how to play poker.

60
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,250
Oh, please. That is such a lame excuse.
I mean, it's a typical guy response.

61
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,377
Excuse me, do any of you
know how to play?

62
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,045
No.

63
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,756
But you could teach us.

64
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,425
No.

65
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:27,559
Okay, so now we draw cards.

66
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,023
So I wouldn't need any, right?
Because I have a straight.

67
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,484
-Oh, good for you.
-Congratulations.

68
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,447
Okay, Pheebs, how many do you want?

69
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:45,702
Okay, I just need two.
The 10 of spades and the six of clubs.

70
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,080
No, uh, Pheebs, you can't do that.

71
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,124
I have the 10 of spades.
Here, you want it?

72
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,667
Thanks.

73
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,379
Uh, no, see, uh, you can't do that.

74
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,924
No, no. That's okay. I don't need them.
I'm going for fours.

75
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,467
Oh, you're....

76
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,265
All right, here we go.

77
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,685
We've got salmon roulettes
and assorted crudites.

78
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,646
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Monica, what are you doing?

79
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,650
This is a poker game. You can't serve food
with more than one syllable.

80
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,278
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz-

81
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,324
Okay, so at this point, the dealer-

82
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,161
You know what? We got it. We got it.
Let's play for real. High stakes. Big bucks.

83
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,705
All right, now, you sure?
Phoebe just threw away two jacks...

84
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,582
...because they didn't look happy.

85
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,965
But I'm ready. So just deal.

86
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:43,093
Okay, all right, last minute lesson.
Last minute lesson. Joey.

87
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,761
Three...

88
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,429
...eight.

89
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,598
Eight, three. All right. Here we go.

90
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,772
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

91
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,567
I see. So then, um, you were lying.

92
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,027
-About what?
-About how good your cards were.

93
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,946
Heh. I was bluffing.

94
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,199
Aha. And what is "bluffing"?

95
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,162
Is it not another word for lying?

96
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,665
Okay, sorry to break up this party...

97
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,042
...but I've got resumes to fax
before work tomorrow.

98
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,503
ROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Rach, we've got to settle.

99
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,422
Settle what?

100
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,592
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

101
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,555
You see, King George
is giving us the land, so....

102
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,477
The game, Rachel. The game.
You owe us money for the game.

103
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,729
Oh, right.

104
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,357
You know what, guys? It's their first time.
Why don't we forget about the money?

105
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,152
Hell, no. We'll pay.

106
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,572
Okay, Monica,
I had another answer all ready.

107
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,199
And you know what?

108
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,036
-We want a rematch.
-Well, that's fine with me.

109
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,246
Could use the money.

110
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:58,460
So, basically, you get your ya-yas
by taking money from all of your friends.

111
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,797
-Yeah.
-Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea.

112
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,511
You have to put them together yourself,
but they cost a little less.

113
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,599
Look, Rachel, this is poker.
I play to win, all right?

114
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,101
In order for me to win,
other people have to lose.

115
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,855
So if you're gonna play poker with me,
don't expect me to be a nice guy.

116
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,025
Okay, because once those cards
are dealt....

117
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,619
Yeah?

118
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,083
I'm not a nice guy.

119
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,508
All right, boys. Let's eat.

120
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,303
Ah, did you get that from
the "I Love Rachel" pizzeria?

121
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,514
-You still on that?
-Come on.

122
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,849
What was with that whole
Black Bart speech?

123
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,436
"When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy".

124
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,605
You're way off, pal.

125
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,442
No, I don't think so.
See, Ross, because I think you love her.

126
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,319
Uh, no.

127
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,823
See, I might have had feelings for her
at one time. Not anymore.

128
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,701
I just- Marcel.

129
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,246
Where are you going with that disk?
You are not putting that on again.

130
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:21,543
Marcel- Okay. If you press that button,
you are in very, very big trouble.

131
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,435
You believe what a jerk Ross was being?

132
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,021
Yeah, I know.
He can get really competitive.

133
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,817
What?

134
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,696
Oh. "Hello, Kettle, this is Monica.
You're black."

135
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,656
Please.

136
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,661
I am not as bad as Ross.

137
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,290
Oh, I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

138
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,500
That was not an incident.

139
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:07,255
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

140
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,757
Oh.

141
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:14,637
-Oh! I got an interview. I got an interview.
-You're kidding. Where? Where?

142
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:19,392
-Saks Fifth Avenue.
-Oh, Rachel.

143
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,062
Oh, it's like the mother ship
is calling you home.

144
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,111
-Well, what's the job?
-Assistant buyer.

145
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,823
Oh! I would be shopping...

146
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,910
...for a living.

147
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,330
Okay, look. That's Aunt Iris.

148
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,832
This woman has been playing poker
since she was 5.

149
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,335
You've gotta listen
to every word she says.

150
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,712
-Hi.
-Is Tony Randall dead?

151
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,297
-Oh, why?
-I don't think so.

152
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,509
Well, he may be now
because I think I hit him with my car.

153
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,762
-My God. Really?
-No, that's bluffing. Lesson number one.

154
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,641
Let me tell you something.

155
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,394
Everything you hear
at a poker game is pure crap.

156
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,939
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.

157
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,568
Girls, sit down.

158
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,571
-Um, Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe, and Rachel-
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

159
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,783
Listen, I am parked at a meter.
Let's do it.

160
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,587
Ross, could we please, please,
listen to anything else?

161
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,214
All right.

162
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,774
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

163
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,030
-Hi.
-Hey.

164
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,657
Guess what, guess what, guess what.

165
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:02,745
Uh, okay. The fifth dentist caved,
and now they're all recommending Trident?

166
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,129
No, the interview.

167
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,214
She loved me. She absolutely loved me.

168
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:17,093
We talked for, like, two and a half hours.
We have the same taste in clothes.

169
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,345
Oh, I went to camp with her cousin.

170
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,057
And, oh, the job is perfect.
I can do this. I can do this well.

171
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,601
GROUP:
That's great.

172
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,561
God. And she told the funniest story.

173
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,688
Okay, great,
you'll tell us and we'll laugh.

174
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,773
Let's play poker.

175
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,235
All right, listen, we talked about it...

176
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,946
...and if you don't want to play,
we completely understand.

177
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,200
Yes, yes. We can play some other game.
Like, I don't know...

178
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,993
...Pictionary?

179
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,163
Very funny. Very funny.

180
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,790
I think we'd like to give poker another try.
Shall we, ladies?

181
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,459
BOTH:
Yes, I think we should.

182
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,210
Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?

183
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,005
No, no. That's okay. You know what?
I'm gonna give it a go.

184
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,381
ROSS: All right.
-All right.

185
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,562
So Pheebs owes 7.50.
Monica, you owe $10.

186
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,732
And, Rachel, you owe 15 big ones.

187
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,693
Thanks for teaching us
"Crossed-eyed Mary."

188
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,196
You guys, we gotta play that other way.

189
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,660
All right, here's my 7.50, but I think
you should know that this money is cursed.

190
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,287
-What?
-Oh, I cursed it.

191
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,708
So now bad things will happen
to he who spends it.

192
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,587
That's all right, I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

193
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,216
This way, I can break them up
with a movie.

194
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:43,763
So that just leaves the big
Green poker machine, who owes 15.

195
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,140
Hmm, oh, it's so typical:

196
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,768
"Ooh, I'm a man. Ooh, I have a penis.

197
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,814
Ooh, I have to win money
to exert my power over women."

198
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,860
You know what? This is not over.

199
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,281
We will play you again.
And we will win and you will lose.

200
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,199
And you will beg and we will laugh.

201
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,201
And we will take
every last dime you have.

202
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,246
And you will hate yourselves forever.

203
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,334
Hmm. Kind of stepped on
my point there, Mon.

204
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,551
So you gals wanna hand over
your money now?

205
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,846
That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of actually playing.

206
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,976
No, that's fine. We'll see
who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.

207
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,024
Okay, are we done with the chitchat?
Are we ready to play serious poker?

208
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,944
Hey, you guys, look. The one-eyed jack
follows me wherever I go.

209
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,489
Right, okay. Serious poker.

210
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,909
MONICA:
Excuse me. Where are you going?

211
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,411
Uh, to the bathroom.

212
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,955
Do you wanna go to the bathroom
or do you wanna play poker?

213
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,790
I wanna go to the bathroom.

214
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,795
-All right, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
-Oh, no, no, no.

215
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,380
I'm waiting to hear from that job.

216
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,133
And the store closes at 9,
so you can eat then.

217
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,971
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac
to hold me over.

218
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,310
All right. Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody ante.

219
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,312
Yes.

220
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,522
Or no.

221
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,942
ROSS:
All right.

222
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,736
Your money's mine, Green.

223
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,613
Your fly's open, Geller.

224
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,287
You guys, you know what I just realized?

225
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,458
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J."

226
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,420
Coincidence?

227
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,592
Hey, that's "jo-incidence" with a "C."

228
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,606
-Uh, Phoebe. Phoebe....
-Yeah, I'm out.

229
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,650
I'm in.

230
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,026
Me too.

231
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,986
Me too. All right. What do you got?

232
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:09,408
Well, you better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.

233
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,080
Well, well, well.

234
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:18,918
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four sixes.

235
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,130
I got four sixes. I won. I actually won.

236
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,551
Oh, my God. You know what?
I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.

237
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:33,015
I think that one was Ross'.
And I think, oh, that one was Ross'.

238
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,312
Well, I have got your money.
And you'll never see it.

239
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,731
And your fly's still open.

240
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,984
I made you look.

241
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,448
PHOEBE: I'm in.
RACHEL: I couldn't be inner.

242
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,409
PHOEBE:
Monica? Monica, in or out?

243
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,536
I hate this game.

244
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,045
Okay, Joey, your bet.

245
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,465
I fold, like a cheap hooker
who got hit in the stomach...

246
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,510
...by a fat guy with sores on his face.

247
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,473
Oh, I'm out.

248
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,978
-Ross?
-Oh, I'm very in.

249
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,023
-Chandler?
-Couldn't be more out.

250
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,650
Me too. Rachel?

251
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:29,405
Um, I will see you and I'll raise you.

252
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,490
What do you say?
You wanna waste another buck?

253
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,160
No, not this time.

254
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,496
-So, what did you have?
-I'm not telling.

255
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,830
-Come on, show them to me.
-No.

256
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,500
-Show them to me. Let me see.
-Get your hands out of there.

257
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,418
You know, I've had dates like this.

258
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,257
Boy, you really can't stand to lose,
can you?

259
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,926
Your whole face is getting red.

260
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,679
Little veins popping out of your temple.

261
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,266
Plus that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.

262
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,355
First of all, I'm not losing.

263
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,650
-Just deal.
-Hello? Rachel Green.

264
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,695
Excuse me.

265
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,447
It's about the job.

266
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,617
Barbara, hi. How are you?

267
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,120
Uh-huh?

268
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,414
No, I understand.

269
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:26,420
Yeah, oh, come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly.

270
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,967
Yeah. Oh, but you know,
if anything else opens up, please-

271
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,426
Hello?

272
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,388
Hello?

273
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,189
Hmm.

274
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,238
Sorry, Rach.

275
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,615
Yeah, you know,
there's gonna be lots of other stuff.

276
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,451
Yeah. Okay.

277
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,830
Where were we? Oh. Okay.

278
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:05,251
Five card draw. Uh, jacks are better.

279
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,794
Nothing wild, everybody ante.

280
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,755
Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.

281
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,091
Yes, we do.

282
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,804
-All right. Check.
-Check.

283
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,556
I'm in for 50 cents.

284
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,976
-Call.
-I'm in.

285
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,229
I see your 50 cents...

286
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,523
...and I raise you...

287
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,608
...$5.

288
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,194
I thought, uh, it was a 50-cent limit.

289
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,448
Well, I just lost a job,
and I'd like to raise the bet 5 bucks.

290
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,700
Does anybody have a problem with that?

291
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,578
-Not at all.
-No, no.

292
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,250
Loser?

293
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,343
No, I fold.

294
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,220
What do you mean, you fold?
Hey, come on, what is this?

295
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,808
I thought that, "Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy."

296
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,518
I mean, what? Were you just full of it?

297
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,825
I'm in.

298
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,828
-How many you want?
-One.

299
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,248
Dealer takes two.

300
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,543
-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.

301
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,879
Okay.

302
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,798
See your 2...

303
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,467
...and I raise you...

304
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,262
-...20.
-Wow.

305
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,352
I see your 20...

306
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,355
...raise you 25.

307
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,363
See your 25...

308
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,365
...and, uh, Monica, get my purse.

309
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,580
Rachel, there's nothing in it.

310
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,252
Okay, then get me your purse.
