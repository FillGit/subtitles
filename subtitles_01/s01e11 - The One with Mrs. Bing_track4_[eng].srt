1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,546
Do you think they have
yesterday's <i>Daily News?</i>

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,715
MONICA: Why?
-I just wanna check my horoscope...

3
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,508
...see if it was right.

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:13,764
Oh, my God. Phoebe. Don't look now,
but, behind you there's a guy...

5
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,892
...who has the potential to break our hearts
and plunge us into depression.

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,518
Where?

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,104
Ooh, come to Mama.

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,107
Okay, he's coming.
Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.

9
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,568
-Nice hat.
BOTH: Thanks.

10
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,947
-We should do something. Whistle.
-We're not gonna whistle.

11
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,323
-Yeah, come on, do it.
-No.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,492
-Do it. Do it. Do it.
-Woo-hoo!

13
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,333
I can't believe you did that.

14
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,300
MONICA:
<i>Why did I woo-hoo?</i>

15
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,885
I mean, what was I hoping?
He'd turn around and say:

16
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,221
"Ooh, I love that sound.
I must have you now"?

17
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,558
I just wish there was something
we could do.

18
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,479
Hello. Hello, coma guy.

19
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,400
Get up, you Girl Scout! Up, up, up!

20
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,153
-Phoebe, what are you doing?
-Maybe nobody's tried this.

21
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,242
I wish we at least knew his name.

22
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,036
Would you look at that face?

23
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,290
I mean, even sleeping he looks smart.
I bet he's a lawyer.

24
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,918
Yeah, but did you see the dents
in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.

25
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:11,590
Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches
sculpting on the side.

26
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,009
And he can dance.

27
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:18,221
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're talking, he's listening...

28
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,724
...you know, and not saying,
"Yeah, I understand"...

29
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,810
-...but wondering what you look like naked.
-Oh, stop it.

30
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,774
I wish all guys could be like him.

31
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:31,985
I know.

32
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,785
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

33
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,206
-He doesn't have anyone.
-Yeah. We feel kind of responsible.

34
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,501
I can't believe you said, "Woo-hoo."

35
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,586
I don't even say, "Woo-hoo."

36
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,463
Oh, she's coming up. She's coming up.

37
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,672
<i>Folks, when we come back...</i>

38
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,883
<i>...we'll talk about her new book
</i>Euphoria Unbound...

39
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,678
<i>...with always-interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
Put the kids to bed for this one.</i>

40
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,474
Don't watch this. <i>Weekend at Bernie's
</i>is on Showtime and HBO and Cinemex.

41
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,685
-No way.
-Come on. She's your mom.

42
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,938
Exactly. <i>Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

43
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,732
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

44
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,568
-No?
-Chandler, I gotta tell you...

45
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,154
...I love your mom's books.
I love her books.

46
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,157
I cannot get on a plane without one.
I mean, this is so cool.

47
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,284
You wouldn't think it's cool
if you were 11...

48
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,706
...and all your friends were passing around
page 79 of <i>Mistress Bitch.</i>

49
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,875
Come on, Chandler. I love your mom.
I think she's a blast.

50
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,087
-You can say that. She's not your mom.
ROSS: Oh, please. She's the-

51
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,589
RACHEL:
Hi, sweetie.

52
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,136
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?

53
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,013
-Last night.
-Really?

54
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,475
So then his plane didn't explode
in a big ball of fire?

55
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,602
Just a dream I had.

56
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,563
But, phew.

57
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,315
Hey, hey, hey. She's on.

58
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,570
Ah. Nora Bing.

59
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,072
<i>Before we get to the book.</i>

60
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,367
<i>What is this about you being arrested
in London? What is that about?</i>

61
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,955
-Your mom was arrested?
-Shh, I'm busy beaming with pride.

62
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,124
This is kind of embarrassing...

63
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,503
...but occasionally after
I've been intimate with a man-

64
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,965
-Why would she say that's embarrassing?
-Shh.

65
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,552
—I just get this craving
for Kung Pao chicken.

66
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,180
That's too much information.

67
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,478
So now you're doing this book tour thing.
How's that going?

68
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,732
Oh, fine. I'm leaving
for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

69
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,151
But I get to see my son, who I love.

70
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,778
GROUP:
Oh.

71
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,865
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

72
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,036
You know, don't take this wrong,
I just don't see you as a mom somehow.

73
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:50,165
-I don't mean that bad.
-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.

74
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,793
I bought my son his first condoms.

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,176
And then he burst into flames.

76
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:14,147
MONICA: Let's see. "Congress is
debating a new deficit-reduction bill.

77
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,608
The mayor wants to raise
subway fares again.

78
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,402
The high today was 45."

79
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,696
And, oh. And teams played sports.

80
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,017
PHOEBE: What about Glen?
MONICA: No.

81
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,229
-He could be a Glen.
-Mm-mm. Not special enough.

82
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,857
Ooh, how about Agamemnon?

83
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,942
Way too special.

84
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,744
I'm famished. What do I want?

85
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,248
Please, God, don't let it be
Kung Pao chicken.

86
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,334
Oh, you watched the show.
What did you think?

87
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,629
Well, I think you need
to come out of your shell just....

88
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,633
What is this dive?

89
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,803
-Only you could've picked this place.
-Oh.

90
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,346
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.

91
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,015
-Hi.
NORA: Give me a hug.

92
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,977
-Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
-I know I am.

93
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,729
-Who's doing shots?
-Hit me.

94
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,564
-I'm in.
-There you go. Ross?

95
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,650
Uh, I'm not really a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

96
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,527
Hi. Sorry. Sorry we're late.

97
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,323
We, uh, kind of just, you know,
lost track of time.

98
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,660
But a man can change.

99
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,835
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

100
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,182
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you,
I've read everything you've ever written.

101
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,559
No, I mean it.
When I read <i>Euphoria at Midnight...</i>

102
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,478
...all I wanted to do was become a writer.

103
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,481
Oh, please, honey.
If I can do it, anybody can.

104
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,359
You just start with half a dozen
European cities...

105
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,986
...throw in 30 euphemisms
for male genitalia...

106
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,864
...and, bam, you have got yourself
a book.

107
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,576
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.

108
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,707
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

109
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,253
-You okay, slugger?
-Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

110
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,601
What is with you tonight?

111
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,729
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

112
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,940
NORA:
Okay, thank you.

113
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,529
It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?

114
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,573
No. It's the one he's licking.

115
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,159
She's supposed to be with you.

116
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,370
You're good.

117
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,166
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold
100 million copies of my books...

118
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,459
...and you know why?

119
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,586
The girl on the cover
with her nipples showing?

120
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:31,428
No, because I know how to write men
that women fall in love with.

121
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,596
Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo.

122
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,058
People will not turn 325 pages
for a Paolo.

123
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,977
Come on.
The guy's a secondary character.

124
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,981
He's just a- You know, a complication
you eventually kill off.

125
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,526
When?

126
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,364
He's not a hero.

127
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,199
You know who our hero is?

128
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,077
The guy on the cover
with his nipples showing?

129
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,413
No, it's you.

130
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,206
-Please.
-No, really.

131
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,584
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

132
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,170
-Right.
-Oh, come on, kiddo.

133
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,006
You're gonna be fine, believe me.

134
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,012
Uh-oh.

135
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,736
Uh, I'll just pee in the street.

136
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,289
Is Chandler here?

137
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,374
-Yeah.
-Wait. Come here.

138
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,419
Okay, uh, about last night...

139
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,171
...um, you know...

140
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,298
...Chandler. You didn't tell....

141
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,509
Okay, I'm thinking
we don't need to tell Chandler.

142
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,969
It was just a kiss. One kiss.
No big deal, right?

143
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,055
-Right. No big deal.
-Okay.

144
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,932
In Bizarro-world.

145
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,561
You broke the code.

146
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,689
-What code?
-You don't kiss your friend's mom.

147
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,527
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

148
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,695
But not a mom. Never a mom.

149
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,659
What are you guys doing out here?

150
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,704
Uh, well, Joey and I had discussed getting
in an early morning racquetball game.

151
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,251
But, urn,
apparently somebody overslept.

152
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,130
Yeah, well, you don't have your racquet.

153
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,423
No. No, I don't,
because it's being restrung.

154
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,385
Ahem. Somebody was supposed
to bring me one.

155
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,347
Yeah. Well, you didn't call
and leave your grip size.

156
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,811
Okay, you guys are spending
way too much time together.

157
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,357
Okay, I'm scum. I'm scum.

158
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,985
-Ross, how could you let this happen?
-I don't know.

159
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,197
Well, it's not like she's a regular mom.
You know? She's sexy. She's....

160
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,491
You don't think my mom's sexy?

161
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,537
Well, not in the same way.

162
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,622
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani...

163
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,749
...was a handsome woman in her day,
all right?

164
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,296
You think it's easy giving birth
to seven children?

165
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,755
Huh?

166
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,467
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

167
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,344
-Aah.
-Hey.

168
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,138
-Hey.
-What are you guys doing out here?

169
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,474
Well, ha, ha, not playing racquetball.

170
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,688
-He forgot to leave his grip size.
-He didn't get the goggles.

171
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,690
Oh. Right.

172
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,527
Well, sounds like you two have issues.

173
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,239
Goodbye, baby.

174
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,536
Do they wait for me to do this?

175
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,544
-So are you gonna tell him?
-I'm not gonna tell him.

176
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,963
-Why would I tell him?
-How about, because if you don't...

177
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,257
-...his mother might?
-Hmm.

178
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,551
What are you guys doing here?

179
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,846
Uh, he's not even wearing a jock strap.

180
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,270
What did I ask?

181
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,450
-Hi.
-Hi.

182
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,453
What are you doing here?

183
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,456
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after the, ahem....

184
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,334
That I, you know.
Um, so, what are you doing here?

185
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,171
I'm not really here.

186
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:39,968
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

187
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,556
Do you, um, come here a lot...

188
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,266
...without me?

189
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,228
No, no, no.

190
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,192
So, um, do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

191
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,321
How would I know? I wasn't here.

192
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,950
Really? Not even to,
um, change his pajamas?

193
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,830
Oh, my God.

194
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,874
You're my friend. I had to tell you.

195
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,793
I can't believe it.

196
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,045
Paolo kissed my mom?

197
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,675
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you noticed,
but he had a lot to drink.

198
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,511
I mean, you know how he gets
when he's drunk-

199
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,265
I can't do this. I did it.

200
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,976
It was me. I'm sorry. I kissed your mom.

201
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,769
What?

202
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,481
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo
and I think I had too much tequila...

203
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,776
...and Nora- Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was....

204
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,156
She was just being nice, you know?
But nothing happened.

205
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,950
Nothing. Ask Joey. Joey came in-

206
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,827
-You knew about this?
-Uh....

207
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,204
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

208
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,958
I spent the entire day with you.
Why didn't you tell me?

209
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,252
Hey, hey. You're lucky
I caught them when I did...

210
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,171
...or else who knows
what would've happened?

211
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,839
Thanks, man. Big help.

212
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,467
I can't believe this.
What the hell were you thinking?

213
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,761
I wasn't. I don't know. I-

214
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,264
Of all my friends, no one knows the crap
I go through with my mom more than you.

215
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,767
-I know.
-I can't believe you did this.

216
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,227
-Me neither.
-I'm mad at you for not telling me.

217
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,773
-What are you mad at me-?
-Let me slam the door.

218
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,359
Chandler, I didn't kiss her. He did.

219
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,152
See what happens
when you break the code?

220
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,196
-Joey.
-Aah! Uh.

221
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,707
-Rach.
-Hey.

222
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,044
<i>"A Woman Undone.
</i>By Rachel Karen Green."

223
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,631
Yeah, I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm still on the first chapter.

224
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:46,969
Now, do you think his "love stick"
can be "liberated from its denim prison"?

225
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,723
Yeah, I'd say so.

226
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,143
And there's no "J" in "engorged."

227
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,188
-Hey, Rach.
-Hey.

228
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,107
-Hello.
-Hello.

229
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,276
-You going to the hospital tonight?
-No. You?

230
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,112
No. You?

231
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,658
You just asked me.

232
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,910
Okay, maybe it was a trick question.

233
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,873
-Um, Rachel, can we do this now?
-Okay.

234
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,252
I am so hot.

235
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,506
And here's a picture of my mother
and father on their wedding day.

236
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,509
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

237
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,054
I cannot believe
we're having this conversation.

238
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,807
Come on, just try to picture her
not pregnant. That's all.

239
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,396
Central Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

240
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,774
PHOEBE:
Thanks.

241
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,693
Hi. Um, ahem. Okay.

242
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,196
I'd like to start with a song
that's about a man I recently met...

243
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,575
...who's, um, come to be
very important to me.

244
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,203
Okay.

245
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,668
<i>You don't have to be awake
To be my man</i>

246
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:07,884
<i>Long as you have brain waves
I'll be there to hold your hand</i>

247
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,721
<i>Though we just met the other day</i>

248
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,183
<i>There's something I have got to say</i>

249
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,312
Okay, thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

250
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,234
RACHEL: Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay,
everybody. Whoo!

251
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,197
-What the hell was that?
-Phoebe just started-

252
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,992
I believe I was talking to Joey.
All right, there, mother-kisser?

253
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,124
"Mother-kisser."

254
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,793
I'll shut up.

255
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,588
Chandler, can I say something?
I know you're still mad at me.

256
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,966
I just wanna say that there were
two people there that night, okay?

257
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,053
-There were two sets of lips.
-Yes, well, I expect this from her.

258
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,972
Okay? She's always been
a Freudian nightmare.

259
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,351
Okay, but if she always behaves like this,
why don't you say something?

260
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,395
Because it's complicated. It's complex.

261
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,231
Hey, you kissed my mom.

262
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,445
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

263
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,573
-That's funny. We done now?
-No.

264
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,993
Okay, you mean you're not gonna
talk to her, tell her how you feel?

265
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,455
That would be a no. Just because
you played tonsil tennis with my mom...

266
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,833
...doesn't mean you know her, all right?
Trust me, you can't talk to her.

267
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,378
Okay. "You can't"? Or you can't?

268
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:30,967
Okay, that's my finger.
Okay, that's my knee.

269
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,927
Still doing the play.

270
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,770
All right, what did you do with him?

271
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,943
-You're awake.
-Look at you.

272
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,111
How do you feel?

273
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,364
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.

274
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,574
Gosh, you look good.

275
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,535
I feel good.

276
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,912
Who are you?

277
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,747
-Sorry.
-I'm Phoebe Buffay.

278
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,500
I'm Monica Geller.
I've been taking care of you.

279
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,668
We both have.

280
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,838
-So the Etch A Sketch is from you guys?
-Actually, it's just from me.

281
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,924
-Yeah, I got you the foot massager.
-Know who shaved you? That was me.

282
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,011
-I read to you.
-I sang. Ha.

283
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,972
Well, thanks.

284
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,391
-Oh, my pleasure.
-You're welcome.

285
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,519
So I guess I'll see you around.

286
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,355
What? That's it?

287
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,607
"See you around"?

288
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,069
-Well, what do you want me to say?
-Well, I don't know.

289
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,571
Maybe, uh:

290
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,114
"That was nice.

291
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,741
It meant something to me.

292
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,869
I'll call you."

293
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:44,040
-All right. I'll call you.
-I don't think you mean that.

294
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,378
This is so typical.

295
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,671
You know, we give...

296
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,298
...and we give...

297
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,008
...and we give.

298
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,469
And then we just get nothing back.

299
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,473
And then one day, it's just, you know,
you wake up and "See you around."

300
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,560
Let's go, Phoebe.

301
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,898
You know what?
We thought you were different.

302
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,359
But I guess it was just the coma.

303
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,615
NORA:
<i>The car's running downstairs.</i>

304

00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:25,581
-Anything you want from Lisbon?
-No, just knowing you're there is enough.

306
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,835
All right. Well, be good. I love you.

307
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,131
You kissed my best Ross.

308
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,552
Or something to that effect.

309
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,847
Okay.

310
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,645
Look, it was stupid.

311
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,189
-Really stupid.
-Really stupid.

312
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,693
And I don't even know how it happened.

313
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,739
I'm sorry, honey.
I promise it will never happen again.

314
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,035
-Are we okay now?
-Yeah.

315
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,497
No. No.

316
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,962
Ah, the forbidden love
of a man and his door.

317
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,380
Shh.

318
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,467
He did it. He told her off. And not just
about the kiss, about everything.

319
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,677
-You're kidding?
-No.

320
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,513
He said, "When are you gonna
grow up and start being a mom?"

321
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,765
-Wow.
-Wait, then she came back with:

322
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:29,478
"The question is, when are you gonna
grow up and realize I have a bomb?"

323
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,107
Okay, wait. Are you sure she didn't say:

324
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:37,111
"When are you gonna grow up
and realize I am your mom?"

325
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,825
-That makes more sense.
-You think?

326
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,535
Yeah.

327
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,787
So, what's going on now?

328
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,999
I don't know. I've been standing here
spelling it out for you.

329
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,336
I don't hear anything. Wait, wait, wait.

330
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,713
What do you see?

331
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,299
It's hard to tell.
They're so tiny and upside down.

332
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,800
Wait, wait, wait.

333
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,387
They're walking away.
They're walking away.

334
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,974
No, they're not. They're coming
right at us. Run, run!

335
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,811
You okay, kiddo?

336
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,231
-Yeah, I'm okay.
-All right. You be good.

337
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,150
Drive safe.

338
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,780
-Mrs. Bing.
-Mr. Geller.

339
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,203
Hey.

340
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,623
You mean that?

341
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,459
Yeah, why not?

342
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,879
-So I told her.
-Oh.

343
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,590
-How did it go?
-Awful. Awful.

344
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,675
Couldn't have gone worse.

345
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,262
-Well, how do you feel?
-Pretty good.

346
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,849
I told her.

347
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,018
Well, see?

348
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:55,356
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,
you know, me kissing your mom, huh?

349
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,025
But we don't have to go down that road.

350
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,659
Now, this is just the first chapter...

351
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:11,956
...and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?

352
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:16,835
Oh, and on page two, he's not reaching
for her "heaving beasts."

353
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,963
What's a "niffle"?

354
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,132
You can usually find them
on the heaving beasts.

355
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,512
All right, all right,
so I'm not a great typist.

356
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,724
Wait, did you get to the part
about his "huge, throbbing pens"?

357
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,812
Tell you, you don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those.

358
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,107
-All right, that's it. Give them back.
GROUP: No.
