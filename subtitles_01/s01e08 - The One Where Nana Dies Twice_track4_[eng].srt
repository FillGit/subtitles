1
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,135
Hey, gorgeous. How's it going?

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,388
Dehydrated Japanese noodles
under fluorescent lights.

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,891
Does it get better than this?

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,019
Question: You're not dating, are you?

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,855
I met somebody who would be
perfect for you.

6
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,441
You see, perfect might be a problem.

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,237
Had you said co-dependent
or self-destructive....

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,198
-You want a date Saturday?
-Yes, please.

9
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,326
He is cute.

10
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,745
-He's funny. He's-
-He's a he?

11
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,372
Well, yeah.

12
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,208
Oh, God. I just-

13
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,627
You're nice- Oh, God.

14
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,673
Good, Shelly. Okay. I'm gonna go
flush myself down the toilet now.

15
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,049
Okay. Bye-bye.

16
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:41,101
CHANDLER: It's hard to enjoy noodles
after that. Is that ridiculous?

17
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,937
Can you believe she actually
thought that?

18
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,647
Urn....

19
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,024
Yeah.

20
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,903
Well, when I first met you,
I thought maybe...

21
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,238
...possibly...

22
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,531
...you might be.

23
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,658
You did?

24
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,245
Then you spent Phoebe's birthday
party talking to my breasts...

25
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,289
...so then I figured maybe not.

26
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:08,962
Huh. Did, uh, any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?

27
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,297
-I did.
-I think so.

28
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,052
-Not me.
-No, no, me neither.

29
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,222
Although, uh, back in college,
Susan Saladore did.

30
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,932
You're kidding.

31
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,518
-Did you tell her I wasn't?
-No.

32
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,356
It's because I wanted
to go out with her too.

33
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,984
So I told her, actually,
you were seeing Bernie Spellman...

34
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,821
...who also liked her.

35
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,703
Well, this is fascinating.

36
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,206
So, uh, what is it about me?

37
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:48,168
I don't know. Because you're smart,
you're funny....

38
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,754
Ross is smart and funny.
You ever think that about him?

39
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,673
-Ha, ha. Yeah, right.
-What is it?

40
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,929
Okay, I don't know. You just-
You have a quality.

41
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,555
-Yes, exactly.
-Right?

42
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,224
Yeah, a quality.

43
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:06,520
"A quality." Good. I was worried
you were gonna be vague about this.

44
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,981
Hello?

45
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,775
Hello?

46
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,860
Oh. Rachel.

47
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,737
It's Paolo calling from Rome.

48
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,907
Oh, my God. Calling from Rome.

49
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,998
So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.

50
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,167
Just gotta go to Rome.

51
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,715
Monica, your dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?

52
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,550
I'm talking to Rome.

53
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,010
I'm talking to Rome.

54
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,722
Hey, Dad. What's up?

55
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,891
Oh, God.

56
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,978
Ross, it's Nana.

57
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,612
Hey.

58
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,450
MONICA: How you doing?
ROSS: Hey, Dad.

59
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,329
So, uh, how's she doing?

60
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,499
The doctor says
it's a matter of hours.

61
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,878
-How are you, Mom?
-Me? I'm fine, fine.

62
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,963
I'm glad you're here.

63
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,049
What's with your hair?

64
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,426
What?

65
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,011
What's different?

66
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,387
Nothing.

67
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,973
Oh, maybe that's it.

68
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,350
She's unbelievable.
Her mother's-

69
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,852
Okay, relax, relax.

70
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,605
We are gonna be here a while,
it looks like.

71
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,649
We still have boyfriends
and your career to cover.

72
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,234
Oh, God.

73
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,160
The fuzzy little mints
at the bottom of her purse.

74
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,828
Oh.

75
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,414
Yeah, they were gross.

76
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,042
Oh, you know what I love?

77
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,085
Her Sweet 'N Lows.

78
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,506
How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.

79
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,800
Not just restaurants,
from our house.

80
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,385
Mrs. Geller?

81
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,726
ROSS:
She looks so small.

82
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,228
I know.

83
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,815
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
and Aunt Phyllis now.

84
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,154
Goodbye, Nana.

85
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,329
Bye, Nana.

86
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,292
Ross!

87
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,087
Nurse.

88
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,923
What is going on?

89
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,552
You know, uh, how the nurse said
Nana had passed?

90
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,303
Well, she's not quite.

91
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,140
-What?
-She's not passed.

92
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,768
She's present. She's back.

93
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,270
What's going on?

94
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,188
She may have died.

95
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,315
"She may have died"?

96
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,859
We're looking into it.

97
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,362
Uh, I'll go see.

98
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,158
This almost never happens.

99
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,761
Now she's passed.

100
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,690
I just have to know, okay?

101
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,525
Is it my hair?

102
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,154
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.

103
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,573
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

104
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,579
RACHEL: Hey.
MONICA: Hi.

105
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,789
RACHEL:
So did she...?

106
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,666
Twice.

107
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,503
Oh, that sucks.

108
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,882
You guys okay?

109
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,967
I don't know. It's weird.

110
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,721
I know she's gone,
but I just don't feel, uh....

111
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,932
Maybe that's because
she's not really gone.

112
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,642
No, no, she's gone.

113
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,852
We checked.

114
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,354
A lot.

115
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,608
No, I mean, maybe no one
ever really goes.

116
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,736
Ever since my mom died,
every now and then...

117
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,740
...I get this feeling that she's,
like, right here, you know?

118
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,330
Oh. And Debbie, my best friend
from junior high...

119
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,667
...got struck by lightning
on a miniature golf course.

120
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,462
I always get this strong
Debbie vibe...

121
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,131
...whenever I use
one of those little yellow pencils.

122
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,096
I miss her.

123
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,515
Aw. Here, Pheebs.

124
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,849
Want this?

125
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,060
-Oh, thanks.
-Sure.

126
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,521
I just sharpened her this morning.

127
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,943
See, I don't believe any of that.
I think when you're dead...

128
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,696
...you're dead. You're gone.
You're worm food.

129
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,702
So Chandler looks gay, huh?

130
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,792
I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.

131
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,385
I thought it'd be a closed casket.

132
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,555
Well, that doesn't mean
she can't look nice.

133
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,062
Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?

134
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,189
I don't see why not.

135
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,543
ROSS:
Here's my retainer.

136
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,763
I was just thinking...

137
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,973
-...when my time comes—
-Dad.

138
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,433
Listen to me.

139
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,897
When my time comes,
I wanna be buried at sea.

140
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,525
You what?

141
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,654
I wanna be buried at sea.
It looks like fun.

142
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,241
Define "fun."

143
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,579
Come on. You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch....

144
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:44,209
And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

145
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,919
Everyone thinks they know me.

146
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,255
Everyone says, "Jack Geller,
so predictable."

147
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:54,260
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,
"Buried at sea? Huh."

148
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,724
That's probably what they'll say.

149
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,851
I'd like that.

150
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,949
-Hey, gorgeous.
-Hey.

151
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,077
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

152
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,623
Don't worry about it. Apparently,
other people have made the same mistake.

153
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,584
Oh. Okay. Phew.

154
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,090
So, uh, what do you think it is about me?

155
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,467
I don't know what.

156
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,553
You just have...

157
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,638
-...a quality.
-A quality. Right. Great.

158
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,851
It's a shame, because you and Lowell
would've made a great couple.

159
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,815
Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?
That's who you saw me with?

160
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,191
What? He's cute.

161
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,776
Well, yeah.

162
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,195
He's no Brian in Payroll.

163
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,241
Is Brian...?

164
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,995
No. I don't know. The point is,
if you were gonna set me up...

165
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,081
...I'd like to think it'd be
with somebody like him.

166
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,792
Well, I think Brian's
a little out of your league.

167
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,843
Excuse me. You don't think
I could get a Brian?

168
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,099
Because I could get a Brian.
Believe you me.

169
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,269
I'm really not.

170
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,730
ROSS:
This one?

171
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,066
No.

172
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,695
I've shown you every dress we have.

173
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,866
Unless you want her to spend eternity
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit...

174
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,243
...go with the burgundy.

175
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,205
Whatever we pick, she would've
told us it's the wrong one.

176
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,625
You're right.
We'll go with the burgundy.

177
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,628
A fine choice. I'm coming out.

178
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,546
Wait. We need shoes.

179
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,845
Okay. Uh....

180
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,097
How about these?

181
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,475
That's really a day shoe.

182
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,811
And where she's going,
everyone else will be dressier?

183
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,315
Could we see something
in a slimmer heel?

184
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:21,658
Okay. I have nothing in an evening shoe
in the burgundy.

185
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,411
I can show you something
in a silver that may work.

186
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,623
No, it really should be burgundy.

187
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,167
-Unless we go with a different dress.
-Yes.

188
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,378
No, no, no. Watch this.

189
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,839
Wait, I may have something in the back.

190
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,853
Oh, my God.

191
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,022
Is everything all right, dear?

192
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,066
Yeah. Yeah.

193
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,027
Just Nana's stuff.

194
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,547
How we doing?
You guys ready?

195
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,550
Mom called to remind me
not to wear my hair up.

196
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,136
Did you know my ears were not
my best feature?

197
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,638
Some days it's all I can think about.

198
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,517
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find my bearings.

199
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,602
Heh. You mean your earrings?

200
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,396
What did I say?

201
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,943
-Are these the shoes?
-Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.

202
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,238
What? We, uh, don't have shoes here?

203
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,242
Morning. We ready to go?

204
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,453
Don't we look nice all dressed up?

205
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,457
It's stuff like that, isn't it?

206
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,513
-It was a beautiful service.
-It really was.

207
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,309
Come here, sweetheart.

208
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,605
You know...

209
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,650
...I think it's time for you
to start using night cream.

210
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,824
What?

211
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,578
Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds
remarkably like Brent Musburger.

212
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,373
Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.

213
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,585
You're watching football at a funeral?

214
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,547
No, it's the pregame.
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

215
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,884
You're a frightening, frightening man.

216
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,471
RACHEL:
Oh, no. My new Paolo shoes.

217
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,140
Oh. I hope they're not ruined.

218
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,480
PHOEBE:
God, what a great day.

219
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,358
What? Weatherwise.

220
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,194
I know.

221
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,280
The air, the trees.

222
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,952
Even though Nana's gone,
there's something almost, uh, life—

223
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,914
-Ross, are you okay?
-Ross!

224
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,499
I'm fine. No, I'm fine.

225
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,293
Just...

226
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,921
...having my worst fear
realized, but....

227
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,349
PHOEBE: I'm just checking to see
if the muscle's in spasm.

228
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,768
-Huh.
-What? What is it?

229
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,562
-You missed a belt loop.
-Ugh.

230
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,941
Okay, it's in spasm.

231
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,819
Here, sweetie. Here.

232
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,196
I took these when I had
my golfing accident.

233
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,489
Thanks, Mom.

234
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,040
ANDREA:
Sorry.

235
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,501
Hi, I'm Andrea.

236
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,879
I'm Dorothy's daughter.

237
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,632
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have
no idea who Dorothy is.

238
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,179
PHOEBE:
Hey, look who's up.

239
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,473
-Hey.
-How do you feel?

240
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,350
I feel great.

241
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,271
I feel great. I feel great.

242
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,816
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?

243
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,111
Yeah. Not the first two,
but the second two, whew.

244
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,366
I love you guys.

245
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,413
You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.

246
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,874
I love Pheebs. Ha.

247
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,043
-That's so nice.
-Hey.

248
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,670
-Chandler.
-Hey.

249
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,880
I love you, man.

250
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,218
And listen,
if you wanna be gay, be gay.

251
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,139
It doesn't matter to me.

252
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:57,934
You were right.

253
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,109
Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.

254
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,324
I love you the most.

255
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,371
Well, you know who I love the most?

256
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,123
-No.
-You.

257
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,253
Oh, you don't get it.

258
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,969
-Aw!
-What do you got there?

259
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,389
Uh, just a, uh, hearing disability.

260
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,391
What's the score?

261
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,104
17-14, Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.

262
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,397
Beautiful.

263
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,742
Pheebs, could you maybe
hand me a cracker?

264
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,330
Your grandmother would've hated this.

265
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,334
Well, sure. What with it
being her funeral and all.

266
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,922
No, I'd be hearing about...

267
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,842
...why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham?

268
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,679
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
If I spent more, she'd say:

269
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:20,308
"Why waste your money?
I don't need flowers, I'm dead."

270
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,935
That sounds like Nana.

271
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,981
Do you know what it's like
to grow up...

272
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:31,944
...with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?

273
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,740
I can imagine.

274
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,827
I tell you, it's a wonder
your mother turned out...

275
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,205
...to be the positive,
life-affirming person she is.

276
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,001
That is a wonder.

277
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:54,383
So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again...

278
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,678
...I mean, if she was here right now...

279
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,430
...would you tell her?

280
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,057
Tell her what?

281
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:07,021
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.

282
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,315
Like your hair, for example.

283
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,778
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

284
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,824
Would things have been better
if you'd just told her the truth?

285
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,746
No.

286
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,084
I think some things are
better left unsaid.

287
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,212
I think it's nicer when people
just get along.

288
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,132
Ha.

289
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,425
More wine, dear?

290
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,511
Oh, I think so.

291
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,438
Those earrings look
really lovely on you.

292
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,858
Thank you.

293
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:54,944
They're yours.

294
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,947
Actually, they were Nana's.

295
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,158
MEN:
No!

296
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,370
Now I'm depressed.

297
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,043
Even more than I was.

298
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,845
Hey, who's this little naked guy?

299
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,180
Uh, that little naked guy would be me.

300
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,559
Aw. Look at the little thing.

301
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,981
Yes, fine.
That is my penis.

302
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,608
Can we be grownups now?

303
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,820
-Who are those people?
-Got me.

304
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:41,574
-That's Nana right there in the middle.
-Wow.

305
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,908
Yeah, let's see.

306
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,828
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."

307
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,205
Wow. Monica, you look just like
your grandmother.

308
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,623
How old was she there?

309
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,750
Let's see. "1939."

310
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,003
Uh, twenty-four, twenty-five.

311
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,089
Huh. It looks like a fun gang.

312
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,140
Ooh, look, look, look.
I got Monica naked.

313
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,850
Let me see.

314
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,354
No, no. That would be me again.

315
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,570
I'm, uh, just trying something.

316
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,750
-Hey, Lowell.
-Oh, hey, Chandler.

317
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,421
So how's it going in
Financial Services?

318
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,966
It's like Mardi Gras without
the papier-mache heads.

319
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,301
How about you?

320
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,180
Good. Good. Listen, um, heh...

321
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,475
...I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but, uh...

322
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:51,977
...I'm not.

323
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,314
I know. That's what I told her.

324
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,982
-Really?
-Yeah.

325
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,069
So you can tell?

326
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:06,325
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.

327
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,037
So you don't think I have...

328
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,247
...a quality?

329
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:16,085
Speaking for my people,
I'd have to say no.

330
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,882
By the way, your friend Brian
from Payroll? He is.

331
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,509
-He is?
-Yep.

332
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,636
And way out of your league.

333
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,975
Out of my league.

334
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:35,354
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.

335
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,439
Hey, Brian.
