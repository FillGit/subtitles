1
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:11,428
Guys? There's, uh, somebody
I'd like you to meet.

2
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,641
Wait, wait. What is that?

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,517
That would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,019
No. No, I don't.

5
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,313
Oh, he is precious.
Where did you get him?

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,607
My friend Bethel rescued him
from some lab.

7
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,317
That is so cruel.

8
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:28,654
Why? Why would a parent
name their child Bethel?

9
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,700
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross
on his ass.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,959
Ross, is he gonna live with you,
like, in your apartment?

11
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,337
Yeah. I mean, it's been kind of quiet
since Carol left, so....

12
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,339
Why don't you just get a roommate?

13
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,549
Ah, I don't know.
You reach a certain age...

14
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,843
...having a roommate
is just kind of pathe-

15
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,934
Uh, sorry, that's "pathet," which is Sanskrit
for "really cool way to live."

16
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,738
You guys,
I'm doing all-new material tonight.

17
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,365
I have 12 new songs
about my mother's suicide...

18
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,784
...and one about a snowman.

19
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,039
Might want to open with the snowman.

20
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,417
GROUP: Hey, Joey.
-Hey.

21
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,628
ROSS: Hey, Joe.
-So how'd it go?

22
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,380
Ah, I didn't get the job.

23
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,301
How could you not get it?
You were Santa last year.

24
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,556
I don't know. Some fat guy's
sleeping with the store manager.

25
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,559
He's not even jolly. It's all political.

26
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,978
So, what are you gonna be?

27
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,147
I'm gonna be one of his helpers.

28
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,317
It's just such a slap in the face,
you know?

29
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,569
Do you guys know what you're doing
for New Year's?

30
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,824
Gee, what?
What is wrong with New Year's?

31
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,576
Nothing for you. You have Paolo.

32
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,287
You don't have to face
the horrible pressures of this holiday...

33
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,498
...desperate scramble
to find anything with lips...

34
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,377
...just so can have somebody to kiss
when the ball drops. Man, I'm talking loud.

35
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,757
Well, for your information, Paolo's
gonna be in Rome this New Year's.

36
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,967
So I'll be just as pathetic
as the rest of you.

37
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,178
Yeah, you wish.

38
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,100
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim
of this Dick Clark holiday.

39
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,685
I say this year, no dates, we make a pact.

40
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,854
Just the six of us. Dinner.

41
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,898
-Sure.
-Fine.

42
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,442
You know, I was hoping
for a little more enthusiasm.

43
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,819
-Woo!
-Okay.

44
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,781
-Phoebe, you're on.
-Oh. Oh, good.

45
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,785
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen,
back by popular demand...

46
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,121
...Miss Phoebe Buffay.

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,793
Thanks. Hi.

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,589
Um, ahem, I want to start with a song
that means a lot to me this time of year.

49
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,098
<i>/ made a man with eyes of coal</i>

50
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,893
<i>And a smile so bewitchin'</i>

51
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,938
<i>How was I supposed to know</i>

52
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,858
<i>That my mom was dead in the kitchen?</i>

53
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,156
<i>La-la-la</i>

54
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,742
<i>My mother's ashes</i>

55
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,163
<i>Even her eyelashes</i>

56
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:13,336
<i>Are resting in a little yellow jar</i>

57
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,507
<i>-And sometimes when it's freezing
</i>DAVID: I'm being honest here.

58
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,675
You don't agree.

59
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,052
<i>-/ feel a little sneezy
</i>MAX: You're right.

60
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,680
<i>And now I-
</i>Excuse me? Excuse me?

61
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,599
Yeah, noisy boys.

62
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,270
Is it something that you'd like
to share with the group?

63
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,858
No. No, that's okay.

64
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,111
Come on, if it's important enough
to discuss while I'm playing...

65
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,281
...then I assume it's important enough
for everyone else to hear.

66
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,950
That guy's going home with a note.

67
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,958
-Nothing. I was just saying-
-Could you speak up?

68
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,335
Sorry.

69
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,215
I was just saying to my friend, you were
the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

70
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,384
-And you said Daryl Hannah...
-Darryl Hannah.

71
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,638
...was the most beautiful woman
that he'd ever seen in his life.

72
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,058
And I said, yeah, I liked her in <i>Splash,
</i>but not so much in <i>Wall Street.</i>

73
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,019
-I thought she had a hard quality.
-A hard quality.

74
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,732
And, uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful
in a conventional way...

75
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,402
...you are, uh, luminous
with a kind of delicate grace.

76
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,242
Then that's when you started yelling.

77
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,460
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.

78
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,342
I think that guy's going home
with more than a note.

79
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,391
ROSS:
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

80
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,855
Pheebs, I can't believe
he hasn't kissed you yet.

81
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,816
I mean, God, by my sixth date
with Paolo...

82
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,944
...I mean, he had already named
both my breasts.

83
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,158
Ooh, did I just share too much?

84
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,953
Just a smidge.

85
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,207
David's, like, you know, a scientist guy.
He's very methodical.

86
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,210
-I think it's romantic.
-Me too. Oh!

87
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,421
Did you ever see
<i>An Officer and a Gentleman?</i>

88
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,630
MONICA:
Yeah.

89
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,301
Well, he's kind of like the guy
I went to see that with.

90
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,971
Except....

91
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,143
Except he's smarter and gentler
and sweeter.

92
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,396
I just- I just want to be with him
all the time.

93
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,275
You know, day and night.
And night and day.

94
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,028
And special occasions.

95
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,491
Wait a minute. I see where this is going.
You're gonna ask him to New Year's.

96
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,952
You're gonna break the pact.
She's gonna break the pact.

97
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,121
No, no, no.

98
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,207
Yeah, could I just...?

99
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,670
-Yeah, because I already asked Janice.
RACHEL: You what?

100
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,465
Come on, this was a pact.
This was your pact.

101
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,301
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle
the pressure and I snapped.

102
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,554
Yeah, but Janice?
That was, like, the worst breakup in history.

103
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,265
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I'm saying I snapped.

104
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,354
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.

105
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,073
Too many jokes.

106
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,575
Must mock Joey.

107
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,246
Nice shoes, huh?

108
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,874
Aah, you're killing me.

109
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,796
Ross.
He's playing with my spatulas again.

110
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,799
Look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

111
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,968
Do you always have to bring him here?

112
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,429
Look, I didn't want to leave him alone,
all right?

113
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,140
We had our first fight this morning.

114
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,897
I think it has to do with my working late.
I said some things that I didn't mean.

115
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,193
He threw some feces.

116
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,282
You know, if you're gonna work late,
I can look in on him for you.

117
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,451
Oh, that would be great. Okay.

118
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,080
But if you do, make sure it seems
like you're there to see him, okay?

119
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,791
And you're not, like, doing it
as a favor to me.

120
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,003
Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.

121
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,137
But you can't actually test this theory.

122
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,765
Because today's particle accelerators
are nowhere near powerful enough...

123
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,852
...to simulate these conditions.

124
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,646
-Okay. All right. I have a question then.
-Yeah.

125
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,815
Were you planning on kissing me ever?

126
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,071
Uh, that's definitely a valid question...

127
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,449
...and, uh, the answer...

128
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,909
...would be yes.

129
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,661
Yes, I was.

130
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:04,169
But see, I wanted it to be
this phenomenal kiss...

131
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,297
...that happened at this phenomenal
moment because, well, it's you.

132
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,715
Sure. Yeah.

133
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,927
Right. But, see, the longer I waited,
the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.

134
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,512
And now, we've reached a place...

135
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,265
...where it's just got to be
one of those things where I...

136
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,310
...sweep everything off the table
and throw you down on it.

137
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,521
And I'm not really
a sweeping sort of fella.

138
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,859
Oh, David, I think you are
a sweeping sort of fella.

139
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:32,280
I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

140
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,033
-Really.
-Oh, yeah. I'm sure of it.

141
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,952
You should just do it.
Just sweep and throw me. Heh.

142
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,541
-Now? Now?
-Right now. Just....

143
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,918
Okay. Okay, okay.

144
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,382
You know what?
This is just really expensive.

145
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,011
Okay. And I'll tell you, this was a gift.

146
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,098
-So now you're just kind of tidying up.
-Okay, what the hell? What the hell?

147
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,022
-You want me to actually throw you-?
-I can hop.

148
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:26,251
Now, tell me something, what does
the phase "no-date pact" mean to you?

149
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,544
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

150
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,296
It's just that Chandler has somebody
and Phoebe has somebody.

151
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,674
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

152
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,968
-Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend, Fun Bobby?
-Yeah.

153
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,846
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

154
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,848
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

155
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,685
Okay. Here we go.

156
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,521
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's no room for milk.

157
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,862
There. Now there is.

158
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,155
Okay, so on our no-date evening...

159
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,491
...three of you now
are gonna have dates.

160
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,826
-Uh, four.
-Four.

161
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,619
-Five.
-Five.

162
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,789
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.

163
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,710
Yeah, and I met this really hot
single mom at the store. Ha, ha.

164
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,212
What's an elf to do?

165
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,591
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one
standing there alone...

166
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,842
...when the ball drops?

167
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,929
Oh, come on. We'll have a big party,
and no one will know who's with who.

168
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,181
Hey, you know,
this is so not what I needed now.

169
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,018
-What's the matter?
-Oh, it's Marcel.

170
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,647
He keeps shutting me out, you know?

171
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,443
He's walking around all the time,
dragging his hands.

172
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,113
That's so weird. I had such a blast
with him the other night.

173
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,407
-Really?
-Yeah, we played. We watched TV.

174
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,118
That juggling thing is amazing.

175
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,078
What, uh...?

176
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,123
What juggling thing?

177
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,793
With the balled-up socks?
I figured you taught him that.

178
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,879
No.

179
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,799
You know, it wasn't that big a deal.
I mean, just balled-up socks.

180
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,009
And a melon.

181
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,641
-Phoebe. Hi.
-Hi, Max. Do you know everybody?

182
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,684
No. Have you seen David?

183
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,520
No, he hasn't been around.

184
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,274
Well, if you see him, tell him
to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.

185
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,611
-Minsk?
-Minsk. It's in Russia.

186
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,697
I know where Minsk is.

187
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,325
Ha, ha. We got the grant.

188
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,536
Three years, all expenses paid.

189
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,330
So when do you leave?

190
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,207
January 1st.

191
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,511
Hello?

192
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,847
-Hey. Hi. Hi.
-Hi.

193
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,184
-What are you doing here?
-Um, well, Max told me about Minsk.

194
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,312
So you know, congratulations.
This is so exciting!

195
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,189
MAX:
Yeah.

196
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,525
It'd be even more exciting,
if we were going.

197
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,195
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

198
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,863
Tell her, David.

199
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,200
"I don't want to go to Minsk to work
with Lipson and Yamaguchi and Flank.

200
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:09,080
No, no, no. I want to stay here
and make out with my girlfriend."

201
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,041
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.

202
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,169
So you're really not going?

203
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,589
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm gonna do. I just....

204
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,675
You decide.

205
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,010
-Oh, don't do that.
-Please?

206
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,262
No, but I'm asking you.
I can't make a decision.

207
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,098
-I can't. Please, just-
-Okay. Stay.

208
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,810
-Stay.
-Stay.

209
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,029
Getting so good at that.

210
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,323
It was Max's stuff.

211
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,209
I love this artichoke thing.

212
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,963
Oh, don't tell me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

213
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,386
You remember Janice.

214
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,097
Vividly.

215
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,607
MONICA: Hi.
-Hi, I'm Sandy.

216
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,651
Sandy, hi. Come on in. Hey.

217
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,994
Ha, ha.

218
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,039
-You brought your kids.
-Yeah. That's okay, right?

219
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,919
Party.

220
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,838
That thing is not coming in here.

221
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,509
"That thing"? This is how
you greet guests at a party?

222
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,303
Let me ask you something.
If I showed up with my new girlfriend...

223
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,971
...she wouldn't be welcome?

224
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,100
I'm thinking your new girlfriend
wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

225
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,854
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

226
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:02,652
Okay? And for him to have the courage
to walk back in here...

227
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,529
...like nothing happened....

228
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,741
All right. All right.
Just keep him away from me.

229
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,369
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

230
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,539
What do you say you and I
do a little mingling?

231
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:19,502
All right, I'll, uh, catch up with you later.

232
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,885
Oh, my gosh. Rachel, honey...

233
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,180
...are you okay? Where's Paolo?

234
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,976
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.

235
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,978
And then your face exploded?

236
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,899
No. Okay.

237
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,777
I was at the airport getting into a cab...

238
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,654
...when this woman...

239
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,407
...this blond planet with a pocketbook...

240
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,617
...starts yelling at me.

241
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,495
Something about how
it was her cab first.

242
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,749
And the next thing I know, she just
starts pulling me out by my hair.

243
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,752
And I started blowing
my attack whistle thingy...

244
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,922
...and then three more cabs show up.

245
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,552
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackles me.

246
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:15,266
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my lip on my whistle.

247
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,105
Oh! Everybody having fun at the party?

248
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,484
Are people eating my dip?

249
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,829
You know, when I saw you
at the store last week...

250
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,876
...it was probably the first time
I ever mentally undressed an elf.

251
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,130
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.

252
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,257
-Ha, ha.
-Yeah.

253
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,262
Hey, kids.

254
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,643
Look at him. I'm not saying he has
to spend the whole evening with me...

255
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,020
...but at least check in.

256
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,023
There you are.

257
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,277
You got away from me.

258
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,571
But you found me.

259
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,531
Here, Ross, take our picture.

260
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,284
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

261
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,205
Kill me. Kill me now. Ha, ha.

262
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,543
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

263
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,254
ALL:
Fun Bobby!

264
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,505
MONICA:
Hey, Bobby.

265
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,259
Hey, sorry I'm late.
But my, uh, grandfather...

266
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,219
...died about two hours ago.

267
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:37,598
But I couldn't get a flight
out till tomorrow, so...

268
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,225
...here I am.

269
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,978
Hey, Fun Bobby. How's it going, man?

270
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,938
Whoa. Who died?

271
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,570
It's going to be an open casket,
you know?

272
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:56,575
So at least I'll get to see him again.

273
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm gonna blow this one up and
I'm gonna write "Reunited" in glitter.

274
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,377
All right, Janice, that's it!

275
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,130
Janice? Janice? Ahem.

276
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,881
Hey, Janice?

277
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,218
When I invited you to this party,
I didn't think it meant that we-

278
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,595
Oh, no.

279
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,266
Oh, no.

280
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,060
-I'm sorry you misunderstood.
-Oh, my God.

281
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,855
You listen to me, Chandler.
You listen to me.

282
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:30,610
One of these times, it's just gonna be
your last chance with me.

283
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,780
Oh, will you give me the thing?

284
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,245
-Hi, Max.
-Yoko.

285
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,919
I've decided to go to Minsk without you.

286
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,380
Wow.

287
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,341
MAX:
It won't be the same...

288
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,468
...but it will still be Minsk.

289
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,345
Happy New Year.

290
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,598
Are you all right?

291
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,642
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

292
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,527
You're going to Minsk.

293
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,946
No, I'm not going to Minsk.

294
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,865
Oh, you are so going to Minsk.

295
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,077
You belong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just because of me.

296
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,830
Yes, I can. Because if I go,
it means I have to break up with you.

297
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,084
-And I can't break up with you.
-Oh, yes. Yes, you can.

298
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,672
Just say, uh, "Phoebe, I love you,
but my work is my life.

299
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,632
And that's what I have to do right now."

300
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,718
And I say, "Your work? Your work?
How can you say that?"

301
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,014
And then you say, urn,
"It's tearing me apart...

302
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,934
...but I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?"

303
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:49,063
And I say, "No.
No. I can't understand that."

304
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,732
-Uh, ow.
-Sorry. Urn....

305
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,486
And then you put
your arms around me....

306
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:59,073
-And then you put your arms around me.
-Oh, oh. Sorry.

307
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,661
And, urn- And then you tell me you love me
and you'll never forget me.

308
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,997
I'll never forget you.

309
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,377
And then you say that it's almost midnight
and you have to go...

310
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:16,048
...because you don't want to start
the new year with me if you can't finish it.

311
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,223
I'm gonna miss you...

312
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,267
...you scientist guy.

313
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,479
<i>Hi, this is Dick Clark live
in Times Square.</i>

314
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:35,609
<i>We're in a virtual snowstorm
of confetti here in Times Square.</i>

315
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,528
<i>It gets bigger and better every year.</i>

316
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,530
Here you go, kids.

317
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,492
And then the peacock bit me. Ha, ha.

318
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,536
Please kiss me at midnight.

319
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,753
-You seen Sandy?
-Ooh. I don't know how to tell you this...

320
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,632
...but, uh, she's in Monica's bedroom
getting it on with Max, that scientist geek.

321
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,469
Oh, look at that.
I did know how to tell you.

322
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,805
Hey, everybody, the ball is going.

323
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,474
GROUP:
What?

324
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,893
The ball is dropping.

325
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,898
CLARK :
<i>In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.</i>

326
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,067
And the moment of joy is upon us.

327
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,488
Looks like that "no-date pact" thing
worked out.

328
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,282
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.

329
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,826
Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby.

330
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,458
GROUP:
One. Happy New Year!

331
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,837
You know, I just thought I'd throw this
out there. I'm no math whiz...

332
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:41,675
...but I do believe there are three girls
and three guys right here.

333
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,055
Oh, I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.

334
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,390
I can't kiss anyone.

335
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,351
So I'm kissing everyone?

336
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,270
No, no, no. You can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

337
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,066
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

338
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,609
All right. Somebody kiss me.

339
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:02,613
Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.
Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.

340
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,865
All right. All right. All right.

341
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,325
There.

342
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,377
I wanted this to work so much.

343
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,504
I'm still in there, you know?

344
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,924
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.

345
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,010
But he's just phoning it in.

346
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,764
It's just so hard to accept
that something you love so much...

347
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,308
...doesn't love you back, you know?

348
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,812
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
